      <description>arXiv:2511.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the notion of strict laura algebras through the lens of $\tau$-tilting theory to define the family of algebras determined by $\tau$-slices. We show that the representation dimension of every algebra determined by $\tau$-slices satisfying mild conditions is at most three.</description>

      <title>Computational and Categorical Frameworks of Finite Ternary $\Gamma$-Semirings: Foundations, Algorithms, and Industrial Modeling Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study extends the structural theory of finite commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semirings into a computational and categorical framework for explicit classification and constructive reasoning.Methods: Constraint-driven enumeration algorithms are developed to generate all non-isomorphic finite ternary $\Gamma$-semirings satisfying closure, distributivity, and symmetry. Automorphism analysis, canonical labeling, and pruning strategies ensure uniqueness and tractability, while categorical constructs formalize algebraic relationships. \textit{Results:} The implementation classifies all systems of order $|T|\!\le\!4$ and verifies symmetry-based subvarieties. Complexity analysis confirms polynomial-time performance, and categorical interpretation connects ternary $\Gamma$-semirings with functorial models in universal algebra. \\ Conclusion: The work establishes a verified computational theory and categorical synthesis for finite ternary $\Gamma$-semirings, integrating algebraic structure, algorithmic enumeration, and symbolic computation to support future industrial and decision-model applications.</description>

      <title>Complete and cocomplete Lie algebras with injective and projective properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the classical correspondence between short exact sequences and splitting properties in module theory, this paper examines the projective and injective analogues within the category of Lie algebras. We first show that no Lie algebra can serve as a projective or injective object with respect to arbitrary extensions, thereby clarifying the natural limitations of this analogy. To recover meaningful dual behaviors, we introduce two new notions: cocentral extensions and cocomplete Lie algebras, viewed as the natural dual counterparts of central extensions and complete Lie algebras. We prove that solvable complete Lie algebras exhibit an injective-like property, while cocomplete Lie algebras satisfying the vanishing of their second cohomology group with trivial coefficients act as projective-like objects. Moreover, we obtain a full classification of almost abelian cocomplete Lie algebras. These results establish a duality framework for completeness and cocompleteness in Lie algebra extensions, connecting structural, categorical, and cohomological aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}^{a,b}$ be the generalized quaternion algebra over a unitary commutative ring. This paper aims to investigate super-biderivations and local superderivations on the generalized quaternion algebra, which is viewed as a class of Lie superalgebra. It turns out that on generalized quaternion algebras, any local superderivation is a superderivation.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Foundations of Chemical Systems as Ternary Gamma-Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical transformations depend not only on the identities of the reacting species but also on the catalytic, environmental, and intermediate conditions under which they occur. Classical binary reaction formalisms usually treat such condi- tions as external annotations, which obscures the genuinely multi-state and multi- parameter character of real chemical processes. In this paper we introduce an axiomatic framework in which a chemical system is modelled by a ternary {\Gamma}-semiring. The elements of the state set represent chemical states, while the parameter set encodes catalytic and environmental conditions. A {\Gamma}- dependent ternary operation is used to describe mediated transformations, treating reactants, intermediates, and mediators as intrinsic arguments of the transformation law. We develop the algebraic axioms governing these mediated interactions and in- terpret their associativity, distributivity, and {\Gamma}-linearity in terms of multi-step path- ways, parallel processes, and controlled environmental dependence. We introduce chemical ideals and {\Gamma}-ideals as algebraic structures modelling reaction-closed sub- systems and pathway-stable domains, and study their prime and semiprime forms. Homomorphisms between TGS-chemical systems are shown to preserve reaction pathways and describe consistent changes of chemical environment. Abstract examples from catalysis, thermodynamic phase control, and field- induced quantum transitions illustrate how familiar chemical phenomena fit within this framework. The resulting theory provides a unified algebraic foundation for multi-parameter chemical behaviour and establishes the structural basis for subse- quent developments involving kinetics, geometric methods, and computational or AI-assisted models.</description>

      <title>Finitely Generated Congruences in Semirings and Canonical Positive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we inspect a relatively unexplored notion of finite generation in semirings, namely semirings in which all congruences are finitely generated. Such semirings are dubbed Congruence Noetherian. After developing sufficient background and examples, we focus on the canonical positive models of a real order and show that this obvious choice, though not finitely generated as an $\mathbb{N}$-module, is both Congruence Noetherian and flat over $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Finitary conditions in special semidirect products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of finitary conditions for monoids arising as expansions via the semidirect product construction of a monoid $M$ acting on the left of its power set (which we term `special semidirect products', and denote by $\mathcal{S}(M)$). Specifically, we examine the condition of weak left coherence (every finitely generated left ideal has a finite presentation as a left act); the related conditions of property (L), left ideal Howson, finitely left equated; and the left-right dual properties of weak right coherence, property (R), right ideal Howson and finitely right equated. Each of these conditions is preserved under retract, from which it is immediate that if $\mathcal{S}(M)$ satisfies one of our finitary conditions, then so must $M$, but the converse is not true. Indeed, we show that $\mathcal{S}(M)$ satisfies property (L) (or property (R)) if and only if $M$ is finite. We provide a characterisation of the monoids $M$ such that $\mathcal{S}(M)$ is left (respectively, right) ideal Howson, and give sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{S}(M)$ to be finitely left (respectively, right) equated and hence weakly left (respectively, right) coherent.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic Matrices and Power Difference Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclotomic matrix is commonly used to arrange cyclotomic numbers in a convenient format. A natural question is whether the structure of the matrix can reflect properties of these numbers. In this article, we examine cyclotomic numbers through their associated cyclotomic matrix and reveal an algebraic structure by relating it to a basis element of a Schur ring. This viewpoint leads to structural identities and reinterpretations of classical results. As an application, we investigate the power difference set problem and establish conditions expressed through cyclotomic matrices, including spectral and determinant characterizations.</description>

      <title>On the classification of quantum symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in order to classify Hopf algebra (co)actions on a given finite dimensional algebra up to equivalence, one should start with the classification of the possible cosupports (i.e. the sets of linear operators by which $H^*$ is acting) of Hopf algebra coactions and then consider dual Hopf algebra actions. As an application, we classify quantum symmetries of the set of two points and the algebra of dual numbers. In addition, we show that the straight line does not admit an (ungraded) universal coacting Manin Hopf algebra. Moreover, we prove that for $n\geqslant 14$ the full matrix algebra $M_n(\mathbb k)$ admits a nontrivial Hopf algebra coaction such that all Hopf algebra actions with the same restriction on the cosupport are trivial, i.e. the cosupport may reduce under the dualization and a finite dimensional algebra may have less equivalence classes of actions than coactions. Simultaneously, for any $n\geqslant 14$, we define an elementary grading on $M_n(\mathbb k)$ by an infinite group that cannot be regraded by any finite group. (The previously known lower bound was $n\geqslant 349$.)</description>

      <title>Cayley--Hamilton Theorem for Orthogonal Quantum Matrix Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a family of the orthogonal $O(k)$ type Quantum Matrix algebras we establish an analogue of the Cayley--Hamilton theorem. The form of the Cayley-Hamilton identity is different in three cases. First, the cases of odd ($k=2\ell -1$) and even ($k=2\ell$) heights are different. Second, for even height orthogonal Quantum Matrix algebra we derive two versions of the Cayley--Hamilton theorem, one for its positive component $O^+(2\ell)$ and another one for the negative component $O^-(2\ell)$. In each case we introduce the spectral parameterization of the coefficients of the Cayley--Hamilton identity by the `eigenvalues' of the quantum matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiedorowicz suggested that it was likely that every finite simply connected CW complex is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup. We prove that every finite wedge of simply connected Moore spaces of finitely generated abelian groups is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup. Consequently, homology groups alone cannot preclude a finite simply connected CW complex from being homotopy equivalent to the classifying space of a finite semigroup.</description>

In this paper, we generalize this result to abelian monoidal categories through Frobenius subalgebras. As an application, we show that certain morphisms on a C*-correspondence arise from intermediate C*-subalgebras if and only if they are averaging operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Lie conformal algebroids (LCAd) and their representations using the language of lambda-brackets and Lie conformal algebras. We describe several general constructions, such as the LCAd of conformal derivations CDer(A) of a differential algebra A, the gauge LCAd G(A,M) associated to a differential algebra A and its module M, the current LCAd F^ of a Lie algebroid F, and the LCAd structure of the space Omega(V) of Kahler differentials over a Poisson vertex algebra (PVA) V. We develop the cohomology theories of LCAd and we relate them to the corresponding cohomology theories of PVA. In particular, we find an isomorphism between the cohomology of a PVA V with coefficients in a module M and the corresponding cohomology of the LCAd Omega(V) with coefficients in the same module.</description>

      <title>A new generalization of the Narayana numbers inspired by linear operators on associative $d$-ary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalization of the Narayana numbers $N_d(n,k) = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k+1} \binom{ n + (n-k)(d-2)+1}{k}$ for integers $d \geq 2$ and $n,k \geq 0$. This two-parameter array extends the classical Narayana numbers ($d=2$) and yields a $d$-ary analogue of the Catalan numbers $C_d(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n N_d(n,k)$. We give nine combinatorial interpretations of $N_d(n,k)$ that unify and generalize known combinatorial interpretations of the Narayana numbers and $C_3(n)$ in the literature. In particular, we show that $N_d(n,k)$ counts a natural class of operator monomials over a $d$-ary associative algebra, thereby extending a result of Bremner and Elgendy for the binary case. We also construct explicit bijections between these monomials and several families of classic combinatorial objects, including Schr\"{o}der paths, Dyck paths, rooted ordered trees, and $231$-avoiding permutations.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Chan and Nyman constructed noncommutative projective lines via a noncommutative symmetric algebra for a bimodule $V$ over a pair of fields. These noncommutative projective lines of contain a canonical closed subscheme (the point scheme) determined by a normal family of elements in the noncommutative symmetric algebra. We study the complement of this subscheme when $V$ is simple, the coordinate ring of which is obtained by inverting said normal family. We show that this localised ring is a noncommutative Dedekind domain of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 1. Furthermore, the question of simplicity of these Dedekind domains is answered by a similar dichotomy to an analogous open subscheme of the noncommutative quadrics of Artin, Tate and Van den Bergh.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galois rings and orders, introduced by Futorny and Ovsienko, are embedded into fixed subrings of skew group (or monoid) rings and have many interesting applications to the structure and representation theory of algebras. The paper focuses on their ring theoretical properties which can be deduced from the properties of the associated skew group rings via a localization procedure. In particular, we obtain natural conditions for our rings to be Ore domains and (semi)prime Goldie rings. We also discuss various ring theoretical dimensions and combine powerful theories of Galois rings and PI-rings. Furthermore, we compute dimensions and establish structural properties of spherical Coulomb branch algebras, and show that they verify the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture. Similar results are obtained for affine and double affine Hecke algebras.</description>

There are two sensible notions of quantum automorphism group for any such: $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal G)$, capturing the quantum symmetries of the adjacency matrix $A:M_n\to M_n$ attached to $\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal S\le M_n)$, the quantum group acting universally on $M_n$ so as to preserve its $C^*$ structure, standard trace, and subspace $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$. The two quantum groups coincide classically, but diverge in general. We nevertheless show that both are generically trivial in the sense that they are so for $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$ ranging over a non-empty Zariski-open set under all reasonable dimensional constraints on $\dim \mathcal{S}$ and $n$.
  This extends analogous prior results by the first and third authors to the effect that classical symmetry groups of still-quantum graphs are generically trivial, and offers a fully quantum counterpart to the familiar probabilistic almost-rigidity of finite graphs. An auxiliary result sheds some light on the relationship between the two notions of quantum automorphism group, identifying the universal preserver of the quantum adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ with the quantum automorphism group not of $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$, but rather of the complex conjugate $\overline{\mathcal{S}}\le M_n$.</description>
