      <title>Nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in three-dimensional chiral fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral fermionic quasiparticles emerge in certain quantum condensed matter systems such as Weyl semimetals, topological insulators, and spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals. Here, a comprehensive theory of the chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (CNLAHE) is developed for three-dimensional chiral quasiparticles, advancing previous models by rigorously including momentum-dependent chirality-preserving and chirality-breaking scattering processes and global charge conservation. Focusing on two specific systems-Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and spinorbit coupled non-centrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs), we uncover that the nonlinear anomalous Hall conductivity in WSMs shows nonmonotonic behavior with the Weyl cone tilt and experiences a "strong-sign-reversal" with increasing internode scattering, diverging from earlier predictions. For SOC-NCMs, where nonlinear anomalous Hall conductivity has been less explored, we reveal that unlike WSM, the orbital magnetic moment alone can drive a large CNLAHE with distinctive features: the CNLAH conductivity remains consistently negative regardless of interband scattering intensity and exhibits a quadratic dependence on the magnetic field, contrasting the linear dependence in WSMs. Furthermore, we discover that in SOC-NCMs the Zeeman coupling of the magnetic field acts like an effective tilt term which can further enhance the CNLAH current. These findings offer fresh insights into the nonlinear transport dynamics of chiral quasiparticles and can be verified in upcoming experiments on such materials.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Enhanced Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting electrons in a topologically non trivial band may form exotic phases of matter. An especially intriguing example of which is the fractional quantum anomalous Hall phase, recently discovered in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides and in moir\'e graphene multilayers. However, it has been shown to be destabilized in certain filling factors at sub-100 mK temperatures in pentalayer graphene, in favor of a novel integer quantum anomalous Hall phase [Z. Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203 ]. We propose that the culprit stabilizing the fractional phase at higher temperatures is its rich edge state structure. Possessing a multiplicity of chiral modes on its edge, the fractional phase has lower free energy at higher temperatures due to the excess edge modes entropy. We make distinct predictions under this scenario, including the system-size dependency of the fractional phase entropic enhancement, and how the phase boundaries change as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion soliton motion on periodic substrates by atomistic and particle based simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the dynamical behavior of magnetic skyrmions interacting with square and triangular defect arrays just above commensuration using both an atomistic model and a particle-based model. Under an applied drive, the initial motion is a kink traveling through the pinned skyrmion lattice. For the square defect array, both models agree well and show a regime in which the soliton motion is locked along 45$^\circ$. The atomistic model also produces locking of a soliton along 30$^\circ$, while the particle-based model does not. For the triangular defect array, the atomistic model exhibits soliton motion locked to 30$^\circ$ over a wide region of external driving force values. In contrast, the particle-based model gives soliton motion locked to 45$^\circ$ over only a small range of external driving force values. The difference arises because the nondeforming particle model facilitates meandering skyrmion orbits while the deformable atomistic model enables stronger skyrmion-skyrmion interactions that reduce the meandering. Our results indicate that soliton motion through pinned skyrmion lattices on a periodic substrate is a robust effect and could open the possibility of using solitons as information carriers. Our results also provide a better understanding of the regimes for which particle-based models of skyrmions are best suited.</description>

      <title>Dirac excited state quenching in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot, dense phases of Dirac fermions - predicted to resemble relativistic plasma - are uniquely accessible through photoexcitation of pristine, charge neutral graphene. We demonstrate a sensitive temperature probe of the photoexcited Dirac state, called interlayer optoelectronic thermometry, which measures out-of-plane transport of hot carriers in high-mobility, neutral graphene encapsulated within graphene-hBN-graphene heterostructures. At a critical intermediate sample temperature T = 50 K, the electronic temperature Te is quenched, exhibiting an intrinsic cooling rate that exceeds 10^14 Kelvin/s within the first picosecond after photoexcitation. Quenching is further enhanced by applying in-plane voltages within the stack-engineered heterostructure. Extreme sensitivity of Te to sample temperature and applied voltages reveals anomalously efficient hot-carrier quenching, which we identify as an essential feature of the strongly interacting hot Dirac excited state.</description>

      <title>Origin of the laser-induced picosecond spin current across magnetization compensation in ferrimagnetic GdCo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical manipulation of magnetism enabled by rare earth-transition metal ferrimagnets holds the promise of ultrafast, energy efficient spintronic technologies. This work investigates laser-induced picosecond spin currents generated by ferrimagnetic GdCo via terahertz emission spectroscopy. A suppression of the THz emission and spin current is observed at magnetization compensation when varying the temperature or alloy composition in the presence of a magnetic field. It is demonstrated that this is due to the formation of domains in the GdCo equilibrium magnetic configuration. Without an applied magnetic field, the picosecond spin current persists at the compensation point. The experimental findings support the model for THz spin current generation based on transport of hot spin-polarized electrons, which is dominated by the Co sublattice at room temperature. Only at low temperature a comparable contribution from Gd is detected but with slower dynamics. Finally, spectral analysis reveals a blueshift of the THz emission related to the formation of magnetic domains close to magnetization compensation.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady-state thermoelectrics of Kondo-correlated quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport across a Kondo-correlated quantum dot coupled to two leads with independent temperatures and chemical potentials is studied using a controlled non-perturbative, and in this sense exact numeric treatment based on a hybrid numerical renormalization group combined with time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (NRG-tDMRG). We find a peak in the conductance at finite voltage bias vs. the temperature gradient $\Delta T = T_R - T_L$ across left and right lead. We then focus predominantly on zero voltage bias but finite $\Delta T$ far beyond linear response. We reveal the dependence of the characteristic zero-bias conductance on the individual lead temperatures. We find that the finite-$\Delta T$ data behaves quantitatively similar to linear response with an effective equilibrium temperature derived from the different lead temperatures. The regime of sign changes in the Seebeck coefficient, signaling the presence of Kondo correlations, and its dependence on the individual lead temperatures provide a complete picture of the Kondo regime in the presence of finite temperature gradients. The results from the zero-bias conductance and Seebeck coefficient studies unveil an approximate `Kondo circle' in the $T_L/T_R$ plane as the regime within which the Kondo correlations dominate. We also study the heat current and the corresponding heat conductance vs. finite $\Delta T$. We provide a polynomial fit for our numerical results for the thermocurrent as a function of the individual lead temperatures which may be used to fit experimental data in the Kondo regime.</description>

      <title>Exceptional topology in Non-Hermitian Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene has extraordinary electronic properties at the magic angle along with an isolated flat band at magic angle. However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of Bistritzer-MacDonald(BM) model, we find Dirac cones centered at $K'$ corner of the moir\'e Brillouin zone deformed in the presence of non-Hermiticity. This is different from single layer graphene with gain and loss, where rings of exceptional points appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouion zone. The coincident of exceptional rings at $\Gamma_M$ point characterizes an ``exceptional magic angle", at which the system hosts flat bands with zero energy and finite lifetime. More interestingly, we find that the topological charge in the moir\'e Brillouin zone is conserved during the expansion and fusion of the exceptional ring, which is absent in two-dimensional systems constraining by Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. These findings can be demonstrated in realistic cold atom and metamaterial systems and will stimulate further study on non-Hermitian phenomena in twistronic.</description>

      <title>Fermi Liquid Theory for Spin Current of a Ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent work [arXiv:2402.04639] considered spin dynamics for ferromagnets using Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics with fundamental variables magnetization $\vec{M}$ and spin current $\vec{J}_{i}$. In that theory, as in the Landau-Lifshitz theory for ferromagnets, $\partial_{t}\vec{M}$ can decay; but unlike in Landau-Lifshitz, $\partial_{t}\vec{M}$ cannot diffuse. As in Leggett's Fermi liquid theory for the nuclear paramagnet $^{3}$He, $\partial_{t}\vec{J}_{i}$contains a term varying as $\partial_{i}\vec{M}$ that we interpret as associated with a vector spin pressure, and a term giving a mean-field along $\vec{M}$, about which $\vec{J}_{i}$ precesses. Just as for the paramagnet Leggett evaluated the coefficients of these two terms using the Fermi liquid quasi-particle interaction parameters, the present work does the same for the ferromagnet. In the paramagnetic limit it agrees with Leggett and related work.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Winding Tuple for Non-Hermitian Topological Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topological localization and non-Hermiticity localization in non-Hermitian crystal systems results in a diversity of shapes of topological edge modes (EMs), offering opportunities to manipulate these modes for potential topological applications. The conventional strategy for characterizing the domain of EMs is to calculate the topological invariants, but which does not provide the wavefunction forms of EMs. This leads to the the bulk-boundary correspondence typically being verified only through numerical methods. In this work, by recognizing EMs as specified solutions of eigenequation, we derive their wavefunctions in an extended non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We then inversely construct a winding tuple $\left \{ w_{\scriptscriptstyle GBZ},w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}\right \} $ that characterizes the existence of EMs and their spatial distribution. Moreover, we define a new spectral winding number equivalent to $w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}$, which is determined by the product of energies of different bands. The inverse design of topological invariants allows us to categorize the localized nature of EMs even in systems lacking sublattice symmetry, which can facilitate the manipulation and utilization of EMs in the development of novel quantum materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous hysteresis in local STM tunnel conductance with gate-voltage in single-layer MoS$_2$ on SiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomly distributed traps at the MoS$_2$/SiO$_2$ interface result in non-ideal transport behavior, including hysteresis in MoS$_2$/SiO$_2$ field effect transistors (FETs). Thus traps are mostly detrimental to the FET performance but they also offer some application potential. Our STM/S measurements on atomically resolved few-layer and single-layer MoS$_2$ on SiO$_2$ show n-doped behavior with the expected band gap close to 2.0 and 1.4 eV, respectively. The local tunnel conductance with gate-voltage $V_{\rm g}$ sweep exhibits a turn-on/off at a threshold $V_{\rm g}$ at which the tip's Fermi-energy nearly coincides with the local conduction band minimum. This threshold value is found to depend on $V_{\rm g}$ sweep direction amounting to local hysteresis. The hysteresis is, expectedly, found to depend on both the extent and rate of $V_{\rm g}$-sweep. Further, the spatial variation in the local $V_{\rm g}$ threshold and the details of tunnel conductance Vs $V_{\rm g}$ behavior indicate inhomogenieties in both the traps' density and their energy distribution. The latter even leads to the pinning of the local Fermi energy in some regions. Further, some rare locations exhibit a p-doping with both p and n-type $V_{\rm g}$-thresholds in local conductance and an unusual hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Role of anisotropic confining potential and elliptical driving in dynamics of a Ge hole qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The squeezing of a Ge planar quantum dot significantly enhances the Rabi frequency of electric dipole spin resonance due to a strong Direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction (DR-SOI) in such geometries [Phys. Rev. B 104, 115425 (2021)]. We explore how an elliptical (squeezed) confinement and the driving field's polarization affect the Rabi frequency of a heavy-hole qubit in a planar Ge quantum dot. To compute the Rabi frequency, we focus on $p$-linear spin-orbit interactions (SOIs), specifically the electron-like Rashba, hole-like Rashba, and hole-like Dresselhaus SOIs, which dominate in planar Ge heterostructures. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for small SOI and driving strengths, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the Rabi frequency. For an out-of-plane magnetic field with magnitude $B$, we identify an operational region defined by $B$, squeezing, and polarization parameters, where 'clean' Rabi flips occur. Near the boundaries of this region, interference from higher orbital levels disrupts the two-level qubit subspace and degrades Rabi oscillations, imposing a limit on confinement squeezing. The Rabi frequency behaves differently for electron-like and hole-like Rashba SOIs, vanishing under right (left) circular polarization when only electron-like (hole-like) Rashba SOI is present in a circular confinement. For an in-plane magnetic field, the Rabi frequency is maximized for linear polarization when the driving electric field is parallel (perpendicular) to the magnetic field in the presence of purely Rashba (Dresselhaus) SOI. In both magnetic field orientations, higher Rabi frequencies are obtained in squeezed configurations when the major axes of the polarization ellipse and the confinement equipotential are aligned but have different eccentricities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing well-defined magnetic nanomaterials is crucial for various applications and demands a comprehensive understanding of their magnetic properties at the microscopic level. In this study, we investigate the contributions to the total anisotropy of Mn-Co mixed spinel nanoparticles. By employing neutron measurements sensitive to the spatially resolved surface anisotropy with sub-A resolution, we reveal the discrepancy between the excess anisotropy that can be explained by the shape anisotropy and interparticle interactions. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between chemical composition, microstructure, morphology, and surface effects and provide valuable insights for the design of advanced magnetic nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits based on topological pumping in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis of digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate between nearest neighbours, many circuits require non-local connectivity, necessitating some form of quantum information transport, such as the repeated application of SWAP gates or qubit shuttling. Preserving motional coherence during such transport remains a key challenge to improve gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, as well as to connect local fermionic modes. Here we combine tuneable gate operations between fermionic potassium-40 atoms - based on superexchange interaction - with their bidirectional transport via topological Thouless pumping in an optical lattice. We demonstrate shuttling of atomic singlet pairs with a single-shift fidelity of 99.57(4)% over 50 lattice sites. We spatially and coherently split a large number of randomly distributed fermionic spin singlet pairs and show $($SWAP$)^\alpha$-gate operations between atoms encountering each other during transport. As a signature of entanglement between fermions separated over large distances and interwoven with each other, we observe multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Topological pumping is generally applicable to long-lived atomic and molecular states, and specifically overcomes lifetime limitations inherent to transport using state-dependent optical lattices. Our work opens up new avenues for transport of quantum information and offers unprecedented possibilities for engineering connectivity in quantum circuits, including approaches based on fermionic modes, as well as for atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Superconductivity Atop the False Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A many body system in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition may get trapped in a local minimum of the free energy landscape. These so-called false-vacuum states may survive for exceedingly long times if the barrier for their decay is high enough. The rich phase diagram obtained in graphene multilayer devices presents a unique opportunity to explore transient superconductivity on top of a correlated false vacuum. Specifically, we consider superconductors which are terminated by an apparent first-order phase transition to a correlated phase with different symmetry. We propose that quenching across this transition leads to a non-equilibrium ephemeral superconductor, readily detectable using straightforward transport measurements. Besides enabling a simple detection scheme, the transient superconductor also generically enhances the false vacuum lifetime, potentially by orders of magnitude. In several scenarios, the complimentary effect takes place as well: superconductivity is temporarily emboldened in the false vacuum, albeit ultimately decaying. We demonstrate the applicability of these claims for two different instances of superconductivity terminated by a first order transition in rhombohedral graphene. The obtained decay timescales position this class of materials as a promising playground to unambiguously realize and measure non-equilibrium superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric protocols for fast high-fidelity adiabatic state transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient control schemes that enable fast, high-fidelity operations are essential for any practical quantum computation. However, current optimization protocols are intractable due to stringent requirements imposed by the microscopic systems encoding the qubit, including dense energy level spectra and cross talk, and generally require a trade-off between speed and fidelity of the operation. Here, we address these challenges by developing a general framework for optimal control based on the quantum metric tensor. This framework allows for fast and high-fidelity adiabatic pulses, even for a dense energy spectrum, based solely on the Hamiltonian of the system instead of the full time evolution propagator and independent of the size of the underlying Hilbert space. Furthermore, the framework suppresses diabatic transitions and state-dependent crosstalk effects without the need for additional control fields. As an example, we study the adiabatic charge transfer in a double quantum dot to find optimal control pulses with improved performance. We show that for the geometric protocol, the transfer fidelites are lower bounded $F&gt;99\%$ for ultrafast 20 ns pulses, regardless of the size of the anti-crossing.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Nonlinear Hall Effect Induced by Lorentz Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect arises either without external magnetic field (type-I) or with an in-plane magnetic field (type-II). In this work we propose a new type of geometrical nonlinear Hall effect with an out-of-plane magnetic field (type-III) induced by the combination of Lorentz force and anomalous electronic velocity. The type-III NLH effect is proportional to the more refined structures of Bloch wave functions, i.e., the dipole moment of square of Berry curvature, thus becoming prominent near the band crossings or anticrossings. Our effective model analysis and first-principles calculations show that gate-tuned MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin film under uniaxial strain is an ideal platform to observe this effect. Especially, giant unidirectional magnetoresistance can occur in this material, based on which an efficient electrical transistor device prototype can be built. Finally a symmetry analysis indicates that type-III NLH effect has unique symmetry properties stemming from Berry curvature square dipole, which is different from other previously reported NLH effects and can exist in a wider class of magnetic crystals. Our study offers new paradigms for nonlinear electronics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kagome Materials: Theoretical Insights, Experimental Realizations, and Electronic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, kagome materials have attracted significant attention due to their rich emergent phenomena arising from the quantum interplay of geometry, topology, spin, and correlations. However, in the search for kagome materials, it has been found that bulk compounds with electronic properties related to the kagome lattice are relatively scarce, primarily due to the hybridization of kagome layers with adjacent layers. Therefore, researchers have shown increasing interest in the construction of two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials, aiming to achieve clean kagome bands near the Fermi level in monolayer or few-layer systems. Substantial advancements have already been made in this area. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the construction and development of 2D kagome lattices. We begin by introducing the geometric and electronic structures of the kagome lattice and its variants. This is followed by a discussion on the experimental realizations and electronic structure characterizations of 2D kagome materials. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future development of 2D kagome lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a pronounced light upconversion in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our joint theory-experiment study attributes the upconversion photoluminescence to a resonant exciton-exciton annihilation involving a pair of dark excitons with opposite momenta, followed by the spontaneous emission of upconverted bright excitons, which can have a high upconversion efficiency. Additionally, the upconversion photoluminescence is generic in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, showing a high tuneability from green to ultraviolet light.</description>

      <title>Doping the spin-polarized Graphene minicone on Ni(111)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the attempt to induce spin-polarized states in graphene, rare-earth deposition on Gr/Co(0001) has been demonstrated to be a successful strategy: the coupling of graphene with the cobalt substrate provides spin-polarized conical-shaped states (mini-cone) and the rare-earth deposition brings these states at the Fermi level. In this manuscript we theoretically explore the feasibility of an analogue approach applied on Gr/Ni(111) doped with rare-earth ions. Even if not well mentioned in the lecture also this system owns a mini-cone, similar to the cobalt case. By testing different rare-earth ions, not only we suggest which one can provide the required doping but we explain the effect behind this proper charge transfer.</description>

      <title>Medium-enhanced polaron repulsion in a dilute Bose mixture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental problem of a small density of bosonic impurities immersed in a dilute Bose gas at zero temperature. Within the perturbative regime of weak interactions, we show that the presence of the surrounding medium can lead to an enhanced repulsion between dressed bosonic impurities (polarons) rather than an induced attraction, in contrast to prevailing theories. Moreover, we find that the induced polaron-polaron interactions only become attractive when the impurity-boson interactions are sufficiently strong that the system is unstable towards either phase separation or collapse/droplet formation. Our work highlights the role of polaron condensation in polaron-polaron interactions, and it has important implications for theories of induced interactions in general.</description>

      <title>Surface Magnetism in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface magnetization of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ was examined by low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) using an off-normal incidence electron beam. We found that the 180$^o$ domain walls are of Bloch type. Temperature-dependent LEEM measurements yield a surface magnetization with a surface critical exponent $\beta$1 = 0.79 +/- 0.02. This result is consistent with surface magnetism in the 3D semi-infinite Heisenberg ($\beta$1 = 0.84 +/- 0.01) or Ising ($\beta$1 = 0.78 +/- 0.02) models, which is distinctly different from the bulk exponent ($\beta$ = 0.34 +/- 0.07). The measurements reveal the power of LEEM with a tilted beam to determine magnetic domain structure in quantum materials. Single crystal diffraction measurements reveal inversion symmetry-breaking weak peaks and yield space group P-6m2. This Fe site defect-derived loss of inversion symmetry enables the formation of skyrmions in this Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ crystal.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the integration of hexagonal boron nitride crystals and thin films into graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a benchmarking protocol that combines the characterization of boron nitride (BN) crystals and films with the evaluation of the electronic properties of graphene on these substrates. Our study includes hBN crystals grown under different conditions and scalable BN films deposited by either chemical or physical vapor deposition (CVD or PVD). We explore the complete process from boron nitride growth, over its optical characterization by time-resolved cathodoluminescence (TRCL), to the optical and electronic characterization of graphene by Raman spectroscopy after encapsulation and Hall bar processing. Within our benchmarking protocol we achieve a homogeneous electronic performance within each Hall bar device through a fast and reproducible processing routine. We find that a free exciton lifetime of 1 ns measured on as-grown hBN crystals by TRCL is sufficient to achieve high graphene room temperature charge carrier mobilities of 80,000 cm$^2$/(Vs) at a carrier density of |n| = 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, while respective exciton lifetimes around 100 ps yield mobilities up to 30,000 cm$^2$/(Vs). For scalable PVD-grown BN films, we measure carrier mobilities exceeding 10,000 cm$^2$/(Vs) which correlates with a graphene Raman 2D peak linewidth of 22 cm$^{-1}$. Our work highlights the importance of the Raman 2D linewidth of graphene as a critical metric that effectively assesses the interface quality (i.e. surface roughness) to the BN substrate, which directly affects the charge carrier mobility of graphene. Graphene 2D linewidth analysis is suitable for all BN substrates and is particularly advantageous when TRCL or BN Raman spectroscopy cannot be applied to specific BN materials such as amorphous or thin films. This underlines the superior role of spatially-resolved spectroscopy in the evaluation of BN crystals and films for the use of high-mobility graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of scalar potential induced topological transition in massive Dirac fermions and scalar Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of scalar potential induced topological transition in massive Dirac fermions. We show how a distribution of scalar potential can manipulate the signature of the gap or the mass, as well as the dispersion leading to a band inversion. This is mediated by the Klein tunnelling as well as inverse Klein tunnelling which makes it inherently different from the mechanism leading to topological Anderson insulator. In one dimension it can lead to the formation of edge localisation. In two dimensions this can give rise to the quantised Hall effect. Unlike conventional Hall effects, this is induced by a scalar interaction and intrinsic in nature. Therefore we call it a scalar Hall effect. This can facilitate a direct manipulation of topological invariants, e.g. the Chern number, as well as the manipulation of the edge states locally in a trivial insulator and thus opens new possibilities for tuning physical observables which originate from the nontrivial topology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall and Light Responses in a 2D Topological Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have recently identified a protected topological semimetal in graphene which presents a zero-energy edge mode robust to disorder and interactions. Here, we address the characteristics of this semimetal and show that the $\mathbb{Z}$ topological invariant of the Hall conductivity associated to the lowest energy band can be equivalently measured from the resonant response to circularly polarized light resolved at the Dirac points. The (non-quantized) conductivity responses of the intermediate energy bands, including the Fermi surface, also give rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. We emphasize on the bulk-edge correspondence as a protected topological half metal, i.e. one spin-population polarized in the plane is in the insulating phase related to the robust edge mode while the other is in the metallic regime. The quantized transport at the edges is equivalent to a $\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}$ conductance for spin polarizations along $z$ direction. We also build a parallel between the topological Hall response and a pair of half numbers (half Skyrmions) through the light response locally resolved in momentum space and on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Theory of local $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers for finite and periodic two-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological phases of two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric insulators are classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological invariant. Usually, the invariant is introduced and calculated by exploiting the way time-reversal symmetry acts in reciprocal space, hence implicitly assuming periodicity and homogeneity. Here, we introduce two space-resolved $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers that are able to probe the local topology of the ground-state electronic structure also in the case of inhomogeneous and finite systems. The first approach leads to a generalized local spin-Chern marker, that usually remains well-defined also when the perpendicular component of the spin, $S_{z}$, is not conserved. The second marker is solely based on time-reversal symmetry, hence being more general. We validate our markers on the Kane-Mele model both in periodic and open boundary conditions, also in presence of disorder and including topological/trivial heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry in a Non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Periodic Hopping Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of periodic but commensurate hopping modulation on a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with an additional onsite staggered imaginary potential. Such dissipative, non-Hermitian (NH) extension amply modifies the features of the topological trivial phase (TTP) and the topological nontrivial phase (TNP) of the SSH chain, more so with the periodic hopping distribution. Generally a weak potential can respect the parity-time (PT ) symmetry keeping the energy eigenvalues real, while a strong potential breaks PT conservation leading to imaginary end state and complex bulk state energies in the system. We find that this PT breaking with imaginary potential strength \gamma show interesting dependence on the hopping modulation \Delta for different hoping modulations. In-gap states, that appear also in the \gamma = 0 limit, take either purely real or purely imaginary eigenvalues depending on the strength of both \gamma and \Delta. The localization of end states (in-gap states) at the boundaries are investigated which show extended nature not only near topological transitions (further away from |\Delta/t| = 1) but also near the unmodulated limit of \Delta = 0. Moreover, localization of the bulk states is observed at the maximally dimerized limit of |\Delta/t| = 1, which also have a {\gamma} dependence. Analyzing further the dissipation caused by the complex eigenvalues in this problem with different hopping periodicity can be essential in modulating the gain-loss contrast in optical systems or in designing various quantum information processing and storage devices.</description>

      <title>Emergent pair symmetries in systems with poor man's Majorana modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-site Kitaev chains are promising for realizing Majorana zero modes without topological protection but fully nonlocal, which are known as poor man's Majorana modes. While several signatures have already been reported both theoretically and experimentally, it still remains unknown what is the nature of superconducting correlations in the presence of poor man's Majorana modes. In this work, we study few-site Kitaev chains and demonstrate that they host pair correlations with distinct symmetries, entirely determined by the underlying quantum numbers. In particular, we find that a two-site Kitaev chain hosts local (odd-frequency) and nonlocal (odd- and even-frequency) pair correlations, both spin polarized and highly tunable by the system parameters. Interestingly, the odd-frequency pair correlations exhibit a divergent behaviour around zero frequency when the nonlocal $p$-wave pair potential and electron tunneling are of the same order, an effect that can be controlled by the onsite energies. Since a divergent odd-frequency pairing is directly connected to the intrinsic spatial nonlocality of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors, the divergent odd-frequency pairing here reflects the intrinsic Majorana nonlocality of poor man's Majorana modes but without any relation to topology. Our findings could help understanding the emergent pair correlations in few-site Kitaev chains.</description>

Abstract: Josephson elements are cornerstones of cryogenic classical and quantum superconducting technology, owing to their nonlinearity. Two important types of Josephson elements are often considered distinct: the tunnel junction (superconductor-insulator-superconductor, SIS) and the Andreev weak link (superconductor-normal-superconductor, SNS) referring to any non-superconducting and non-insulating central region. SNS junctions and SIS junctions have appeared in related technological and fundamental science contexts over the last decade, such as in the design of protected qubit concepts. In this perspective article, we review correspondences between SISIS junctions and SNS junctions in limiting regimes, in which a single energy-phase relationship describes both systems. We show how this insight helps to connect recent bodies of theoretical and experimental work in both systems, and conclude by describing a few important differences.</description>

      <title>Metastable Photo-Induced Superconductivity far above $T_{\textrm{c}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the striking discovery of metastable superconductivity in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ at 100K, far above $T_{\textrm{c}}=20K$, we discuss possible mechanisms for long-lived, photo-induced superconductivity. Starting from a model of optically-driven Raman phonons coupled to inter-band electronic transitions, we develop a microscopic mechanism for photo-controlling the pairing interaction. Leveraging this mechanism, we first investigate long-lived superconductivity arising from the thermodynamic metastable trapping of the driven phonon. We then propose an alternative route, where the superconducting gap created by an optical drive leads to a dynamical bottleneck in the equilibration of quasi-particles. We conclude by discussing implications of both scenarios for experiments that can be used to discriminate between them. Our work provides falsifiable explanations for the nanosecond-scale photo-induced superconductivity found in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$, while simultaneously offering a theoretical basis for exploring metastable superconductivity in other quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Tunable Diode Effect in Asymmetric SQUIDs with Topological Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconducting systems in which inversion and time-reversal symmetry are simultaneously broken the critical current for positive and negative current bias can be different. For superconducting systems formed by Josephson junctions (JJs) this effect is termed Josephson diode effect. In this work, we study the Josephson diode effect for a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) formed by a topological JJ with a 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relationship and a topologically trivial JJ. We show how the fractional Josephson effect manifests in the Josephson diode effect with the application of a magnetic field and how tuning properties of the trivial SQUID arm can lead to diode polarity switching. We then investigate the AC response and show that the polarity of the diode effect can be tuned by varying the AC power and discuss differences between the AC diode effect of asymmetric SQUIDs with no topological JJ and SQUIDs in which one JJ is topological.</description>

      <title>Geometrical description and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <title>Investigating Quantum Spin-Textures Using Universal MJ Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a pair of novel universal MJ spintronic models that precisely mirror the complex spin textures observed in spintronic materials. The spin-orbit coupled (SOC) Hamiltonians H_MJ1 and H_MJ2 reveal a range of novel and intriguing spin phenomena by modulating spin-orbit interactions. The Hamiltonian H_MJ1 reshapes the existing paradigm, providing a more robust and versatile framework than the Hamiltonian H_RD, with the potential to catalyze new advancements in the study of quantum materials. H_MJ1 encapsulates two distinct spin textures: a unidirectional, momentum-independent persistent spin texture (PST), and a bidirectional (partial) PST. In contrast Hamiltonian H_MJ2 portrays a spiral spin texture, drawing a conceptual link to the cosmological process of expansion and contraction, mirrored within a two-dimensional quantum framework. We also explore the fundamental aspects of earlier analytical models that underpin the construction of the present MJ spintronic model. The physical interpretations of these models are illustrated graphically, and the emerging spin phenomena resulting from complex SOC are elucidated using a simple vector model.</description>

      <title>Signatures of polarized chiral spin disproportionation in rare earth nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In rare earth nickelates (RENiO$_3$), electron-lattice coupling drives a concurrent metal-to-insulator and bond disproportionation phase transition whose microscopic origin has long been the subject of active debate. Of several proposed mechanisms, here we test the hypothesis that pairs of self-doped ligand holes spatially condense to provide local spin moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to Ni spins. These singlet-like states provide a basis for long-range bond and spiral spin order. Using magnetic resonant X-ray scattering on NdNiO$_3$ thin films, we observe the chiral nature of the spin-disproportionated state, with spin spirals propagating along the crystallographic (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ direction. These spin spirals are found to preferentially couple to X-ray helicity, establishing the presence of a hitherto-unobserved macroscopic chirality. The presence of this chiral magnetic configuration suggests a potential multiferroic coupling between the noncollinear magnetic arrangement and improper ferroelectric behavior as observed in prior studies on NdNiO$_3$ (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ films and RENiO$_3$ single crystals. Experimentally constrained theoretical double-cluster calculations confirm the presence of an energetically stable spin-disproportionated state with Zhang-Rice singlet-like combinations of Ni and ligand moments.</description>
