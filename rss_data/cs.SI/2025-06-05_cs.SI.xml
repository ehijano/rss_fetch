      <title>ExDiff: A Framework for Simulating Diffusion Processes on Complex Networks with Explainable AI Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling diffusion processes in complex networks is critical across domains ranging from epidemiology to information science. Here, we present ExDiff, an interactive and modular computational framework that integrates network simulation, graph neural networks (GNNs), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to model and interpret diffusion dynamics. ExDiff combines classical compartmental models with deep learning techniques to capture both the structural and temporal characteristics of diffusion across diverse network topologies. The framework features dedicated modules for network analysis, neural modeling, simulation, and interpretability, all accessible via an intuitive interface built on Google Colab. Through a case study of the Susceptible Infectious Recovered Vaccinated Dead (SIRVD) model, we demonstrate the capacity to simulate disease spread, evaluate intervention strategies, classify node states, and reveal the structural determinants of contagion through XAI techniques. By unifying simulation and interpretability, ExDiff provides a powerful, flexible, and accessible platform for studying diffusion phenomena in networked systems, enabling both methodological innovation and practical insight.</description>

      <title>GARG-AML against Smurfing: A Scalable and Interpretable Graph-Based Framework for Anti-Money Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods, GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing fraud detection.</description>

      <title>What Drives Team Success? Large-Scale Evidence on the Role of the Team Player Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential in structured, performance-driven environments, from professional organizations to high-stakes competitive settings. As tasks grow more complex, achieving high performance requires not only technical proficiency but also strong interpersonal skills that allow individuals to coordinate effectively within teams. While prior research has identified social skills and familiarity as key drivers of team success, their joint effects -- particularly in temporary teams -- remain underexplored due to data and methodological constraints. To address this gap, we analyze a large-scale panel dataset from the real-time strategy game Age of Empires II, where players are assigned quasi-randomly to temporary teams and must coordinate under dynamic, high-pressure conditions. We isolate individual contributions by comparing observed match outcomes with predictions based on task proficiency. Our findings confirm a robust 'team player effect': certain individuals consistently improve team outcomes beyond what their technical skills predict. This effect is significantly amplified by team familiarity -- teams with prior shared experience benefit more from the presence of such individuals. Moreover, the effect grows with team size, suggesting that social skills become increasingly valuable as coordination demands rise. Our results demonstrate that social skills and familiarity interact in a complementary, rather than additive, way. These findings contribute to the literature on team performance by documenting the strength and structure of the team player effect in a quasi-randomized, high-stakes setting, with implications for teamwork in organizations and labor markets.</description>

      <title>Edge interventions can mitigate demographic and prestige disparities in the Computer Science coauthorship network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social factors such as demographic traits and institutional prestige structure the creation and dissemination of ideas in academic publishing. One place these effects can be observed is in how central or peripheral a researcher is in the coauthorship network. Here we investigate inequities in network centrality in a hand-collected data set of 5,670 U.S.-based faculty employed in Ph.D.-granting Computer Science departments and their DBLP coauthorship connections. We introduce algorithms for combining name- and perception-based demographic labels by maximizing alignment with self-reported demographics from a survey of faculty from our census. We find that women and individuals with minoritized race identities are less central in the computer science coauthorship network, implying worse access to and ability to spread information. Centrality is also highly correlated with prestige, such that faculty in top-ranked departments are at the core and those in low-ranked departments are in the peripheries of the computer science coauthorship network. We show that these disparities can be mitigated using simulated edge interventions, interpreted as facilitated collaborations. Our intervention increases the centrality of target individuals, chosen independently of the network structure, by linking them with researchers from highly ranked institutions. When applied to scholars during their Ph.D., the intervention also improves the predicted rank of their placement institution in the academic job market. This work was guided by an ameliorative approach: uncovering social inequities in order to address them. By targeting scholars for intervention based on institutional prestige, we are able to improve their centrality in the coauthorship network that plays a key role in job placement and longer-term academic success.</description>

      <title>User Altruism in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys) (e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to "boost" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture this behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide the RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to them, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates a low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user her (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare under truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing user altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide an algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are robust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective altruistic strategies on the GoodReads dataset, and an online survey on how real-world users behave altruistically in RecSys. Overall, our findings serve as a proof-of-concept of the reasons why traditional RecSys may incentivize users to form collectives and/or follow altruistic strategies when interacting with them.</description>

      <title>Memory-Driven Bounded Confidence Opinion Dynamics: A Hegselmann-Krause Model Based on Fractional-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects play a crucial role in social interactions and decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel fractional-order bounded confidence opinion dynamics model to characterize the memory effects in system states. Building upon the Hegselmann-Krause framework and fractional-order difference, a comprehensive model is established that captures the persistent influence of historical information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the fundamental properties including convergence and consensus is investigated. The results demonstrate that the proposed model not only maintains favorable convergence and consensus characteristics compared to classical opinion dynamics, but also addresses limitations such as the monotonicity of bounded opinions. This enables a more realistic representation of opinion evolution in real-world scenarios. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodological approaches for understanding opinion formation and evolution, offering both theoretical significance and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Community Aware Temporal Network Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advantages of temporal networks in capturing complex dynamics, such as diffusion and contagion, has led to breakthroughs in real world systems across numerous fields. In the case of human behavior, face-to-face interaction networks enable us to understand the dynamics of how communities emerge and evolve in time through the interactions, which is crucial in fields like epidemics, sociological studies and urban science. However, state-of-the-art datasets suffer from a number of drawbacks, such as short time-span for data collection and a small number of participants. Moreover, concerns arise for the participants' privacy and the data collection costs. Over the past years, many successful algorithms for static networks generation have been proposed, but they often do not tackle the social structure of interactions or their temporal aspect. In this work, we extend a recent network generation approach to capture the evolution of interactions between different communities. Our method labels nodes based on their community affiliation and constructs surrogate networks that reflect the interactions of the original temporal networks between nodes with different labels. This enables the generation of synthetic networks that replicate realistic behaviors. We validate our approach by comparing structural measures between the original and generated networks across multiple face-to-face interaction datasets.</description>

      <title>Catching Stray Balls: Football, fandom, and the impact on digital discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how emotional responses to football matches influence online discourse across digital spaces on Reddit. By analysing millions of posts from dozens of subreddits, it demonstrates that real-world events trigger sentiment shifts that move across communities. It shows that negative sentiment correlates with problematic language; match outcomes directly influence sentiment and posting habits; sentiment can transfer to unrelated communities; and offers insights into the content of this shifting discourse. These findings reveal how digital spaces function not as isolated environments, but as interconnected emotional ecosystems vulnerable to cross-domain contagion triggered by real-world events, contributing to our understanding of the propagation of online toxicity. While football is used as a case-study to computationally measure affective causes and movements, these patterns have implications for understanding online communities broadly.</description>

      <title>Inducing lexicons of in-group language with socio-temporal context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-group language is an important signifier of group dynamics. This paper proposes a novel method for inducing lexicons of in-group language, which incorporates its socio-temporal context. Existing methods for lexicon induction do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social structure of the community. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community at a given point in time. Finally, we present novel insights on in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach.</description>
