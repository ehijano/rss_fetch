      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories, the discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories, have become an important platform for the exploration of non-equilibrium phenomena beyond their original scope in the Standard Model. In particular, recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model including its spectral properties, the structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing, double-logarithmic-in-time, growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to an approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that the entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results thus suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within the numerically accessible system sizes.</description>

      <title>Time-Convolutionless Master Equation Applied to Adiabatic Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In open quantum systems theory, reduced models are invaluable for conceptual understanding and computational efficiency. Adiabatic elimination is a useful model reduction method for systems with separated timescales, where a reduced model is derived by discarding rapidly decaying degrees of freedom. So far, adiabatic elimination has been formulated using a geometric approach, which provides a versatile and general framework. This article introduces a reformulation of adiabatic elimination through the framework of the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation, a widely recognized tool for computing projected time-evolution in open quantum systems. We show that the TCL master equation formulation yields results equivalent to those obtained from the geometric formulation. By applying the TCL master equation formulation to typical examples, we demonstrate a practical methodology for performing adiabatic elimination calculation. This study not only bridges two previously independent approaches, thereby making the adiabatic elimination method accessible to a broader audience, but also enables the analysis of complex cases that are challenging within the geometric formulation. Additionally, it reveals a novel geometric interpretation of the TCL master equation formalism.</description>

      <title>LightSABRE: A Lightweight and Enhanced SABRE Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LightSABRE, a significant enhancement of the SABRE algorithm that advances both runtime efficiency and circuit quality. LightSABRE addresses the increasing demands of modern quantum hardware, which can now accommodate complex scenarios, and circuits with millions of gates. Through iterative development within Qiskit, primarily using the Rust programming language, we have achieved a version of the algorithm in Qiskit 1.2.0 that is approximately 200 times faster than the implementation in Qiskit 0.20.1, which already introduced key improvements like the release valve mechanism. Additionally, when compared to the SABRE algorithm presented in Li et al., LightSABRE delivers an average decrease of 18.9\% in SWAP gate count across the same benchmark circuits. Unlike SABRE, which struggles with scalability and convergence on large circuits, LightSABRE delivers consistently high-quality routing solutions, enabling the efficient execution of large quantum circuits on near-term and future quantum devices. LightSABRE's improvements in speed, scalability, and quality position it as a critical tool for optimizing quantum circuits in the context of evolving quantum hardware and error correction techniques.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based qudit quantum refrigerator with subspace cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to transform a collection of higher-dimensional spin systems from the thermal state with a very high temperature of a local spin-s Hamiltonian to a low-lying energy eigenstate of the same. The procedure utilizes an auxiliary system, interactions between all systems, and appropriate projective measurements of arbitrary rank performed on the auxiliary system. We refer to this process as subspace cooling. The performance of the protocol is assessed by determining the fidelity of the target state with the output one and the success probability of achieving the resulting state. For this analysis, spin-s XXZ and bilinear biquadratic models are employed as the evolving Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that in both scenarios, unit fidelity can be attained after a reasonable number of repeated measurements and a finite amount of evolution time when all the systems are aligned in an open chain, but it fails when the interactions between the spin follow the star configuration. We report that the success probability increases with the rank of the projectors in the measurement for a fixed dimension and that for each dimension, there exists a range of interaction strength and evolution period for which the fidelity gets maximized. Even when some subsystems are in contact with the thermal bath, the method proves to be resistant to decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a method to probe entanglement in a non-accessible continuous basis quantum system. The method is based on our observations about the conservation of entanglement found in a 4 partite system set up constituted by a (qubit-oscillator)-(qubit-oscillator) sub-systems in which each qubit interacts with only one oscillator via a dephasing coupling while no interaction between the qubits nor the oscillators is considered during the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entangled two-photon absorption for the continuous generation of excited state populations in plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) may be a viable technique to continuously drive an excited state population in plasma for high-bandwidth spectroscopy measurements of localized plasma turbulence or impurity density. Classical two-photon absorption commonly requires a high-intensity, pulsed laser, but entangled photons with short entanglement time and high time correlation may allow for ETPA using a lower intensity, continuous-wave laser. Notably, ETPA with non-collinear entangled photon generation allows for cross-beam spatial localization of the absorption or fluorescence signal using a single laser source. Entangled photon generation, the ETPA cross-section, candidate transitions for an Ar-II species, and plans for a proof-of-principle measurement in a helicon plasma are discussed.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Pulse Representation for Diverse Quantum Control Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse-level control of quantum systems is critical for enabling gate implementations, calibration procedures, and Hamiltonian evolution which fundamentally are not supported by the traditional circuit model. This level of control necessitates both efficient generation and representation. In this work, we propose pulselib - a graph-based pulse-level representation. A graph structure, with nodes consisting of parametrized fundamental waveforms, stores all the high-level pulse information while staying flexible for translation into hardware-specific inputs. We motivate pulselib by comparing its feature set and information flow through the pulse layer of the software stack with currently available pulse representations. We describe the architecture of this proposed representation that mimics the abstract syntax tree (AST) model from classical compilation pipelines. Finally, we outline applications like trapped-ion-specific gate and shelving pulse schemes whose constraints and implementation can be written and represented due to pulselib's graph-based architecture.</description>

      <title>Single-photon detectors on arbitrary photonic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting non-classical light is a central requirement for photonics-based quantum technologies. Unrivaled high efficiencies and low dark counts have positioned superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) as the leading detector technology for fiber and integrated photonic applications. However, a central challenge lies in their integration within photonic integrated circuits regardless of material platform or surface topography. Here, we introduce a method based on transfer printing that overcomes these constraints and allows for the integration of SNSPDs onto arbitrary photonic substrates. We prove this by integrating SNSPDs and showing through-waveguide single-photon detection in commercially manufactured silicon and lithium niobate on insulator integrated photonic circuits. Our method eliminates bottlenecks to the integration of high-quality single-photon detectors, turning them into a versatile and accessible building block for scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>SOS decomposition for general Bell inequalities in two qubits systems and its application to quantum randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell non-locality is closely related with device independent quantum randomness. In this paper, we present a kind of sum-of-squares (SOS) decomposition for general Bell inequalities in two qubits systems. By using the obtained SOS decomposition, we can then find the measurement operators associated with the maximal violation of considered Bell inequality. We also practice the SOS decomposition method by considering the (generalized) Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality, the Elegant Bell inequality, the Gisin inequality and the Chained Bell inequality as examples. The corresponding SOS decompositions and the measurement operators that cause the maximum violation values of these Bell inequalities are derived, which are consistent with previous results. We further discuss the device independent quantum randomness by using the SOS decompositions of Bell inequalities. We take the generalized CHSH inequality with the maximally entangled state and the Werner state that attaining the maximal violations as examples. Exact value or lower bound on the maximal guessing probability using the SOS decomposition are obtained. For Werner state, the lower bound can supply a much precise estimation of quantum randomness when $p$ tends to $1$.</description>

      <title>Tight upper bound for the maximal expectation value of the $N$-partite generalized Svetlichny operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite non-locality is not only of fundamental interest but also serves as an important resource for quantum information theory. We consider the $N$-partite scenario and provide an analytical upper bound on the maximal expectation value of the generalized Svetlichny inequality achieved by an arbitrary $N$-qubit system. Furthermore, the constraints on quantum states for which the upper bound is tight are also presented and illustrated by noisy generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Especially, the new techniques proposed to derive the upper bound allow more insights into the structure of the generalized Svetlichny operator and enable us to systematically investigate the relevant properties. As an operational approach, the variation of the correlation matrix we defined makes it more convenient to search for suitable unit vectors that satisfy the tightness conditions. Finally, our results give feasible experimental implementations in detecting the genuine multipartite non-locality and can potentially be applied to other quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Consumable Data via Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical data can be copied and re-used for computation, with adverse consequences economically and in terms of data privacy. Motivated by this, we formulate problems in one-way communication complexity where Alice holds some data and Bob holds $m$ inputs, and he wants to compute $m$ instances of a bipartite relation on Alice's data and each of his inputs. We call this the asymmetric direct sum question for one-way communication. We give a number of examples where the quantum communication complexity of such problems scales polynomially with $m$, while the classical communication complexity depends at most logarithmically on $m$.
  For these examples, data behaves like a consumable resource when the owner stores and transmits it as quantum states. We show an application to a strategic data-selling game, and discuss other potential economic implications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology via Floquet-Engineered Two-axis Twisting and Turn Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core of quantum metrology lies in utilizing entanglement to enhance measurement precision beyond standard quantum limit. Here, we utilize the Floquet-engineered two-axis twisting (TAT) and turn dynamics to generate non-Gaussian states for quantum metrology. By employing both analytically semi-classical and quantum approaches, we find that the desired $N$-particle non-Gaussian state can be produced within a remarkably short time $t_\mathrm{opt}\propto \ln{N}/{N}$, and its quantum Fisher information $F^\mathrm{opt}_\mathrm{Q}\propto N^2$ approaches the Heisenberg limit. Moreover, using the Floquet-engineered anti-TAT-and-turn, we may implement an efficient interaction-based readout protocol to extract the signal encoded in this non-Gaussian state. This Floquet-engineered anti-TAT-and-turn approach offers a viable method to achieve effective time-reversal dynamics for improving measurement precision and resilience against detection noise, all without the need to invert the sign of the nonlinear interaction. This study paves the way for achieving entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology via rapid generation of cat-like states at high particle numbers through continuous Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Relations for Quantum Testers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is one of the features of quantum theory. Fine-grained uncertainty relations (FGURs) are a contemporary interpretation of this principle. Each FGUR is derived from a scenario where multiple measurements of a quantum state are stochastically performed. While state measurements are fundamental, measuring quantum processes, namely, completely positive and trace preserving maps, is also crucial both theoretically and practically. These measurements are mathematically characterized by quantum testers. In this study, we develop FGURs in terms of quantum testers. Because state preparation is a type of quantum process, our framework encompasses the conventional case as a special instance. The generalized FGURs' bounds are typically challenging to compute. Thus, we also provide estimates for these bounds. Specifically, we explore quantum testers involving maximally entangled states in detail. Consequently, some FGURs for quantum testers are derived as explicit forms for specific settings.</description>

      <title>Simulating a quasiparticle on a quantum device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational approach to explore quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems, motivated by the potential in leveraging near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum devices for quantum state preparation. By exploiting translation invariance and potentially other abelian symmetries of the many-body Hamiltonian, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach to construct spatially localized quasiparticle states that encode information on the whole excited band, allowing us to achieve quantum parallelism. We benchmark the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations performed on the one-dimension transverse field Ising chain. We show that VQE can capture both the magnon quasiparticles of the paramagnetic phase, and the topologically non-trivial domain wall excitations in the ferromagnetic regime. We show that the localized quasiparticle states constructed with VQE contain accessible information on the full band of quasiparticles, and provide valuable insight into the way interactions renormalize the bare spin flip or domain wall excitations of the simple, trivially solvable limits of the model. These results serve as important theoretical input towards utilizing quantum simulators to directly access the quasiparticles of strongly interacting quantum systems, as well as to gain insight into crucial experimentally measured properties directly determined by the nature of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust High-Precision Atomic Gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic gravimeters are the most accurate sensors for measuring gravity, however, a significant challenge is how to achieve high precision even in the presence of noises. Here, we develop a protocol for achieving robust high-precision atomic gravimetry based upon adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation. Our protocol incorporates a sequence of interferometry measurements taken with short to long interrogation times and offers several key advantages. Firstly, it enables a high dynamic range without the need to scan multiple fringes for pre-estimation, making it more efficient than the conventional frequentist method. Secondly, it enhances robustness against noises, allowing for a significant measurement precision improvement in noisy environments. The enhancement can be more than $5$ times for a transportable gravimeter and up to an order of magnitude for a state-of-the-art fountain gravimeter. Notably, by optimizing the interferometry sequence, our approach can improve the scaling of the measurement precision ($\Delta g_{est}$) versus the total interrogation time ($\tilde{T}$) to $\Delta g_{est} \propto \tilde{T}^{-2}$ or even better, in contrast to the conventional one $\Delta g_{est} \propto \tilde{T}^{-0.5}$. Our approach offers superior precision, increased dynamic range, and enhanced robustness, making it highly promising for a range of practical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A Simple Scheme for Preparation of the Approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill States with Random Walk Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) coding is proven to be a good candidate for encoding a qubit on continuous variables (CV) since it is robust under random-shift disturbance. Its preparation in optical systems, however, is challenging to realize in nowadays state-of-the-art experiments. In this article, we propose a simple optical setup for preparing the approximate GKP states by employing a random walk mechanism. We demonstrate this idea by considering the encoding on the transverse position of a single-mode pulse laser. We also discuss generalization and translation to other types of physical CV systems.</description>

      <title>Study of quantum phase transition and entanglement in coupled top systems with standard and nonstandard symmetries under Floquet formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an effective time-independent Hamiltonian of a coupled kicked-top (CKT) system derived using the Van Vleck-based perturbation theory at the high-frequency driving limit under Floquet formalism. The effective Hamiltonian is a non-integrable system due to the presence of nonlinear torsional terms in the individual top and also due to the coupling between two tops. Here, we study classical and quantum versions of this coupled top system for torsion-free and nonzero torsion cases. The former model is well-known in the literature as the Feingold-Peres (FP) model. At the quantum limit, depending on the system parameters, both systems satisfy BDI, or chiral orthogonal symmetry class, which is one of the recently proposed nonstandard symmetry classes. We study the role of underlying symmetry on the entanglement between the two tops. Moreover, we also investigate the interrelations among quantum phase transitions, entanglement between the tops, and the stability of the underlying classical dynamics for the system with torsion-free and nonzero torsion cases.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis for high-dimensional Bell-state quantum illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) is an entanglement-based protocol for improving lidar/radar detection of unresolved targets beyond what a classical lidar/radar of the same average transmitted energy can do. Originally proposed by Lloyd as a discrete-variable quantum lidar, it was soon shown that his proposal offered no quantum advantage over its best classical competitor. Continuous-variable, specifically Gaussian-state, QI has been shown to offer true quantum advantage, both in theory and in table-top experiments. Moreover, despite its considerable drawbacks, the microwave version of Gaussian-state QI continues to attract research attention. Recently, however, Pannu et al. (arXiv:2407.08005 [quant-ph]) have: (1) combined the entangled state from Lloyd's QI with the channel models from Gaussian-state QI; (2) proposed a new positive operator-valued measurement for that composite setup; and (3) showed that, unlike Gaussian-state QI, their QI achieves the Nair-Gu lower bound on QI target-detection error probability at all noise brightnesses. Pannu~\emph{et al}.'s analysis was asymptotic, i.e., it presumed infinite-dimensional entanglement. This paper works out the finite-dimensional performance of Pannu et al.'s QI. It shows that there is a threshold value for the entangled-state dimensionality below which there is no quantum advantage, and above which the Nair-Gu bound is approached asymptotically. Moreover, in high-brightness noise, with both systems operating 1 dB below the Nair-Gu bound's error-probability exponent, Pannu et al.'s QI requires much higher entangled-state dimensionality than does Gaussian-state QI to achieve useful error probabilities.</description>

      <title>CompressedMediQ: Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Pipeline for High-Dimentional Neuroimaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CompressedMediQ, a novel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline specifically developed to address the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional multi-class neuroimaging data analysis. Standard neuroimaging datasets, such as 4D MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia (NIFD), present significant hurdles due to their vast size and complexity. CompressedMediQ integrates classical high-performance computing (HPC) nodes for advanced MRI pre-processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-PCA-based feature extraction and reduction, addressing the limited-qubit availability for quantum data encoding in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. This is followed by Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classification. By utilizing quantum kernel methods, the pipeline optimizes feature mapping and classification, enhancing data separability and outperforming traditional neuroimaging analysis techniques. Experimental results highlight the pipeline's superior accuracy in dementia staging, validating the practical use of quantum machine learning in clinical diagnostics. Despite the limitations of NISQ devices, this proof-of-concept demonstrates the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced learning, paving the way for scalable and precise diagnostic tools in healthcare and signal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, while being prone to experimental fabrication, is an extremely challenging task. In this Letter we propose a deceptively simple quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, saturating the quantum speed limit. It consists of two harmonic oscillators (the charger and the battery), coupled during the non-equilibrium charging dynamics by a non-linear interaction. We first present the model, then certify the genuine quantum advantage, and finally briefly discuss how the battery can be fabricated through the use of superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Nano-mirror induced three-level quantum heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model that integrates a three-level $\Lambda$-type quantum heat engine with a vibrating nanomirror, where the connection is established via a laser field. In the presence of both hot and cold thermal photonic baths, the atom interacts with the laser field, generating photons as output, mimicking the operation of a heat engine driven by nanomirror vibrations. Using a semiclassical approach, we observe that the classical output or gain of the quantum heat engine is maximized as the photon distribution in the baths increases, provided that the coupling strength between the nanomirror and the engine is minimized. The model suggests that a greater temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs results in a more effective positive gain in the output. Thermodynamic analysis of the proposed model indicates that the total energy absorbed by the atomic system is equal to the energy released by the system, thus satisfying the first law of thermodynamics. The efficiency of the proposed engine decreases with an increasing photon distribution number in the hot reservoir, with a more pronounced decrease observed at higher values of atom-mirror coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Optimal discrimination of quantum sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key concept of quantum information theory is that accessing information encoded in a quantum system requires us to discriminate between several possible states the system could be in. A natural generalization of this problem, namely, quantum sequence discrimination, appears in various quantum information processing tasks, the objective being to determine the state of a finite sequence of quantum states. Since such a sequence is a composite quantum system, the fundamental question is whether an optimal measurement is local, i.e., comprising measurements on the individual members, or collective, i.e. requiring joint measurement(s). In some known instances of this problem, the optimal measurement is local, whereas in others, it is collective. But, so far, a definite prescription based solely on the problem description has been lacking. In this paper, we prove that if the members of a given sequence are drawn secretly and independently from an ensemble or even from different ensembles, the optimum success probability is achievable by fixed local measurements on the individual members of the sequence, and no collective measurement is necessary. This holds for both minimum-error and unambiguous state discrimination paradigms.</description>

      <title>Phase space measures of information flow in open systems: A quantum and classical perspective of non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange of information between an open quantum system and its environment, especially the backflow of information from the environment to the open system associated with quantum notions of non-Markovianity, is a widely discussed topic for years now. This information flow can be quantified by means of the trace distance of pairs of quantum states which provides a measure for the distinguishability of the states. The same idea can also be used to characterize the information flow in classical open systems through a suitable distance measure for their probability distributions on phase space. Here, we investigate the connection between the trace distance based quantum measure and the Kolmogorov distance for differently ordered quasi-probability distributions on phase space. In particular, we show that for any pair of quantum states one can find a unique quasi-probability distribution for which the Kolmogorov distance coincides with the trace distance. We further study the quantum-to-classical transition of the distance measures. Employing the Caldeira-Legget model of quantum Brownian motion as a prototypical example, numerical simulations indicate a particularly rapid convergence of the Kolmogorov distance of the Wigner functions to the trace distance in the classical uncertainty limit, which establishes the Wigner function distance as an optimal tool for measuring semi-classical information backflow and for quantifying non-Markovianity in open continuous variable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable and interpretable quantum natural language processing: an implementation on trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first implementation of text-level quantum natural language processing, a field where quantum computing and AI have found a fruitful intersection. We focus on the QDisCoCirc model, which is underpinned by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behaviour of the whole can be understood in terms of the behaviour of parts, and the way they are put together. Interpretability is crucial for understanding the unwanted behaviours of AI. By leveraging the compositional structure in the model's architecture, we introduce a novel setup which enables 'compositional generalisation': we classically train components which are then composed to generate larger test instances, the evaluation of which asymptotically requires a quantum computer. Another key advantage of our approach is that it bypasses the trainability challenges arising in quantum machine learning. The main task that we consider is the model-native task of question-answering, and we handcraft toy scale data that serves as a proving ground. We demonstrate an experiment on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum processor, which constitutes the first proof of concept implementation of scalable compositional QNLP. We also provide resource estimates for classically simulating the model. The compositional structure allows us to inspect and interpret the word embeddings the model learns for each word, as well as the way in which they interact. This improves our understanding of how it tackles the question-answering task. As an initial comparison with classical baselines, we considered transformer and LSTM models, as well as GPT-4, none of which succeeded at compositional generalisation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Benchpress, a benchmarking suite for evaluating the performance and range of functionality of multiple quantum computing software development kits. This suite consists of a collection of over $1000$ tests measuring key performance metrics for a wide variety of operations on quantum circuits comprised of up to $930$ qubits and $\mathcal{O}(10^{6})$ two-qubit gates, as well as an execution framework for running the tests over multiple quantum software packages in a unified manner. We give a detailed overview of the benchmark suite, its methodology, and generate representative results over seven different quantum software packages. The flexibility of the Benchpress framework allows for benchmarking that not only keeps pace with quantum hardware improvements but can preemptively gauge the quantum circuit processing costs of future device architectures. Being open-source, Benchpress ensures the transparency and verification of performance claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence is one of the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics and also acts as a valuable resource for a variety of practical applications, which includes quantum computing and quantum information processing. Evaluating the dilution of coherence is a basic problem in the framework of resource theory. We consider the coherence dilution problem in the one-shot scenario. We find a semidefinite program of one-shot coherence dilution of pure state under maximally incoherent operation. We further give a similar but not semidefinite program form under dephasing-covariant incoherent operation. Moreover, we prove that the known lower bound of the one-shot dilution is strict. Our numerical experiment clearly demonstrates that the maximally incoherent operation and dephasing-covariant incoherent operation have different power in the coherence dilution.</description>

      <title>Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using an Offset-Charge-Sensitive Transmon Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using an offset-charge-sensitive transmon coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</description>

      <title>Shadow Quantum Linear Solver: A Resource Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Linear Systems of Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the solution to linear systems is at the heart of many applications in science and technology. Over the years a number of algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem on a digital quantum device, yet most of these are too demanding to be applied to the current noisy hardware. In this work, an original algorithmic procedure to solve the Quantum Linear System Problem (QLSP) is presented, which combines ideas from Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) and the framework of classical shadows. The result is the Shadow Quantum Linear Solver (SQLS), a quantum algorithm solving the QLSP avoiding the need for large controlled unitaries, requiring a number of qubits that is logarithmic in the system size. In particular, our heuristics show an exponential advantage of the SQLS in circuit execution per cost function evaluation when compared to other notorious variational approaches to solving linear systems of equations. We test the convergence of the SQLS on a number of linear systems, and results highlight how the theoretical bounds on the number of resources used by the SQLS are conservative. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a physical problem of practical relevance, by leveraging decomposition theorems from linear algebra to solve the discretized Laplace Equation in a 2D grid for the first time using a hybrid quantum algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose boson sampling from a system of coupled photons and Bose-Einstein condensed atoms placed inside a multi-mode cavity as a simulation process testing quantum advantage of quantum systems over classical computers. Consider a two-level atomic transition far-detuned from photon frequency. An atom-photon scattering and interatomic collisions provide interaction creating quasiparticles and exciting atoms, photons into squeezed entangled states orthogonal, respectively, to the atomic condensate and classical field driving the two-level transition. We find a joint probability distribution of atom and photon numbers within a quasi-equilibrium model via a hafnian of an extended covariance matrix. It shows a sampling statistics that is #P-hard for computing even if only photon numbers are sampled. Merging cavity-QED and quantum-gas technologies into hybrid boson sampling setup has the potential to overcome limitations of separate, photon or atom, sampling schemes and reveal quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Control of solid-state nuclear spin qubits using an electron spin-1/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum registers consisting of optically active electron spins with nearby nuclear spins are promising building blocks for future quantum technologies. For electron spin-1 registers, dynamical decoupling (DD) quantum gates have been developed that enable the precise control of multiple nuclear spin qubits. However, for the important class of electron spin-1/2 systems, this control method suffers from intrinsic selectivity limitations, resulting in reduced nuclear spin gate fidelities. Here we demonstrate improved control of single nuclear spins by an electron spin-1/2 using Dynamically Decoupled Radio Frequency (DDRF) gates. We make use of the electron spin-1/2 of a diamond tin-vacancy center, showing high-fidelity single-qubit gates, single-shot readout, and spin coherence beyond a millisecond. The DD control is used as a benchmark to observe and control a single carbon-13 nuclear spin. Using the DDRF control method, we demonstrate improved control on that spin. In addition, we find and control an additional nuclear spin that is insensitive to the DD control method. Using these DDRF gates, we show entanglement between the electron and the nuclear spin with 72(3)% state fidelity. Our extensive simulations indicate that DDRF gate fidelities well in excess are feasible. Finally, we employ time-resolved photon detection during readout to quantify the hyperfine coupling for the electron's optically excited state.

      <title>Entanglement and Coherence Dynamics in Photonic Quantum Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristive systems exhibit dynamics that depend on their past states, making them useful as memory units. Due to their functional resemblance to real synapses, memristors can also constitute the building blocks of neural networks for a variety of tasks. Recently, quantum memristor models have been proposed and notably, a photonic quantum memristor (PQM) has been experimentally proven. In this work, we explore and characterize various quantum properties that emerge from this specific model of PQM. Firstly, we find that a single PQM displays memristive dynamics on its quantum coherence. Secondly, we show that a network made of two independent PQMs can manifest memory effects on the dynamics of both entanglement and coherence of correlated photons traveling through the network, regardless of their distance. Additionally, we build and run a circuit-model of the PQM on a real qubit-based quantum computer (IBM-Q), showing that: (i) this system can effectively be used for non-linear quantum computing under specific conditions, and (ii) digital quantum simulations can reproduce the dynamics of a memristive quantum system in a non-Markovian regime.</description>

      <title>A Fiber-pigtailed Quantum Dot Device Generating Indistinguishable Photons at GHz Clock-rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum light sources based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are increasingly employed in photonic quantum information applications. Especially when moving towards real-world scenarios outside shielded lab environments, the efficient and robust coupling of nanophotonic devices to single-mode optical fibers offers substantial advantage by enabling "plug-and-play" operation. In this work we present a fiber-pigtailed cavity-enhanced source of flying qubits emitting single indistinguishable photons at clock-rates exceeding 1 GHz. This is achieved by employing a fully deterministic technique for fiber-pigtailing optimized QD-devices based on hybrid circular Bragg grating (hCBG) micro-cavities. The fabricated fiber-pigtailed hCBGs feature radiative emission lifetimes of $&lt;$80 ps, corresponding to a Purcell factor of $\sim$9, a suppression of multiphoton emission events with $g^{(2)}$(0) $&lt;$1%, a photon-indistinguishability &gt;80% and a measured single-photon coupling efficiency of 53% in a high numerical aperture single-mode fiber, corresponding to 1.2 Megaclicks per second at the single-photon detectors. Our results show that fiber-pigtailed quantum light sources based on hCBG cavities are a prime candidate for applications of quantum information science.</description>

      <title>The Better Solution Probability Metric: Optimizing QAOA to Outperform its Warm-Start Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical simulation investigation of the Warm-Start Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as proposed by Tate et al. [1], focusing on its application to 3-regular Max-Cut problems. Our study demonstrates that Warm-Start QAOA consistently outperforms theoretical lower bounds on approximation ratios across various tilt angles, highlighting its potential in practical scenarios beyond worst-case predictions. Despite these improvements, Warm-Start QAOA with traditional parameters optimized for expectation value does not exceed the performance of the initial classical solution. To address this, we introduce an alternative parameter optimization objective, the Better Solution Probability (BSP) metric. Our results show that BSP-optimized Warm-Start QAOA identifies solutions at non-trivial tilt angles that are better than even the best classically found warm-start solutions with non-vanishing probabilities. These findings underscore the importance of both theoretical and empirical analyses in refining QAOA and exploring its potential for quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Boson sampling with self-generation of squeezing via interaction of photons and atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a novel scheme for generating multimode squeezed states for the boson sampling implementation. The idea is to replace a commonly used linear interferometer by a multimode resonator containing a passive optical element consisting of two-level atoms dispersively interacting with photons and self-generating a squeezed compound state of both bosons -- photons and atoms. The suggested scheme does not need (a) on-demand external sources of photons in squeezed or Fock quantum states and (b) numerous interchannel couplers which introduce phase noise and losses that prevent scaling up the system and achieving quantum advantage. The idea is illustrated by a setup based on a Bose-Einstein-condensed gas confined in a multimode resonator, one of whose optical modes is in the classical coherent regime. The joint probability distribution of photon and/or noncondensed atom numbers is calculated via a matrix hafnian that, for certain parameters of the system, is hardly to be effectively calculated by classical computers. Such experiments are at reach via existing cavity-QED and cold-gas technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, financial analysts have been trying to develop models to predict the movement of a stock price index. The task becomes challenging in vague economic, social, and political situations like in Pakistan. In this study, we employed efficient models of machine learning such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) to predict the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100 index by taking monthly data of twenty-six economic, social, political, and administrative indicators from February 2004 to December 2020. The comparative results of LSTM and QLSTM predicted values of the KSE 100 index with the actual values suggested QLSTM a potential technique to predict stock market trends.</description>

      <title>Towards complexity of primary-deformed Virasoro circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fubini-Study metric is a central element of information geometry. We explore the role played by information geometry for determining the circuit complexity of Virasoro circuits and their deformations. To this effect, we study unitary quantum circuits generated by the Virasoro algebra and Fourier modes of a primary operator. Such primary-deformed Virasoro circuits can be realized in two-dimensional conformal field theories, where they provide models of inhomogeneous global quenches. We consider a cost function induced by the Fubini-Study metric and provide a universal expression for its time-evolution to quadratic order in the primary deformation for general source profiles. For circuits generated by the Virasoro zero mode and a primary, we obtain a non-zero cost only if spatial inhomogeneities are sufficiently large. In this case, we find that the cost saturates when the source becomes time independent. The exact saturation value is determined by the history of the source profile. As a byproduct, returning to undeformed circuits, we relate the Fubini-Study metric to the K\"ahler metric on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalized Statistical Mechanics with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational algorithm based on Matrix Product States that is trained by minimizing a generalized free energy defined using Tsallis entropy instead of the standard Gibbs entropy. As a result, our model can generate the probability distributions associated with generalized statistical mechanics. The resulting model can be efficiently trained, since the resulting free energy and its gradient can be calculated exactly through tensor network contractions, as opposed to standard methods which require estimating the Gibbs entropy by sampling. We devise a variational annealing scheme by ramping up the inverse temperature, which allows us to train the model while avoiding getting trapped in local minima. We show the validity of our approach in Ising spin-glass problems by comparing it to exact numerical results and quasi-exact analytical approximations. Our work opens up new possibilities for studying generalized statistical physics and solving combinatorial optimization problems with tensor networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of Unitary Quantum Walks on arbitrary graphs, parameterized by a family of scattering matrices. These Scattering Quantum Walks model the discrete dynamics of a system on the edges of the graph, with a scattering process at each vertex governed by the scattering matrix assigned to it. We show that Scattering Quantum Walks encompass several known Quantum Walks. Additionally, we introduce two classes of Open Scattering Quantum Walks on arbitrary graphs, also parameterized by scattering matrices: one class defined on the edges and the other on the vertices of the graph. We show that these walks give rise to proper Quantum Channels and describe their main spectral and dynamical properties, relating them to naturally associated classical Markov chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of stable bound states between pairs of ultracold diatomic molecules with the aid of a static electric field and 1D harmonic confinement. We focus on collisions of NaK-NaK identical fermions, for which we find that currently achievable experimental parameters allow the observation of these confinement-induced field-linked bound states as scattering resonances. The bound state is highly stable with lifetimes estimated to be tens of seconds long. With the diatomic molecules bound at distances a fraction of the dipolar length scale, these complexes allow for explorations of polyatomic chemistry and Fermi gas superfluid pairing.</description>

Abstract: Investigating localization properties of interacting disordered systems plays a crucial role in understanding thermalization and its absence in closed quantum systems. However, simulating such systems on classical computers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a method to realize S = 1/2 and S = 1 quantum spin models with quasiperiodic interaction using Rydberg atoms by utilizing the high tunability of their spatial position. We also perform numerical calculations and show that these models host a many-body critical regime, which differs from the ergodic and many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Time-domain braiding of anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrary to fermions and bosons, anyons are quasiparticles that keep a robust memory of particle exchanges via a braiding phase factor. This provides them with unique dynamical properties so far unexplored. When an anyon excitation is emitted toward a quantum point contact (QPC) in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid, this memory translates into tunneling events that may occur long after the anyon excitation has exited the QPC. Here, we use triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a $\nu= 1/3$ FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observe that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge state dynamics. This contrasts with the electron behavior where braiding is absent and the tunneling timescale is set by the temporal width of the generated electron pulses. Our experiment introduces time-domain measurements for characterizing the braiding phase and scaling dimension of anyons.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry restoration in the Heisenberg spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry is an observable independent tool to investigate the relaxation of quantum many body systems through the restoration of an initially broken symmetry of the dynamics. In this paper we use this to investigate the effects of interactions on quantum relaxation in a paradigmatic integrable model. Specifically, we study the dynamical restoration of the $U(1)$ symmetry corresponding to rotations about the $z$-axis in the XXZ model quenched from a tilted ferromagnetic state. We find two distinct patterns of behaviour depending upon the interaction regime of the model. In the gapless regime, at roots of unity, we find that the symmetry restoration is predominantly carried out by bound states of spinons of maximal length. The velocity of these bound states is suppressed as the anisotropy is decreased towards the isotropic point leading to slower symmetry restoration. By varying the initial tilt angle, one sees that symmetry restoration is slower for an initally smaller tilt angle, signifying the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect. In the gapped regime however, spin transport for non maximally tilted states, is dominated by smaller bound states with longer bound states becoming frozen. This leads to a much longer time scales for restoration compared to the gapless regime. In addition, the quantum Mpemba effect is absent in the gapped regime.</description>

      <title>Variational Calculation of the Hyperfine Stark Effect in Atomic $^{87}$Rb, $^{133}$Cs, and $^{169}$Tm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electronically variational approach to the calculation of atomic hyperfine structure transition energies under the influence of static external electric fields is presented. The method avoids the calculation of intermediate atomic states entirely and requires only the wavefunctions of the electronic states involved in the respective hyperfine levels. These wavefunctions are obtained through relativistic general-excitation-rank configuration interaction theory. The method also enables for calculations on atoms with the most complicated of shell structures.
  The initial applications include $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs where very good agreement of the approach with literature results is established. For $^{169}$Tm that is used in the development of atomic clocks the differential static electric dipole polarizability between ground levels $J=\frac{7}{2}$ and $J=\frac{5}{2}$ is calculated to be $\Delta\alpha = -0.23 \pm 0.11$ \au The hyperfine Stark coefficient for the hyperfine levels belonging to the ground term with $J=\frac{7}{2}$ is found to be $k = (1.3 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-13}$ [Hz/((V/m)$^2$)]. This coefficient is several orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding coefficients in $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum spin van der Pol (vdP) oscillator as a prototypical model of quantum spin-based limit-cycle oscillators, which coincides with the quantum optical vdP oscillator in the high-spin limit. The system is described as a noisy limit-cycle oscillator in the semiclassical regime at large spin numbers, exhibiting frequency entrainment to a periodic drive. Even in the smallest spin-1 case, mutual synchronization, Arnold tongues, and entanglement tongues in two dissipatively coupled oscillators, and collective synchronization in all-to-all coupled oscillators are clearly observed. The proposed quantum spin vdP oscillator will provide a useful platform for analyzing quantum spin synchronization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pseudomode Representation and Complexity of Quantum Impurity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium fermionic quantum impurity models (QIM), describing a small interacting system coupled to a continuous fermionic bath, play an important role in condensed matter physics. Solving such models is a computationally demanding task, and a variety of computational approaches are based on finding approximate representations of the bath by a finite number of modes. In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding efficient bath representations as that of approximating a kernel of the bath's Feynman-Vernon influence functional by a sum of complex exponentials, with each term defining a fermionic pseudomode. Under mild assumptions on the analytic properties of the bath spectral density, we provide an analytic construction of pseudomodes, and prove that their number scales polylogarithmically with the maximum evolution time $T$ and the approximation error $\varepsilon$. We then demonstrate that the number of pseudomodes can be significantly reduced by an interpolative matrix decomposition (ID). Furthermore, we present a complementary approach, based on constructing rational approximations of the bath's spectral density using the ``AAA'' algorithm, followed by compression with ID. The combination of two approaches yields a pseudomode count scaling as $N_\text{ID} \sim \log(T)\log(1/\varepsilon)$, and the agreement between the two approches suggests that the result is close to optimal. Finally, to relate our findings to QIM, we derive an explicit Liouvillian that describes the time evolution of the combined impurity-pseudomodes system. These results establish bounds on the computational resources required for solving out-of-equilibrium QIMs, providing an efficient starting point for tensor-network methods for QIMs.</description>

      <title>Towards Precise 3D Quantum Control of a Levitated Dipolar Scatterer using Spatial Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An essential requirement for universal quantum control of the centre-of-mass motion of levitated objects is the development of a precise readout of all three translational degrees of freedom. Improving that precision presents one key challenge: collecting all the information on the object's position, encoded in the scattered light, equivalent to minimising the measurement imprecision. Here, we propose a new detection technique based on spatial mode decomposition, which addresses this problem using a simple integrated setup, where all of the light back-scattered from a levitated nanoparticle couples into a spatial mode sorter. We observe that each mode of the sorter pairs predominantly to the in-elastically scattered field generated by the object's motion along a particular spatial axis. This results in each translational degree of freedom being selectively encoded in the amplitude of orthogonal information channels. Using this approach, we report measurement efficiencies ($\eta_{\mathrm{tot}}^x$, $\eta_{\mathrm{tot}}^y$, $\eta_{\mathrm{tot}}^z$) = (0.17, 0.15, 0.30), implying that our technique is capable of reaching the 3D quantum ground state.</description>

      <title>Insights from the exact analytical solution of periodically driven transverse field Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact analytical expression, at stroboscopic intervals, for the time-dependent wave function of a class of integrable quantum many-body systems, driven by the periodic delta-kick protocol. To investigate long-time dynamics, we use the wave-function to obtain an exact analytical expression for the expectation value of defect density, magnetization, residual energy, fidelity, and correlation function after the $n$th drive cycle. Periodically driven integrable closed quantum systems absorb energy, and the long-time universal dynamics are described by the periodic generalized Gibbs ensemble(GGE). We demonstrate that the expectation values of all observables are divided into two parts: one highly oscillatory term that depends on the drive cycle $n$, and the rest of the terms are independent of it. Typically, the $n$-independent part constitutes the saturation at large $n$ and periodic GGE. The contribution from the highly oscillatory term vanishes in large $n$.</description>

      <title>Turing Video-based Cognitive Tests to Handle Entangled Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have proved in both human-based and computer-based tests that natural concepts generally `entangle' when they combine to form complex sentences, violating the rules of classical compositional semantics. In this article, we present the results of an innovative video-based cognitive test on a specific conceptual combination, which significantly violates the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt version of Bell's inequalities (`CHSH inequality'). We also show that collected data can be faithfully modelled within a quantum-theoretic framework elaborated by ourselves and a `strong form of entanglement' occurs between the component concepts. While the video-based test confirms previous empirical results on entanglement in human cognition, our ground-breaking empirical approach surpasses language barriers and eliminates the need for prior knowledge, enabling universal accessibility. Finally, this transformative methodology allows one to unravel the underlying connections that drive our perception of reality. As a matter of fact, we provide a novel explanation for the appearance of entanglement in both physics and cognitive realms.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning for denoising quasiparticle interference data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy is an important tool for the study of both real-space and momentum-space electronic structure of correlated electron systems. However, such measurements often yield noisy data. Machine learning provides techniques to reduce the noise in post-processing, but traditionally requires noiseless examples which are unavailable for scientific experiments. In this work we adapt the unsupervised Noise2Noise and self-supervised Noise2Self algorithms, which allow for denoising without clean examples, to denoise quasiparticle interference data. We first apply the techniques on simulated data, and demonstrate that we are able to reduce the noise while preserving finer details, all while outperforming more traditional denoising techniques. We then apply the Noise2Self technique to experimental data from an overdoped cuprate ((Pb,Bi)$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$) sample. Denoising enhances the clarity of quasiparticle interference patterns, and helps to obtain a precise extraction of electronic structure parameters. Self-supervised denoising is a promising tool for denoising quasiparticle interference data, facilitating deeper insights into the physics of complex materials.</description>

Abstract: Response to a poll can be manipulated by means of a series of leading questions. We show that such phenomena cannot be explained by use of classical probability theory, whereas quantum probability theory admits a possibility of offering an explanation. Admissible transformation rules in quantum probability, however, do impose some constraints on the modelling of cognitive behaviour, which are highlighted here. Focusing on a recent poll conducted by Ipsos on a set of questions posed by Sir Humphrey Appleby in an episode of the British political satire \textit{Yes, Prime Minister}, we show that the resulting data cannot be explained quite so simply using quantum rules, although it seems not impossible.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we highlight the structure and main properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of the model is the existence of infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it to approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$ symmetry, where $G$ is a generic finite rank internal symmetry for each subsystem that is entangled to the rest of the Universe by the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. In addition to parameters characterizing representation of $G$ by subsystems, their states depend on 4 continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems, and the forth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a quantum clock. They introduce a relative dynamics for subsystem formulated by a symmetry invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D parameter space. At lowest quantum order it is a Yang-Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Thus, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Apparently this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as the curvature of the space of average values of aforementioned parameters. We prove that emergent spacetime has a Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>The connection of polaritonic chemistry with the physics of a spin glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed electronic structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the iconic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability in the dressed electronic structure (spontaneous replica symmetry breaking), which could provide the long-sought seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. This mapping paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as frustration, aging dynamics, excess of thermal fluctuations, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the mapping also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems and it suggests novel theoretical directions such as polarization glasses with explicitly time-dependent order parameter functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.01882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging from the superposition principle, the resource theory of coherence plays a crucial role in many information-processing tasks. Recently, a generalization to this resource theory was investigated with respect to arbitrary positive operator valued measurement (POVM) based on Naimark's dilation theorem. Here, we introduce the notion of Block Incoherent Operations (BIO), Strictly Block Incoherent Operations (SBIO) and Physically Block Incoherent Operations (PBIO) and provide an analytical expression for Kraus operators of these operations to have a better understanding of the resource theory of block coherence which in turn gives a more clear picture of POVM based resource theory of coherence. A dilation theorem corresponding to SBIO has been introduced to enlighten the proper physical interpretation of this operation. These free operations will be helpful in finding out the conditions of state transformations and could be implemented in various protocols. For a transparent view of this resource theory, we have successfully introduced the concept of state transformation under SBIO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal that the mechanism driving the manifestation of wave effects is fundamentally embedded within quantum field theory. These wave effects become real when conservation laws are satisfied, allowing quantum effects to fully materialize, and remain virtual when these laws are violated. The materialization process is governed by external sources that supply conserved quantities, and by virtual particles that carry these quantities. For example, a photon in a region of constructive and destructive interference can form either a real or virtual interference pattern, contingent on the availability of these conserved quantities. Our findings also resolve a longstanding paradox in an experiment that challenges the principle of complementarity. Furthermore, we predict that low energy galactic neutrinos, constrained by the limited range of vector boson interactions, behave as a classical ideal gas, a prediction we believe is experimentally testable. These insights not only address fundamental questions in quantum mechanics but also open new avenues for future exploration.</description>

Abstract: In order to substantiate claims of quantum computational advantage, it is crucial to develop efficient methods for validating the experimental data. We propose a test of the correct functioning of a boson sampler with single-photon inputs that is based on how photons distribute among partitions of the output modes. Our method is versatile and encompasses previous validation tests based on bunching phenomena, marginal distributions, and even some suppression laws. We show via theoretical arguments and numerical simulations that binned-mode photon number distributions can be used in practical scenarios to efficiently distinguish ideal boson samplers from those affected by realistic imperfections, especially partial distinguishability of the photons.</description>

      <title>Spatial and temporal characteristics of spontaneous parametric down-conversion with varying focal planes of interacting beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a widely used process to prepare entangled photon pairs. In SPDC, a second-order nonlinear crystal is pumped by a coherent laser beam to generate photon pairs. The photon pairs are usually detected by single-mode fibers (SMF), where only photons in a Gaussian mode can be collected. The collection modes possess typical Gaussian parameters, namely a beam waist and a focal plane position. The collection efficiency of photons highly depends on the choice of both parameters. The exact focal plane position of the pump beam relative to those of the detection modes is difficult to determine in a real experiment. Usually, theoretical and experimental studies assume that the focal plane positions of the pump and the generated beams are positioned in the center of the crystal. The displacement of beam focal planes can lead to deviations from expected results and the coupling efficiency into SMF can increase or decrease. In this work, we consider variable positions of focal planes and investigate how shifts of these focal planes influence the spatial and temporal properties of photon pairs. We present SPDC arrangements, in which the knowledge of the exact position of the focal planes is essential, as well as scenarios, where focal plane displacements do not contribute significantly to experimental outcomes. These findings are of particular interest for achieving higher efficiency in SPDC experiments.</description>

      <title>Error mitigation, optimization, and extrapolation on a trapped ion testbed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) trapped-ion devices are subject to errors which can significantly impact the accuracy of calculations if left unchecked. A form of error mitigation called zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) can decrease an algorithm's sensitivity to these errors without increasing the number of required qubits. Here, we explore different methods for integrating this error mitigation technique into the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for calculating the ground state of the HeH+ molecule at 0.8 Angstrom in the presence of realistic noise. Using the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT) trapped-ion device, we test three methods of scaling noise for extrapolation: time-stretching the two-qubit gates, scaling the sideband amplitude parameter, and inserting two-qubit gate identity operations into the ansatz circuit. We find time-stretching and sideband amplitude scaling fail to scale the noise on our particular hardware in a way that can be directly extrapolated to zero noise. Scaling our noise with global gate identity insertions and extrapolating after variational optimization, we achieve an estimate of the ground state energy within -0.004 +- 0.04 Hartree; outside chemical accuracy, but greatly improved over our non-error-mitigated estimate with error 0.127 +- 0.008 Hartree. Our results show that the efficacy of this error mitigation technique depends on choosing the correct implementation for a given device architecture.</description>

      <title>Sampling Error Analysis in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) is an emerging method used in place of quantum phase estimation in the early fault-tolerant era, where limited quantum circuit depth is available. In contrast to the classical Krylov subspace diagonalization (KSD) or the Lanczos method, QKSD exploits the quantum computer to efficiently estimate the eigenvalues of large-size Hamiltonians through a faster Krylov projection. However, unlike classical KSD, which is solely concerned with machine precision, QKSD is inherently accompanied by errors originating from a finite number of samples. Moreover, due to difficulty establishing an artificial orthogonal basis, ill-conditioning problems are often encountered, rendering the solution vulnerable to noise. In this work, we present a nonasymptotic theoretical framework to assess the relationship between sampling noise and its effects on eigenvalues. We also propose an optimal solution to cope with large condition numbers by eliminating the ill-conditioned bases. Numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model demonstrate that the error bound of finite samplings accurately predicts the experimental errors in well-conditioned regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a hardware-efficient ansatz for variational optimization, derived from existing ansatze in the literature, that parametrizes subsets of all interactions in the Cost Hamiltonian in each layer. We treat gate orderings as a variational parameter and observe that doing so can provide significant performance boosts in experiments. We carried out experimental runs of a compilation-optimized implementation of fully-connected Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonians on a 50-qubit linear-chain subsystem of Rigetti Aspen-M-3 transmon processor. Our results indicate that, for the best circuit designs tested, the average performance at optimized angles and gate orderings increases with circuit depth (using more parameters), despite the presence of a high level of noise. We report performance significantly better than using a random guess oracle for circuits involving up to approx 5000 two-qubit and approx 5000 one-qubit native gates. We additionally discuss various takeaways of our results toward more effective utilization of current and future quantum processors for optimization.</description>

      <title>On the limitations of the semi-classical picture in high harmonic generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent progress in the quantum optical formulation of the process of high harmonic generation has reached a point where the successful semi-classical model shows its limitations. So far the light source which drives the process was considered to be provided by a laser, in agreement with the classical picture. However, quantum optics allows to consider light fields beyond the classical realm, such as bright squeezed vacuum of photon number states. Both field states have vanishing mean electric field amplitudes, but can still lead to the generation of high harmonic radiation for sufficiently high intensities. This poses new questions about the range of validity of the semi-classical picture, and allows to extend the domain of questions which could possibly be asked.</description>

      <title>Absence of quantum optical coherence in high harmonic generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05010v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical phase of the driving field in the process of high harmonic generation and the coherence properties of the harmonics are fundamental concepts in attosecond physics. Here, we consider to drive the process by incoherent classical and non-classical light fields exhibiting an undetermined optical phase. With this we introduce the notion of quantum optical coherence into high harmonic generation, and show that high harmonics can be generated from incoherent radiation despite having a vanishing electric field. We explicitly derive the quantum state of the harmonics when driven by carrier-envelope phase unstable fields and show that the generated harmonics are incoherent and exhibiting zero electric field amplitudes. We find that the quantum state of each harmonic is diagonal in its photon number basis, but nevertheless has the exact same photon statistics as the widely considered coherent harmonics. From this we conclude that assuming coherent harmonic radiation can originate from a preferred ensemble fallacy. These findings have profound implications for attosecond experiments and how to infer about the harmonic radiation properties.</description>

Abstract: Traditional measures of entropy, like the Von Neumann entropy, while fundamental in quantum information theory, are insufficient when interpreted as thermodynamic entropy due to their invariance under unitary transformations, which contradicts observed entropy increases in isolated systems. Recognizing this limitations of existing measures for thermodynamic entropy, recent research has focused on observational entropy (OE) as a promising alternative, offering practical applicability and theoretical insights. In this work, we extend the scope of observational entropy by generalizing it to a parameterized version called $\alpha$-Observational entropy ($\alpha$-OE). $\alpha$-OE is expressed in terms of the Petz-R\'{e}nyi relative entropy between the states on which a quantum-to-classical channel is applied. The $\alpha$-OE reduces to OE under $\alpha\rightarrow 1$. We prove various properties of the $\alpha$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $\alpha$-OE as a function of refinement of coarse-graining. We further explore the role of $\alpha$-OE in thermodynamic contexts, particularly for the entropy production in open and closed quantum systems and its relation with the Helmholtz free energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum-centric Supercomputing for Materials Science: A Perspective on Challenges and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: Computational models are an essential tool for the design, characterization, and discovery of novel materials. Hard computational tasks in materials science stretch the limits of existing high-performance supercomputing centers, consuming much of their simulation, analysis, and data resources. Quantum computing, on the other hand, is an emerging technology with the potential to accelerate many of the computational tasks needed for materials science. In order to do that, the quantum technology must interact with conventional high-performance computing in several ways: approximate results validation, identification of hard problems, and synergies in quantum-centric supercomputing. In this paper, we provide a perspective on how quantum-centric supercomputing can help address critical computational problems in materials science, the challenges to face in order to solve representative use cases, and new suggested directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random matrix spectral correlations is a defining feature of quantum chaos. Here, we study such correlations in a minimal model of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics where interactions are confined to the system's boundary, dubbed \textit{boundary chaos}, in terms of the spectral form factor and its fluctuations. We exactly calculate the latter in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension $q$ for different classes of random boundary interactions and find it to coincide with random matrix theory, possibly after a non-zero Thouless time. The latter effect is due to a drastic enhancement of the spectral form factor, when integer time and system size fulfill a resonance condition. We compare our semiclassical (large $q$) results with numerics at small local Hilbert space dimension ($q=2,3$) and observe qualitatively similar features as in the semiclassical regime.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we consider different theoretical aspects and simple applications of the Milburn equation which is governed by a parameter controlling what is known as intrinsic decoherence. The main goal is to show some similarities also observed when external decoherence is considered. Linear entropy, Ehrenfest relations, probability density current, the Wigner representation as well as the relation to a Lindbladian master equation are analyzed in terms of this intrinsic decoherence, leading to new insights on the Milburn dynamics. Interference of two wave packets, tunneling and the bouncing ball problem are also studied under this perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum processors require a signal-delivery architecture with high addressability (low crosstalk) to ensure high performance already at the scale of dozens of qubits. Signal crosstalk causes inadvertent driving of quantum gates, which will adversely affect quantum-gate fidelities in scaled-up devices. Here, we demonstrate packaged flip-chip superconducting quantum processors with signal-crosstalk performance competitive with those reported in other platforms. For capacitively coupled qubit-drive lines, we find on-resonant crosstalk better than -27 dB (average -37 dB). For inductively coupled magnetic-flux-drive lines, we find less than 0.13 % direct-current flux crosstalk (average 0.05 %). These observed crosstalk levels are adequately small and indicate a decreasing trend with increasing distance, which is promising for further scaling up to larger numbers of qubits. We discuss the implication of our results for the design of a low-crosstalk, on-chip signal delivery architecture, including the influence of a shielding tunnel structure, potential sources of crosstalk, and estimation of crosstalk-induced qubit-gate error in scaled-up quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Hardware requirements for trapped-ion based verifiable blind quantum computing with a measurement-only client</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In blind quantum computing, a user with a simple client device can perform a quantum computation on a remote quantum server such that the server cannot gain knowledge about the computation. Here, we numerically investigate hardware requirements for verifiable blind quantum computing using an ion trap as server and a distant measurement-only client. While the client has no direct access to quantum-computing resources, it can remotely execute quantum programs on the server by measuring photons emitted by the trapped ion. We introduce a numerical model for trapped-ion quantum devices in NetSquid, a discrete-event simulator for quantum networks. Using this, we determine the minimal hardware requirements on a per-parameter basis to perform the verifiable blind quantum computing protocol. We benchmark these for a five-qubit linear graph state, with which any single-qubit rotation can be performed, where client and server are separated by 50 km. Current state-of-the-art ion traps satisfy the minimal requirements on a per-parameter basis, but all current imperfections combined make it impossible to perform the blind computation securely over 50 km using existing technology. Using a genetic algorithm, we determine the set of hardware parameters that minimises the total improvements required, finding directions along which to improve hardware to reach our threshold error probability that would enable experimental demonstration. In this way, we lay a path for the near-term experimental progress required to realise the implementation of verifiable blind quantum computing over a 50 km distance.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetic field on the Bose-Einstein condensation of quantum well exciton-polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the nonlinear effects of a magnetic field on the relaxation process of exciton-polaritons toward Bose-Einstein condensation in GaAs quantum wells. Our study reveals that the modification of the exciton's effective mass, Rabi splitting, and dispersion significantly alters the relaxation rate of polaritons as they approach condensation. By employing a quasi-stationary pump, we clarify the dynamics of the total and condensed polariton populations in response to varying magnetic field strengths. Notably, we demonstrate that under low-energy pumping conditions, the presence of a magnetic field significantly suppresses condensation. This suppression is attributed to the decreased scattering rate between energy levels, which is a consequence of the reduced steepness in the high-energy dispersion. Conversely, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field can enhance relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Kirkwood-Dirac classical states: A case study based on discrete Fourier transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) classicality or non-classicality is very important in quantum information processing. In general, the set of KD classical states with respect to two bases is not a convex polytope[J. Math. Phys. \textbf{65} 072201 (2024)], which makes us interested in finding out in which circumnstances they do form a polytope. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of KD classicality of mixed states for the case where the transition matrix between two bases is a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix in Hilbert space with dimensions $p^2$ and $pq$, respectively, where $p, q$ are prime. For the two particular cases we investigate, the sets of extremal points are finite, implying that the set of KD classical states we characterize forms a convex polytope. We show that for $p^2$ dimensional system, the set $\rm{KD}_{\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}}^+$ is a convex hull of the set $\rm {pure}({\rm {KD}_{\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}}^+})$ based on DFT, where $\rm{KD}_{\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}}^+$ is the set of KD classical states with respect to two bases and $\rm {pure}({\rm {KD}_{\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}}^+})$ is the set of all the rank-one projectors of KD classical pure states with respect to two bases. In $pq$ dimensional system, we believe that this result also holds. Unfortunately, we do not completely prove it, but some meaningful conclusions are obtained about the characterization of KD classicality.</description>

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a modulation transfer protocol to increase the detection sensitivity of a Rydberg RF receiver to fields out of resonance from the transition between Rydberg levels. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the control field used to create the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) signal. The nonlinear wave-mixing of the multi-component coupling laser and the probe laser transfers the modulation to the probe laser, which is used for RF-field detection. The measurements compare well with semi-classical simulations of atom-light interaction and show an improvement in the RF bandwidth of the sensor and an improved sensitivity of the response to weak fields.</description>

      <title>Locality, Correlations, Information, and non-Hermitian Quantum Systems</title>

Abstract: Local non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems generically exhibit breakdown of Lieb-Robinson (LR) bounds, motivating study of whether new locality measures might shed light not seen by existing measures. In this paper we extend the standard connected correlation function (CC) to NH systems in a form that recovers locality. Additionally, we use the metric formalism to derive a modified CC which recovers not just locality but even LR bounds in local $PT$-Symmetric systems, and discuss extensions of both CCs to the $n$-partite case. We show that in Hermitian systems $\delta\rho = \rho-\rho_A\otimes\rho_B$ can be written as a linear combination of CCs, allowing us to place an LR bound on $\Vert\delta\rho\Vert_2$. We show this generically extends to an LR bound on mutual information as well. We then extend this to NH systems, where we show its violations can be used to place a necessary condition on which NH Hamiltonians are capable of nonlocal entanglement generation. Numerical simulations are provided by means of exact diagonalization for the NH Transverse-Field Ising Model, demonstrating both breakdown and recovery of LR bounds.</description>

      <title>Quantifying nonclassicality of mixed Fock states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical states of bosonic modes are important resources for quantum-enhanced technologies. Yet, quantifying nonclassicality of these states, in particular mixed states, can be a challenge. Here we present results of quantifying the nonclassicality of a bosonic mode in a mixed Fock state via the operational resource theory (ORT) measure [W. Ge, K. Jacobs, S. Asiri, M. Foss-Feig, and M. S. Zubairy, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023400 (2020)], which relates nonclassicality to metrological advantage. Generally speaking, evaluating the ORT measure for mixed states is challenging, since it involves finding a convex roof. However, we show that our problem can be reduced to a linear programming problem. By analyzing the results of numerical optimization, we are able to extract exact, analytical results for the case where three or four neighboring Fock states have nonzero population. Interestingly, we find that such a mode can be in distinct phases, depending on the populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how our method is generalizable to density matrices of higher ranks. Our findings suggest a viable method for evaluating nonclassicality of arbitrary mixed bosonic states and potentially for solving other convex roof optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Feedback-driven quantum reservoir computing for time-series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a highly promising computational paradigm that leverages quantum systems as a computational resource for nonlinear information processing. While its application to time-series analysis is eagerly anticipated, prevailing approaches suffer from the collapse of the quantum state upon measurement, resulting in the erasure of temporal input memories. Neither repeated initializations nor weak measurements offer a fundamental solution, as the former escalates the time complexity while the latter restricts the information extraction from the Hilbert space. To address this issue, we propose the feedback-driven QRC framework. This methodology employs projective measurements on all qubits for unrestricted access to the quantum state, with the measurement outcomes subsequently fed back into the reservoir to restore the memory of prior inputs. We demonstrate that our QRC successfully acquires the fading-memory property through the feedback connections, a critical element in time-series processing. Notably, analysis of measurement trajectories reveal three distinct phases depending on the feedback strength, with the memory performance maximized at the edge of chaos. We also evaluate the predictive capabilities of our QRC, demonstrating its suitability for forecasting signals originating from quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Global Out of Time Order Correlators as a Signature of Scrambling Dynamics of Local Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-Time-Order Correlators (OTOCs) serve as a proxy for quantum information scrambling, which refers to the process where information stored locally disperses across the many-body degrees of freedom in a quantum system, rendering it inaccessible to local probes. Most experimental implementations of OTOCs to probe information scrambling rely on indirect measurements based on global observables, using techniques such as Loschmidt echoes and Multiple Quantum Coherences, via time reversal evolutions. In this article, we establish a direct connection between OTOCs with global and local observables in the context of NMR experiments, where the observable is the total magnetization of the system. We conduct a numerical analysis to quantify the differences in the evolution of both magnitudes, evaluating the excitation dynamics in spin ring systems with 8 to 16 spins, using a many-body Hamiltonian and long-range interactions. Our analysis decomposes the global echo into a sum of local echoes and cross-contributions, leading to local and global OTOCs. The results indicate that, after an initial transient period, local OTOCs determine the global ones. We observe that the difference between the average of local OTOCs and the global one, as well as their fluctuations, becomes negligible as the system size increases. Thus, for large homogeneous systems, global and local OTOCs become equivalent. This behavior aligns with that observed in highly interacting or chaotic systems in several experiments.</description>

      <title>Restrictions imposed by a pure quantum state on the results of measuring the momentum of a particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that quantum mechanics, including the Born rule for calculating the expectation values of observables for a particle in a given pure state and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, imposes not only statistical restrictions on the results of measuring observables, but also restrictions on the values of observables themselves that are subject to measurement. However, these restrictions are not as strong as follows from Bohm mechanics. In particular, the quantum formalism defines in the configuration space not one, but two fields of the particle momentum. Both fields satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. And the key role here is played by the fact that one of the contributions to the Bohm `potential' is actually a contribution to the field characterizing the kinetic energy of the particle.</description>

      <title>Methods to achieve near-millisecond energy relaxation and dephasing times for a superconducting transmon qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are one of the most promising physical systems for implementing quantum computers. However, executing quantum algorithms of practical computational advantage requires further improvements in the fidelities of qubit operations, which are currently limited by the energy relaxation and dephasing times of the qubits. Here, we report our measurement results of a high-coherence transmon qubit with energy relaxation and echo dephasing times surpassing those in the existing literature. We measure a qubit frequency of 2.890 GHz, an energy relaxation time with a median of 502 us and a maximum of (765 +/- 82.6) us, and an echo dephasing time with a median of 541 us and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138) us. We report in detail our design, fabrication process, and measurement setup to facilitate the reproduction and wide adoption of high-coherence transmon qubits in the academia and industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</description>

      <title>Contextual Subspace Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo: Improved bias with reduced quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using trial wavefunctions prepared on quantum devices to reduce the bias of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) has established itself as a promising hybrid approach to the simulation of strongly correlated many body systems. Here, we further reduce the required quantum resources by decomposing the trial wavefunction into classical and quantum parts, respectively treated by classical and quantum devices, within the contextual subspace projection formalism. Importantly, we show that our algorithm is compatible with the recently developed matchgate shadow protocol for efficient overlap calculation in QC-AFQMC. Investigating the nitrogen dimer and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate in lithium-based batteries, we observe that our method outperforms a number of established algorithm for ground state energy computations, while reaching chemical accuracy with less than half of the original number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Ground state of the gauge invariant Dicke model: condensation of the photons in non-classical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of two physically motivated modifications of the Dicke model. The first modification corresponds to particles whose phase space contains only two states, for example, particles with spin 1/2 or artificially created qubits. The second modification describes two-level systems that arise as a result of truncating the full Hilbert space of atoms to two levels that are in resonance with the electromagnetic field and are described by the gauge-invariant Dicke model. We demonstrate that the behavior of these systems is qualitatively distinct in both cases. In particular, in the first scenario, a phase transition into the state with a non-zero amplitude of the classical field is possible, while in the second case, the so-called order parameter $\eta = \braket{\hat{a}}$ of the field's phase transition into a coherent state with photon condensation is zero. At the same time, the average number of photons $\bar{n} = \braket{\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a}} \neq 0$, and the collective excitation in the system manifests a non-classical "squeezed" state of the field. We analyze the observable characteristics of both systems in a wide range of variation of their parameters.</description>

      <title>Decoherence due to Casimir effect?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the electron are suppressed due to the sudden switching on of the interaction with the environment, and would not be observationally relevant in typical scenarios. The work clarifies important theoretical aspects of the setup and argues that any irreversible loss of coherence, in general, should not be ascribed to vacuum fluctuations. It can only originate from emission of bremsstrahlung by the electron, due to the acceleration caused by the effective Coulomb potential of all the infinite image charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithmic Quantum and Classical Simulations by Corrected Product Formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation using product formulas is arguably the most straightforward and practical approach for algorithmic simulation of a quantum system's dynamics on a quantum computer. Here we present corrected product formulas (CPFs), a variation of product formulas achieved by injecting auxiliary terms called correctors into standard product formulas. We establish several correctors that greatly improve the accuracy of standard product formulas for simulating Hamiltonians comprised of two partitions that can be exactly simulated, a common feature of lattice Hamiltonians, while only adding a small additive or multiplicative factor to the simulation cost. We show that correctors are particularly advantageous for perturbed systems, where one partition has a relatively small norm compared to the other, as they allow the small norm to be utilized as an additional parameter for controlling the simulation error. We demonstrate the performance of CPFs by numerical simulations for several lattice Hamiltonians. Numerical results show our theoretical error bound for CPFs matches or exceeds the empirical error of standard product formulas for these systems. CPFs could be a valuable algorithmic tool for early fault-tolerant quantum computers with limited computing resources. As for standard product formulas, CPFs could also be used for simulations on a classical computer.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Shor's quantum algorithm for computing general discrete logarithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.09084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We heuristically show that Shor's algorithm for computing general discrete logarithms achieves an expected success probability of approximately 60% to 82% in a single run when modified to enable efficient implementation with the semi-classical Fourier transform. By slightly increasing the number of group operations that are evaluated quantumly and performing a single limited search in the classical post-processing, or by performing two limited searches in the post-processing, we show how the algorithm can be further modified to achieve a success probability that heuristically exceeds 99% in a single run. We provide concrete heuristic estimates of the success probability of the modified algorithm, as a function of the group order $r$, the size of the search space in the classical post-processing, and the additional number of group operations evaluated quantumly. In the limit as $r \rightarrow \infty$, we heuristically show that the success probability tends to one. In analogy with our earlier works, we show how the modified quantum algorithm may be heuristically simulated classically when the logarithm $d$ and $r$ are both known. Furthermore, we heuristically show how slightly better tradeoffs may be achieved, compared to our earlier works, if $r$ is known when computing $d$. We generalize our heuristic to cover some of our earlier works, and compare it to the non-heuristic analyses in those works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance occurs when two or more emitters cooperatively interact via the electromagnetic field. This collective light scattering process has been extensively studied across various platforms, from atoms to quantum dots and organic molecules. Despite extensive research, the precise role of direct interactions between emitters in superradiance remains elusive, particularly in many-body systems where the complexity of interactions poses significant challenges. In this study, we investigate the effect of dipole-dipole interaction between 18,000 atoms in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on the superradiance process. In dipolar BECs, we simplify the complex effect of anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction with Bogoliubov transformation. We observe that anisotropic Bogoliubov excitation breaks the mirror symmetry in decay modes of superradiance.</description>

      <title>Many-body-localization protection of eigenstate topological order in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) has been proposed to enable and protect topological order in all eigenstates, vastly expanding the traditional ground-state setting. However, for the most intriguing case of two-dimensional (2D) systems with anyons and topology-dependent degeneracies, the dense many-body spectrum challenges studying this MBL protection numerically. Here we use large-scale full-spectrum variational ans\"atze to demonstrate MBL-protected topological order in the disordered 2D toric code perturbed by magnetic fields. We show that the system has topological local integrals of motion (tLIOMs) for magnetic field strengths below $h_c\approx0.1$ times the toric code coupling scale. Combining tLIOMs with exact diagonalization, we also identify high-energy topological multiplets in the dense many-body spectrum. The phase diagram we find is consistent with toric-code and trivial MBL phases being separated by an intervening thermal phase.</description>

      <title>Sagnac effect in a rotating ring with Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of the Sagnac effect for massive material particles offers a significant enhancement in sensitivity when compared to optical interferometers with equal area and angular rotation velocity. For this reason, there have been suggestions to employ solid-state interferometers that rely on semiconductors and graphene. We investigate the Sagnac effect in Dirac materials governed by the relativisticlike quasiparticle dispersion law and show that the fringe shift is still determined by the mass of a free electron. This confirms that graphene is indeed a promising material for creating solid-state Sagnac interferometers. Considering monolayer graphene with its linear dispersion law and comparing it with light provides a deeper understanding of the Sagnac effect.</description>

      <title>Dissipative frequency converter: from Lindblad dynamics to non-Hermitian topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological frequency converter represents a dynamical counterpart of the integer quantum Hall effect, where a two-level system enacts a quantized time-averaged power transfer between two driving modes of incommensurate frequency. Here, we investigate as to what extent temporal coherence in the quantum dynamics of the two-level system is important for the topological quantization of the converter. To this end, we consider dissipative channels corresponding to spontaneous decay and dephasing in the instantaneous eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian as well as spontaneous decay in a fixed basis. The dissipation is modelled using both a full Lindblad and an effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian description. For all three dissipation channels we find a transition from the unperturbed dynamics to a quantum watchdog effect, which destroys any power transfer in the strong coupling limit. This is striking because the watchdog effect leads to perfectly adiabatic dynamics in the instantaneous eigenbasis, at first glance similar to the unperturbed case. Furthermore, it is found that dephasing immediately leads to an exponential decay of the power transfer in time due to loss of polarisation in the mixed quantum state. Finally, we discuss the appearance in the effective NH trajectory description of non-adiabatic processes, which are suppressed in the full Lindblad dynamics.</description>

      <title>Magnon-microwave backaction noise evasion in cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cavity magnomechanical systems, magnetic excitations couple simultaneously with mechanical vibrations and microwaves, incorporating the tunability of magnetism and the long lifetimes of mechanical modes. Applications of such systems, such as thermometry and sensing, require precise measurement of the mechanical degree-of-freedom. In this paper, we propose a scheme for realizing backaction evading measurements of the mechanical vibrations in cavity magnomechanics. Our proposal involves driving the microwave cavity with two tones separated by twice the phonon frequency and with amplitudes satisfying a balance relation. We show that the minimum added imprecision noise is obtained for drives centered around the lower frequency magnon-microwave polaritons, which can beat the standard quantum limit at modest drive amplitudes. Our scheme is a simple and flexible way of engineering backaction evasion measurements that can be further generalized to other multimode systems.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the Relaxation Time of Boundary-Dissipative Systems through Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Numerical approach to the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bell-CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) inequality in the vacuum state of a relativistic scalar quantum field is analyzed. Using Weyl operators built with smeared fields localized in the Rindler wedges, the Bell-CHSH inequality is expressed in terms of the Lorentz invariant inner products of test functions. A numerical framework for these inner products is devised. Causality is also explicitly checked by a numerical evaluation of the Pauli-Jordan function. Violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality are reported for different values of the particle mass parameter.</description>

      <title>Cahier de l'Institut Pascal: Noisy Quantum Dynamics and Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a conference proceeding in the framework of workshop "OpenQMBP2023" at Institute Pascal (Orsay, France) and associated to the lecture given by Prof. Ehud Altman. We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent results in the context of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in quantum systems, with a particular focus on hybrid quantum circuits as a model system in one-dimension. Recent results, demonstrate how varying the rate of projective measurements can induce phase transitions, resulting in abrupt changes in the properties of the entanglement. The interplay between unitary evolution and measurement processes can be investigated, through mappings to classical statistical models and the application of replica field theory techniques. Starting from a low-entangled state, there can be three regimes characterized by different dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropies for a portion of the system: high-rate measurements leading to rapid entanglement saturation (area law), low-rate measurements allowing linear entanglement growth (up to volume law), and a critical rate at which entanglement grows logarithmically. Finally, we present results on the non-local effects of local measurements by examining the field theory of critical ground states in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids.</description>

      <title>QED Corrections in Unstable Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-energy and vacuum polarization effects in quantum electrodynamics (QED) are calculated for the supercritical Coulomb field, where Dirac energy levels become embedded in the negative-energy continuum. In this regime, the quantum vacuum becomes unstable, resulting in spontaneous electron-positron pair creation. By calculating the imaginary part of the QED correction, we gain access to an unexplored channel of vacuum instability: radiative spontaneous pair creation. Our results show that this radiative channel is greatly enhanced in the vicinity of the threshold of the supercritical regime, providing evidence for nonperturbative effects with respect to the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. We therefore conjecture that the total probability of spontaneous pair creation could differ significantly from the predictions of Dirac theory, especially near the supercritical threshold.</description>
