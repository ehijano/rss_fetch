      <title>Bounded confidence modeling predicts how group work affects student math anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Math anxiety is ubiquitous. It not only affects student performance and confidence, but also can lead to avoidance of further math/STEM classes and careers. Cooperative learning (i.e., group work) is a proven strategy that can reduce math anxiety and has additional social and pedagogical benefits. However, depending on the individuals involved, some peer interactions may mitigate anxiety while others exacerbate it. Mathematical modeling is one approach to help untangle this complex dynamic. In this work we introduce a bounded confidence model to evaluate how math anxiety levels are affected by student group work. Although the model is quite simple, it captures non-obvious phenomena including how varying group sizes and frequency of switching groups can affect anxiety levels. The model is easily adaptable to incorporate additional personal and societal factors making it ripe for future research.</description>

      <title>Topological Determinants of Resilience in Urban Rail Networks Facing Multi-Hazard Disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the failure and recovery, two key components of resilience of nine major urban rail networks - Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, Delhi, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, London, and New York - against multi-hazard scenarios utilizing a quantitative approach focused on topological parameters to evaluate network resilience. Employing percolation-based network dismantling approach like Sequential Removal of Nodes and Giant Connected Component analysis, alongside random, centrality-based targeted attacks and flooding failure, findings reveal Domirank centrality's superior resilience in disruption and recovery phases. Kendall's tau coefficient's application further elucidates the relationships between network properties and resilience, underscoring larger networks' vulnerability yet faster recovery due to inherent redundancy and connectivity. Key attributes like average degree and path length consistently influence recovery effectiveness, while the clustering coefficient's positive correlation with recovery highlights the benefits of local interconnectivity. This analysis emphasizes the critical role of select nodes and the importance of balancing network design for enhanced resilience, offering insights for future urban rail system planning against multi-hazard threats.</description>

      <title>Paradise-disorder transition in structural balance dynamics on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural balance has been posited as one of the factors influencing how friendly and hostile relations of social actors evolve over time. This study investigates the behavior of the Heider balance model in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs in the presence of a noisy environment, particularly the transition from an initially entirely positively polarized paradise state to a disordered phase. We examine both single-layer and bilayer network configurations and provide a mean-field solution for the average link polarization that predicts a first-order transition where the critical temperature scales with the connection probability $p$ as $p^2$ for a monolayer system and in a more complex way for a bilayer. We show that to mimic the dynamics observed in complete graphs, the intralayer Heider interaction strengths should be scaled as $p^{-2}$, while the interlayer interaction strengths should be scaled as $p^{-1}$ for random graphs. Numerical simulations have been performed, and their results confirm our analytical predictions, provided that graphs are dense enough.</description>

      <title>From Contact to Threat: A Social Network Perspective on Perceptions of Immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our perceptions are shaped by the social networks we are embedded in. Despite the acknowledged influence of close contacts on how we perceive the world, the role of the broader social environment remains opaque. Here, we leverage a unique combination of population-scale social network and survey data on perceptions of immigration. We find that both direct contacts and a wider social network exposure to migrants matter. Notably, for natives, network exposure shows a shift from positive to negative association with perceptions of immigration beyond a certain exposure threshold. The multi-layer nature of our data highlights this tipping point for next-door neighbors, with private social contexts exhibiting a positive relationship between exposure and immigration perceptions. Furthermore, it shows that contacts spanning multiple contexts also strengthen this relationship. The provided insights on the interplay between network composition and attitudes toward immigration highlight generic patterns shaping public opinion on pressing societal issues.</description>

      <title>Structural dynamics of plant-pollinator mutualistic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discourse surrounding the structural organization of mutualistic interactions mostly revolves around modularity and nestedness. The former is known to enhance the stability of communities, while the latter is related to their feasibility, albeit compromising the stability. However, it has recently been shown that the joint emergence of these structures poses challenges that can eventually lead to limitations in the dynamic properties of mutualistic communities. We hypothesize that considering compound arrangements -- modules with internal nested organization -- can offer valuable insights in this debate. We analyze the temporal structural dynamics of 20 plant-pollinator interaction networks and observe large structural variability throughout the year. Compound structures are particularly prevalent during the peak of the pollination season, often coexisting with nested and modular arrangements in varying degrees. Motivated by these empirical findings, we synthetically investigate the dynamics of the structural patterns across two control parameters -- community size and connectance levels -- mimicking the progression of the pollination season. Our analysis reveals contrasting impacts on the stability and feasibility of these mutualistic communities. We characterize the consistent relationship between network structure and stability, which follows a monotonic pattern. But, in terms of feasibility, we observe non-linear relationships. Compound structures exhibit a favorable balance between stability and feasibility, particularly in mid-sized ecological communities, suggesting they may effectively navigate the simultaneous requirements of stability and feasibility. These findings may indicate that the assembly process of mutualistic communities is driven by a delicate balance among multiple properties, rather than the dominance of a single one.</description>

      <title>The temporal dynamics of group interactions in higher-order social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representing social systems as networks, starting from the interactions between individuals, sheds light on the mechanisms governing their dynamics. However, networks encode only pairwise interactions, while most social interactions occur among groups of individuals, requiring higher-order network representations. Despite the recent interest in higher-order networks, little is known about the mechanisms that govern the formation and evolution of groups, and how people move between groups. Here, we leverage empirical data on social interactions among children and university students to study their temporal dynamics at both individual and group levels, characterising how individuals navigate groups and how groups form and disaggregate. We find robust patterns across contexts and propose a dynamical model that closely reproduces empirical observations. These results represent a further step in understanding social systems, and open up research directions to study the impact of group dynamics on dynamical processes that evolve on top of them.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Challenges and opportunities for high-quality battery production at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, the need for widespread electrification is now internationally recognized. As a result, global battery production is set to dramatically expand over the next decade. Unfortunately, however, batteries are both immensely difficult to produce at the gigawatt-hour scale and inordinately sensitive to minor manufacturing variation. As a result, the battery industry has already experienced a number of both highly-visible safety incidents and under-the-radar reliability issues -- a trend that will only worsen if left unaddressed. In this perspective, we highlight both the challenges and opportunities to enable battery quality at scale. We first describe the interplay between various battery failure modes and their numerous root causes. We then discuss the tensions at play to manage and improve battery quality during cell production. We hope our perspective brings greater visibility to the battery quality challenge to enable safe global electrification.</description>
