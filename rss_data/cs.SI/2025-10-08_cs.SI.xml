      <title>Emergent Directedness in Social Contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An enduring challenge in contagion theory is that the pathways contagions follow through social networks exhibit emergent complexities that are difficult to predict using network structure. Here, we address this challenge by developing a causal modeling framework that (i) simulates the possible network pathways that emerge as contagions spread and (ii) identifies which edges and nodes are most impactful on diffusion across these possible pathways. This yields a surprising discovery. If people require exposure to multiple peers to adopt a contagion (a.k.a., 'complex contagions'), the pathways that emerge often only work in one direction. In fact, the more complex a contagion is, the more asymmetric its paths become. This emergent directedness problematizes canonical theories of how networks mediate contagion. Weak ties spanning network regions - widely thought to facilitate mutual influence and integration - prove to privilege the spread contagions from one community to the other. Emergent directedness also disproportionately channels complex contagions from the network periphery to the core, inverting standard centrality models. We demonstrate two practical applications. We show that emergent directedness accounts for unexplained nonlinearity in the effects of tie strength in a recent study of job diffusion over LinkedIn. Lastly, we show that network evolution is biased toward growing directed paths, but that cultural factors (e.g., triadic closure) can curtail this bias, with strategic implications for network building and behavioral interventions.</description>

      <title>AgentZero++: Modeling Fear-Based Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AgentZero++, an agent-based model that integrates cognitive, emotional, and social mechanisms to simulate decentralized collective violence in spatially distributed systems. Building on Epstein's Agent\_Zero framework, we extend the original model with eight behavioral enhancements: age-based impulse control; memory-based risk estimation; affect-cognition coupling; endogenous destructive radius; fight-or-flight dynamics; affective homophily; retaliatory damage; and multi-agent coordination. These additions allow agents to adapt based on internal states, previous experiences, and social feedback, producing emergent dynamics such as protest asymmetries, escalation cycles, and localized retaliation. Implemented in Python using the Mesa ABM framework, AgentZero++ enables modular experimentation and visualization of how micro-level cognitive heterogeneity shapes macro-level conflict patterns. Our results highlight how small variations in memory, reactivity, and affective alignment can amplify or dampen unrest through feedback loops. By explicitly modeling emotional thresholds, identity-driven behavior, and adaptive networks, this work contributes a flexible and extensible platform for analyzing affective contagion and psychologically grounded collective action.</description>

      <title>Inductive inference of gradient-boosted decision trees on graphs for insurance fraud detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies. That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine (G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world, proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights into the predictions made by G-GBM.</description>

      <title>Overlapping community detection in weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, community detection in overlapping un-weighted networks, where nodes can belong to multiple communities, has been one of the most popular topics in modern network science. However, community detection in overlapping weighted networks, where edge weights can be any real value, remains challenging. In this article, we propose a generative model called the weighted degree-corrected mixed membership (WDCMM) model to model such weighted networks. This model adopts the same factorization for the expectation of the adjacency matrix as the previous degree-corrected mixed membership (DCMM) model. Our WDCMM extends the DCMM from un-weighted networks to weighted networks by allowing the elements of the adjacency matrix to be generated from distributions beyond Bernoulli. We first address the community membership estimation of the model by applying a spectral algorithm and establishing a theoretical guarantee of consistency. Then, we propose overlapping weighted modularity to measure the quality of overlapping community detection for both assortative and dis-assortative weighted networks. To determine the number of communities, we incorporate the algorithm into the proposed modularity. We demonstrate the advantages of the model and the modularity through applications to simulated data and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Online Community Detection for Censored Block Models: Algorithms and Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the private online change detection problem for dynamic communities, using a censored block model (CBM). We consider edge differential privacy (DP) in both local and central settings, and propose joint change detection and community estimation procedures for both scenarios. We seek to understand the fundamental tradeoffs between the privacy budget, detection delay, and exact community recovery of community labels. Further, we provide theoretical guarantees for the effectiveness of our proposed method by showing necessary and sufficient conditions for change detection and exact recovery under edge DP. Simulation and real data examples are provided to validate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior on TikTok: Challenges and Opportunities for Detection in a Video-First Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) is central to the study of online influence operations. However, most methods focus on text-centric platforms, leaving video-first ecosystems like TikTok largely unexplored. To address this gap, we develop and evaluate a computational framework for detecting CIB on TikTok, leveraging a network-based approach adapted to the platform's unique content and interaction structures. Building on existing approaches, we construct user similarity networks based on shared behaviors, including synchronized posting, repeated use of similar captions, multimedia content reuse, and hashtag sequence overlap, and apply graph pruning techniques to identify dense networks of likely coordinated accounts. Analyzing a dataset of 793K TikTok videos related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we uncover a range of coordinated activities, from synchronized amplification of political narratives to semi-automated content replication using AI-generated voiceovers and split-screen video formats. Our findings show that while traditional coordination indicators generalize well to TikTok, other signals, such as those based on textual similarity of video transcripts or Duet and Stitch interactions, prove ineffective, highlighting the platform's distinct content norms and interaction mechanics. This work provides the first empirical foundation for studying and detecting CIB on TikTok, paving the way for future research into influence operations in short-form video platforms.</description>

      <title>HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, but these models are typically adapted from image generation frameworks and overlook inherent higher-order topology, leaving them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff), a principled framework that progressively generates plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. HOG-Diff follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum guided by higher-order topology and implemented via diffusion bridges. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</description>

      <title>Learning Exposure Mapping Functions for Inferring Heterogeneous Peer Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In causal inference, interference refers to the phenomenon in which the actions of peers in a network can influence an individual's outcome. Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method is more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when estimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Cosmos 1.0: a multidimensional map of the emerging technology frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Cosmos 1.0 dataset and describes a novel methodology for creating and mapping a universe of technologies, adjacent concepts, and entities. We utilise various source data that contain a rich diversity and breadth of contemporary knowledge. The Cosmos 1.0 dataset comprises 23,544 technology-adjacent entities (TA23k) with a hierarchical structure and eight categories of external indices. Each entity is represented by a 100-dimensional contextual embedding vector, which we use to assign it to seven thematic tech-clusters (TC7) and three meta tech-clusters (TC3). We manually verify 100 emerging technologies (ET100). This dataset is enriched with additional indices specifically developed to assess the landscape of emerging technologies, including the Technology Awareness Index, Generality Index, Deeptech, and Age of Tech Index. The dataset incorporates extensive metadata sourced from Wikipedia and linked data from third-party sources such as Crunchbase, Google Books, OpenAlex and Google Scholar, which are used to validate the relevance and accuracy of the constructed indices.</description>
