      <title>Experimentally controlling scattering of water waves in correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave propagation in complex media is a universal problem spanning optics, acoustics, mechanics, and condensed matter physics. While disorder usually causes strong scattering, recent theory predicts that a special class of correlated disorder, known as stealthy hyperuniformity, can suppress scattering at long wavelengths, making a material transparent despite remaining structurally disordered and far from a simple homogenization regime. Experimental evidence of this remarkable transport regime within a medium has, however, remained limited. Here we report a direct, spatially resolved experimental observation of a transition between scattering and non-scattering wave transport induced by hyperuniform correlations. Using water waves as a model platform, we image both the amplitude and phase of the wavefield as it propagates through a two-dimensional disordered structure. This enables us to extract quantitative transport observables, including extinction lengths, statistical fluctuations, and energy-flow patterns, and to directly identify the boundary of the hyperuniform transparency regime. Our results provide a quantitative experimental validation of the transport regimes predicted for stealthy hyperuniform disorder and demonstrate that correlated disorder offers a powerful and practical route to control wave propagation in realistic systems across wave physics.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network for multitask prediction of rheological and microstructural behavior in suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast prediction of suspension rheology is fundamental for optimizing process efficiency and performance in numerous industrial settings. However, traditional simulations are computationally demanding due to explicit evaluation of contact networks and stress tensors in dense regimes approaching shear thickening and jamming. This study presents a microstructure-informed multitask learning framework based on the graph neural network (GNN) that learns an implicit mapping between particle configurations and emergent microstructural and rheological properties of suspensions. This model simultaneously predicts particle pressure $\Pi$, viscosity $\eta$, and friction coordination $Z_\mu$, in a dynamic steady-state, without explicit knowledge of interparticle forces. Here, semi-dilute to dense suspension systems in 2D were simulated across a wide range of shear stresses $\sigma$, spanning continuous, discontinuous shear thickening, and shear-jamming conditions. The trained models demonstrated high correlation coefficients ($R^2$ = 0.99) with narrow mean absolute error for packing fractions up to $\phi \le \phi_J^\mu$ for all predictive targets. However, prediction scatter increases near jamming conditions, attributed to inherent fluctuations in suspension behavior as the critical packing fraction is approached, yet predictions remain in excellent agreement, closely following the trend of the simulated flow curves across stress evolution. Once trained, the model can infer rheological responses directly from structural topology, avoiding explicit stress evaluation during prediction. The approach yields computationally efficient mesoscale surrogates for accelerated simulation with potential for real-time exploration of particulate suspension behavior.</description>

      <title>Yielding behaviour of glasses under shear deformation at constant pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulations of yielding of glasses under shear have typically been performed under constant volume, strain controlled protocols. However, volumetric effects, such as the dilatancy associated with plastic rearrangements, and the observed reduction of density in shear bands, make it interesting to consider constant pressure shear protocols. We present a computational investigation on the nature of yielding of glasses under constant-pressure conditions, for different pressures. For uniform shear, the stress-strain curves at different pressures differ only by the stress scale. We find stable shear bands under cyclic shear whose steady-state width increases with an increase in external pressure, with density within shear bands being lower compared to the average values reached. Cyclically sheared well annealed glasses yield with a discontinuous dilation at the yield point, whereas the poorly annealed glasses undergo compaction before yielding accompanied by dilation. The external pressure influences the quantitative mechanical response of the glasses, but the qualitative behaviour is similar at different pressures, and remains the same as that of yielding at the constant-volume strain-controlled conditions. We discuss directions along with further investigations may be pursued, based on the results presented.</description>

      <title>Continuum-statistical dynamics of colloidal suspensions under kinematic reversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuum-statistical framework for colloidal dynamics to first order in the applied forces, based on the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and a reassessment of the conditions under which kinematic reversibility emerges in continuum mechanics. The theory recovers known results for buoyancy, phoretic motion, and active swimming, and extends them to include the effect of advective transport and hydrostatic many-body interactions through the colloidal osmotic pressure. The resulting formulation is consistent with Onsager's theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, thus providing a unified perspective on reciprocal relations in colloidal transport.</description>

      <title>From Connectivity to Rupture: A Coarse-Grained Stochastic Network Dynamics Approach to Polymer Network Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse-grained stochastic network dynamics (CGSND) framework for modeling deformation and rupture in polymer networks. The method replaces explicit molecular dynamics (MD) or coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) with network-level evolution rules while retaining chain entropic elasticity and force-controlled bond failure. Under uniaxial loading, CGSND reproduces the characteristic nonlinear stress--stretch response of elastomeric networks, including a well-defined ultimate tensile strength and post-peak softening due to progressive bond rupture. Comparison with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations shows that CGSND captures the qualitative form of the stress response and the onset of catastrophic damage despite its rate-independent formulation. Analysis of rupture kinetics reveals a pronounced peak in the bond-breaking hazard rate near the ultimate tensile strength in both approaches. In addition, the distribution of broken segment lengths remains statistically indistinguishable from the initial network, indicating that rupture is not biased toward short or long chains. Finally, the evolution of the Gini coefficient of bond force magnitudes reveals strong force localization preceding failure. These results demonstrate that CGSND provides a computationally efficient and physically interpretable framework for connecting force localization and rupture kinetics to macroscopic failure in polymer networks.</description>

      <title>Constitutive flow law for hydrogel granular rafts near the brittle-ductile transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially varying flow laws have been identified in dry granular flow, yet their applicability to unjammed suspensions remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the quasistatic suspension flow combines dry granular rheology with nonlocal effects in the shear band and damped viscous flow in the outer creep region. Through rotary shear experiments on a hydrogel granular raft, we observe that the flow decays from the interface in the quasistatic regime, where the particles remain mobile even below the yield stress. These findings suggest the universal flow law across the transition between jammed/brittle granular behavior and unjammed/ductile viscous flow.</description>

      <title>Mixing properties of bi-disperse ellipsoid assemblies: Mean-field behaviour in a granular matter experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and spatial statistical properties of amorphous ellipsoid assemblies have profound scientific and industrial significance in many systems, from cell assays to granular materials. This paper uses a fundamental theoretical relationship for mixture distributions to explain the observations of an extensive X-ray computed tomography study of granular ellipsoidal packings. We study a size-bi-disperse mixture of two types of ellipsoids of revolutions that have the same aspect ratio of alpha approximately equal to 0.57 and differ in size, by about 10% in linear dimension, and compare these to mono-disperse systems of ellipsoids with the same aspect ratio. Jammed configurations with a range of packing densities are achieved by employing different tapping protocols. We numerically interrogate the final packing configurations by analyses of the local packing fraction distributions calculated from the Voronoi diagrams. Our main finding is that the bi-disperse ellipsoidal packings studied here can be interpreted as a mixture of two uncorrelated mono-disperse packings, insensitive to the compaction protocol. Our results are consolidated by showing that the local packing fraction shows no correlation beyond their first shell of neighbours in the binary mixtures. We propose a model of uncorrelated binary mixture distribution that describes the observed experimental data with high accuracy. This analysis framework will enable future studies to test whether the observed mean-field behaviour is specific to the particular granular system or the specific parameter values studied here or if it is observed more broadly in other bi-disperse non-spherical particle systems.</description>

      <title>Quo vadis biophotonics? Wearing serendipity and slow science as a badge of pride, and embracing biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a reflection on the themes of the Faraday Discussion meeting on "Biological and bio-inspired optics" held from 20 to 22 July 2020. It is a personal perspective on the nature of this field as a broad and interdisciplinary field that has led to a sound understanding of the material properties of biological nanostructured and optical materials. The article describes how the nature of the field and the themes of the conference are reflected in particular in work on the 3D bicontinuous biophotonic nanostructures known as single gyroids and in bicontinuous structures more broadly. Such single gyroid materials are found for example in the butterfly Thecla opisena, where the questions of biophotonic response, of bio-inspired optics, of the relationship between structure and function, and of the relationship between natural and synthetic realisations are closely interlinked. This multitude of facets of research on single gyroid structures reflects the beauty of the broader field of biophotonics, namely as a field that lives through embracing the serendipitous discovery of the biophotonic marvels that nature offers to us as seeds for in-depth analysis and understanding. The meandering nature of its discoveries, and the need to accept the slowness that comes from exploration of intellectually new or foreign territory, mean that the field shares some traits with biological evolution itself. Looking into the future, I consider that a closer engagement with living tissue and with the biological questions of function and formation, rather than with the materials science of biological materials, will help ensure the continuing great success of this field.</description>

      <title>Shear-Induced Collective Shape Oscillations in Dense Soft Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense suspensions of deformable particles can exhibit rich nonequilibrium dynamics arising from complex flow-structure coupling. Using a multi-phase field model, we show that steady shear drives an initially disordered, dense, soft suspension into a positionally and orientationally ordered state, within which particles undergo robust self-sustained shape oscillations. These oscillations originate from repeated T1 neighbor exchanges that force the ordered particle lattice to cyclically traverse different ordered configurations, coupling particle deformation to evolving lattice topology. By identifying the lattice angle as a key variable, we construct a minimal one-degree-of-freedom model that quantitatively captures the limit cycle oscillation. Because these mechanisms rely only on deformability, packing, and shear, they provide a generic route to collective time-dependent behavior in dense soft suspensions.</description>

      <title>Coarse grained modeling of self assembled DNA 3D structure using pragmatic soft ellipsoid contact potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a coarse-grained model of DNA based on the soft ellipsoid contact potential (ECP) to evaluate the base pairing interaction properly. We extend the ellipsoid contact like potential model (ECP), suitably modified and used previously by our group to model lipid bilayer phases with considerable success. This potential is used for base-base interactions, along with other potentials to capture bending, dihedral and solvent effects. The model shows a phase transition during hybridization and is able to reproduce the experimental melting curves with sufficient adequacy. Thermodynamical, along with conformational characteristics and structural properties of our model are studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Homing through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homing and navigation are fundamental behaviors in biological systems that enable agents to reliably reach a target under uncertainty. We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to model adaptive homing in continuous two-dimensional domain. In this framework, the agent's state is given by its angular deviation from home, actions correspond to alignment or stochastic reorientation, and learning is driven by a radial-distance-based cost that penalizes motion away from the target. For a single self-propelled agent moving with constant speed, we find that the mean homing time $\langle T_{\mathrm{home}} \rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the rotational diffusion strength $D_r$, with an optimal noise level $D_r^{*}$, revealing a subtle interplay between exploration and goal-directed correction. Extending to two agents with soft repulsion, one agent consistently reaches home faster than the other, while in multi-agents system, repulsion ensures separation and the fastest agent becomes progressively faster as group size increases. Finally comparing the mean homing time $\langle T_{\mathrm{home}} \rangle$ of an Active Brownian Particle (ABP) and RL agent over an identical range of $D_r$, we find that RL trajectories are shorter, less noisy, and consistently faster. Our results show that cost-driven learning, stochastic reorientation, and inter-agent interactions enable efficient adaptive navigation, linking individual and collective homing. This reinforcement learning framework captures key biological features such as feedback-based route learning, randomness to escape unfavorable orientations, and mutual coordination.</description>

      <title>GraphAgents: Knowledge Graph-Guided Agentic AI for Cross-Domain Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.</description>

      <title>Fast Jacobi Spectral Methods and Closure Approximations for the Homogeneous FENE Model of Complex Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic (FENE) dumbbell model is a widely used mathematical model for complex fluids. Direct simulation of the FENE Fokker--Planck equation is computationally challenging due to high dimensionality and singularity of its potential. In this paper, we develop two fast Jacobi-Spherical Harmonic spectral methods for the spatially homogeneous FENE Fokker--Planck equation. These methods effectively resolve the singularity near the boundary by combining properly designed Jacobi polynomials with a weighted variational formulation. A semi-implicit backward differentiation formula of second-order (BDF2) is employed for time marching, and its energy stability is rigorously proved. The resulting linear algebraic system possesses a sparse structure and can be efficiently solved. Numerical results verify the spectral convergence and efficiency of the direct spectral solvers, establishing them as a reliable tool for generating reference solutions for challenging benchmark problems. Furthermore, to achieve an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we compare several closure approximation models, including the industry workhorse Peterlin approximation (FENE-P), the quasi-equilibrium approximation (FENE-QE), and a novel neural network implementation for FENE-QE proposed in this paper (FENE-QE-NN). Numerical experiments in extensional and shear flows demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>dewi-kadita: A Python Library for Idealized Fish Schooling Simulation with Entropy-Based Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective motion in fish schools exemplifies emergent self-organization in active matter systems, yet computational tools for simulating and analyzing these dynamics remain fragmented across research groups. We present dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library implementing the three-dimensional Couzin zone-based model with comprehensive entropy diagnostics tailored for marine collective behavior research. The library introduces seven information-theoretic metrics -- school cohesion entropy, polarization entropy, depth stratification entropy, angular momentum entropy, nearest-neighbor entropy, velocity correlation entropy, and school shape entropy -- that characterize distinct organizational features inaccessible to classical order parameters. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) providing a single scalar measure of collective disorder. Validation across four canonical configurations (swarm, torus, dynamic parallel, highly parallel) confirms correct reproduction of known phase behaviors: the swarm maintains disorder with polarization $P &lt; 0.1$ and OSI $\approx 0.71$, while the highly parallel state achieves $P = 0.998$ with OSI $= 0.24$ and velocity correlation entropy vanishing to zero. The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms. Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation accelerates pairwise interaction calculations by $10$--$100\times$, enabling simulations of $150$--$250$ agents over $1000$--$2000$ time steps within five minutes on standard workstation hardware.

      <title>High-resolution numerical simulations of turbulent non-catalytic reverse water gas shift</title>

Abstract: A green transition in aviation requires a drastic upscaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The power-to-liquid process for the production of CO2-neutral jet fuel via electricity, called e-SAF, directly replaces fossil jet fuel without having to change infrastructure, aeroplanes, or jet-engines. The process combines green hydrogen with industrial exhaust gas, or captured carbon dioxide, in a circular economy concept. A key element of the e-SAF production plant is the reactor where syngas is produced. Traditional reactors use catalytic technology, which faces severe challenges due to the reduced performance over time because of catalyst degradation, clogging, and breakup due to embrittlement. A high-potential alternative is the catalyst-free reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reactor concept.
  The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the fundamental aspects of the catalyst-free RWGS process, such as reaction kinetics and the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The secondary aim is to identify how a typical combustion subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) perform when the chemical reactions are endothermic, in contrast to the strong endothermicity associated with classical combustion.
  It is found that even small traces of O2 in the CO2 stream can significantly increase the production rate of CO. This is attributed to the increased pool of OH. The effect is strongest at atmospheric pressure and less pronounced at higher pressure. By using the temporal jet framework to study turbulence-chemistry interactions, an algebraic equation for the prediction of the CO conversion time in a turbulent flow as a function of Damkohler number and chemical timescale is employed. Finally, it is concluded that the PaSR LES subgrid model designed for combustion reactions perform well also for the endothermic reverse water-gas-shift reaction.</description>

      <title>Exact Stationary State of a $d$-dimensional Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Harmonic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the exact nonequilibrium steady state of a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in $d$ dimensions confined in an isotropic harmonic trap $V(\mathbf r)=\mu r^{2}/2$, with $r=\|\mathbf r\|$. Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/\mu$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D&gt;0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \to 0$ and $D \to \infty$ respectively. All analytical predictions are systematically validated against numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Cell strain-stiffening drives cell breakout from embedded spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how cells escape from embedded spheroids requires a mechanical framework linking stress generation within cells, across cells, and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We develop such a framework by coupling a 3D vertex model of a spheroid to a fibrous ECM network and deriving a 3D Cauchy stress tensor for deformable polyhedral cells, enabling direct cell-level stress quantification in three dimensions. We analyze maximum shear stress in solid-like and fluid-like spheroids: solid-like spheroids exhibit broader stress distributions and radial stress gradients, while fluid-like spheroids show lower stresses with weak spatial organization. Cell shape anisotropy is not generically aligned with principal stress directions, indicating that morphology alone is an unreliable proxy for mechanical state. We further demonstrate strain stiffening at the single-cell level, where elongation produces nonlinear increases in maximum shear stress, allowing boundary cells in otherwise low-stress, fluid-like spheroids to transiently generate forces sufficient to remodel the matrix. To connect strain-induced stress amplification to invasion modes, we introduce an extended 3D vertex model with explicit, tunable cell-cell adhesion springs. In this minimal mechanical framework, single-cell breakout results from strain stiffening combined with reduced adhesion, whereas multi-cell streaming additionally requires anisotropic adhesion strengthened along the elongation axis and weakened orthogonally. Together, these results identify distinct mechanical pathways coupling cell strain, stress amplification, and adhesion organization to spheroid invasion.</description>

      <title>A Stabilized Diffuse-Interface Electroporation Model with a Semi-Analytical Spectral Electrolyte Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:1611.03902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a diffuse-interface continuum model for membrane electroporation that couples a phase field for pore geometry to a quasi-static electrolyte potential and a spatially varying leaky-dielectric model for the transmembrane voltage. The main contribution is a stabilized time-integration strategy for transmembrane voltage $V_m$: the stiff leakage term is treated implicitly while the electrolyte-to-membrane ionic current is lagged, yielding a closed-form update that removes the restriction imposed by the fast dielectric relaxation time. The electrolyte potential is computed efficiently using a semi-analytical spectral Laplace solver: a 2D DCT in the membrane plane reduces the 3D problem to independent 1D ODEs in $z$, solved in closed form and reconstructed by an inverse transform. The coupled method is robust under grid refinement, reproduces the sharp-interface critical-radius bifurcation, and captures electric-field focusing through conductive pores. We also demonstrate stochastic pore nucleation by adding thermal noise to the phase-field dynamics, enabling fully emergent electroporation events without prescribing initial defects.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for velocity profile of granular flow in rotating drums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically and numerically investigate the steady flow of two-dimensional granular materials in a rotating drum using the discrete element method and a continuum model with the $\mu(I)$-rheology. The velocity fields obtained from both methods are in quantitative agreement. The granular flow exhibits two distinct regions: a surface flow layer and a static flow regime corresponding to rigid rotation near the drum bottom. The thickness of the surface flow layer increases with the drum diameter and shows a weak dependence on the angular velocity of the drum. Using dimensional analysis of the continuum equations, we analytically identify nondimensional parameters for the velocity profile and the surface flow layer thickness, which lead to scaling laws characterising the flow in rotating drums with low Froude number and large system size. The validity of the scaling laws is confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Critical fluctuations of elastic moduli in jammed solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate sample-to-sample fluctuations of the shear modulus in ensembles of particle packings near the jamming transition. Unlike the average modulus, which exhibits distinct scaling behaviours depending on the interparticle potential, the fluctuations obey a critical exponent that is independent of the potential. Furthermore, this scaling behaviour has been confirmed in two-dimensional packings, indicating that it holds regardless of spatial dimension. Using this scaling law, we discuss the relationship predicted by heterogeneous-elasticity theory between elastic-modulus fluctuations and the Rayleigh scattering of sound waves across different pressures. Our numerical results provide a useful foundation for developing a unified theoretical description of the jamming critical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled filament layers in drying sessile droplets: from morphology to electrical conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the deposition of filaments, such as nanowires and nanotubes, from evaporating droplets is critical for the performance of emerging technologies like flexible sensors and printed electronics. The final deposit morphology strongly governs functional properties, such as electrical conductivity, yet remains challenging to control. In this work, we numerically investigate how filament length, stiffness, and concentration affect deposition patterns during the drying process. We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics.</description>

      <title>Elastoplastic Modelling of Cyclic Shear Deformation of Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an energy-landscape based elasto-plastic model to understand the behaviour of amorphous solids under uniform and cyclic shear. Amorphous solids are modeled as being composed of mesoscopic sub-volumes, each of which may occupy states - termed mesostates -- drawn from a specified distribution. The energies of the mesostates under stress free conditions determine their stability range with respect to applied strain, and their plastic strain, at which they are stress free, forms an important additional property. Under applied global strain, mesostates that reach their stability limits transition to other permissible mesostates. Barring such transitions, which encompass plastic deformations that the solid may undergo, mesostates are treated as exhibiting linear elastic behavior, and the interactions between mesoscopic blocks are treated using the finite element method. The model reproduces known phenomena under uniform and cyclic shear, such as the brittle-to-ductile crossover with annealing and the Bauschinger effect for uniform shear, qualitative features of the yielding diagram under cyclic shear including the change in yielding behaviour with the degree of annealing, across a `threshold level', and dynamic phenomena such as the divergence of failure times on approach to the yield point and the non-monotonic evolution of the local yield rate. In addition to these results, we discuss the dependence of the observed behaviour on model choices, and open questions highlighted by our work.</description>

      <title>Information bounds the robustness of self-organized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-organized systems, from synthetic nanostructures to developing organisms, are composed of fluctuating units capable of forming robust functional structures despite noise. Here, we ask: are there fundamental bounds on the robustness of noisy self-organized systems? By viewing self-organization as noisy encoding, we prove that the positional information capacity of short-range classical systems with discrete states obeys a bound reminiscent of area laws for quantum information. We illustrate this principle with lattice models whose dynamics is captured by continuum models derived using exact coarse-graining techniques and validated through Dynamical Renormalization Group calculations. The universal bound is saturated by fine-tuning transport coefficients, which can be rationalized in the continuum limit upon considering the effects of boundaries on domain wall dynamics. We illustrate how this limit can be bypassed when long-range correlations are present by investigating a wave-pinning model motivated by biological mechanisms. In this class of models, global constraints reduce the need for fine-tuning by providing effective integral feedback. Our work identifies fundamental limits for the ability of natural and synthetic microsystems to self-assemble into patterns and rationalizes them on purely information-theoretic grounds.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of committor for ion dissociation and interpretable analysis of solvent effects using atom-centered symmetry functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.</description>
