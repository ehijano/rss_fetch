      <title>Central limit theory for Peaks-over-Threshold partial sums of long memory linear time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last 30 years, extensive work has been devoted to developing central limit theory for partial sums of subordinated long memory linear time series. A much less studied problem, motivated by questions that are ubiquitous in extreme value theory, is the asymptotic behavior of such partial sums when the subordination mechanism has a threshold depending on sample size, so as to focus on the right tail of the time series. This article substantially extends longstanding asymptotic techniques by allowing the subordination mechanism to depend on the sample size in this way and to grow at a polynomial rate, while permitting the innovation process to have infinite variance. The cornerstone of our theoretical approach is a tailored $L^r(\mathbf{P})$ reduction principle, which enables the use of classical results on partial sums of long memory linear processes. In this way we obtain asymptotic theory for certain Peaks-over-Threshold estimators with deterministic or random thresholds. Applications comprise both the heavy- and light-tailed regimes -- yielding unexpected results which, to the best of our knowledge, are new to the literature.</description>

      <title>The Urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some facts, properties and applications of the urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth, a paradigmatic model of stochastic process with memory, where the urn evolution is as follows: consider an urn of given capacity, at each step a new ball, black or white, is added to the urn with probability that is function (urn function) of the fraction of black balls. The process runs until capacity is reached.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy between two independent samples \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) and \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\) drawn from the same distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ typically has order \(O(\sqrt{n})\) even in one dimension. We give a simple online algorithm that reduces the discrepancy to \(O(\log^{2d} n)\) by discarding a small fraction of the points.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Stationary Distributions of Interacting Dynamical Systems and their approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{BCP}, the authors built and studied an algorithm based on the (self)-interaction of a dynamics with its occupation measure to approximate Quasi-Stationary Distributions (QSD) of general Markov chains conditioned to stay in a compact set. In this paper, we propose to tackle the case of McKean-Vlasov-type dynamics, \emph{i.e.} of dynamics interacting with their marginal distribution (conditioned to not be killed). In this non-linear setting, we are able to exhibit some conditions which guarantee that weak limits of these sequences of random measures are QSDs of the given dynamics. We also prove tightness results in the non-compact case. These general conditions are then applied to Euler schemes of McKean-Vlasov SDEs and in the compact case, the behavior of these QSDs when the step $h$ goes to $0$ is investigated. Our results also allow to consider some examples in the non-compact case and some new tightness criterions are also provided in this setting. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with several simulations.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous blowup for interacting SDEs with superlinear drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting SDEs on the integer lattice with multiplicative noise and a drift satisfying the finite Osgood's condition. We show the instantaneous everywhere blowup for the constant initial profile. We employ the splitting-up method to compare the interacting system to a one-dimensional SDE which blows up.</description>

      <title>The Markov property for $\varphi^4_3$ on the cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the $\varphi^4_3$ model satisfies a version of Segal's axioms in the special case of three-dimensional tori and cylinders. As a consequence, we give the first proof that this model satisfies a Markov property and we characterize its boundary law up to absolutely continuous perturbations. In addition, we use Segal's axioms to give an alternative construction of the $\varphi^4_3$ Hamiltonian on two-dimensional tori as compared with Glimm (Comm. Math. Phys., 1968). We exploit this probabilistic approach to prove novel fundamental spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, such as discrete spectrum and a Perron-Froebenius type result on its ground state. The key technical contributions of this article are the development of tools to analyze $\varphi^4_3$ models with rough boundary conditions. We heavily use the variational approach to $\varphi^4_3$ models introduced in Barashkov and Gubinelli (Duke, 2020) that is based on the Bou\'e-Dupuis formula and dual to Polchinski's continuous renormalization group.</description>

      <title>On the visibility window for Brownian interlacements, Poisson cylinders and Boolean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study visibility inside the vacant set of three models in $\mathbb R^d$ with slow decay of spatial correlations: Brownian interlacements, Poisson cylinders and Poisson-Boolean models. Let $Q_x$ be the radius of the largest ball centered at $x$ every point of which is visible from $0$ through the vacant set of one of these models. We prove that conditioned on $x$ being visible from $0$, $Q_x/\delta_{\|x\|}$ converges weakly, as $x\to\infty$, to the exponential distribution with an explicit intensity, which depends on the parameters of the respective model. The scaling function $\delta_r$ is the visibility window introduced in arXiv:2304.10298, a length scale of correlations in the visible set at distance $r$ from $0$.</description>

      <title>Kac-Rice inspired approach to non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) of non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The method, which represents an alternative to Girko Hermitization approach, is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we apply it to consider two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we discuss the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a possible generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Multi-agent Learning Dynamics in Finite-state Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable, deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation of the framework is available at\,: https://github.com/yannKerzreho/MarkovGameApproximation</description>

      <title>RSB bounds on the maximum cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of random regular graphs, the size of the maximum cut is probably the second most studied graph parameter after the independence ratio. Zdeborov\'a and Boettcher used the cavity method, a non-rigorous statistical physics technique, to predict one-step replica symmetry breaking (1-RSB) formulas. Coja-Ohglan et al. confirmed these predictions as rigorous upper bounds using the interpolation method. While these upper bounds were not expected to be exact, they may be very close to the true values.
  In this paper, we establish 2-RSB upper bounds and fine-tune their parameters to beat the aforementioned 1-RSB bounds.</description>

      <title>Succinct Preferential Attachment Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing over compressed data combines the space saving of data compression with efficient support for queries directly on the compressed representation. Such data structures are widely applied in text indexing and have been successfully generalised to trees. For graphs, support for computing over compressed data remains patchy; typical results in the area of succinct data structures are restricted to a specific class of graphs and use the same, worst-case amount of space for any graph from this class.
  In this work, we design a data structure whose space usage automatically improves with the compressibility of the graph at hand, while efficiently supporting navigational operations (simulating adjacency-list access). Specifically, we show that the space usage approaches the instance-optimal space when the graph is drawn according to the classic Barab\'asi-Albert model of preferential-attachment graphs. Our data-structure techniques also work for arbitrary graphs, guaranteeing a size asymptotically no larger than an entropy-compressed edge list. A key technical contribution is the careful analysis of the instance-optimal space usage.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Detection of Empty Space: Conditional Marked Point Processes for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However, these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics. Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of performance.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Inference for Exchangeable Gibbs Partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of parameter estimation and predictive inference under the exchangeable Gibbs partition, characterized by a discount parameter $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and a triangular array $v_{n,k}$ satisfying a backward recursion. Assuming that $v_{n,k}$ admits a mixture representation over the Ewens--Pitman family $(\alpha, \theta)$, with $\theta$ integrated by an unknown mixing distribution, we show that the (quasi) maximum likelihood estimator $\hat\alpha_n$ (QMLE) for $\alpha$ is asymptotically mixed normal. This generalizes earlier results for the Ewens--Pitman model to a more general class. We further study the predictive task of estimating the probability simplex $\mathsf{p}_n$, which governs the allocation of the $(n+1)$-th item, conditional on the current partition of $[n]$. Based on the asymptotics of the QMLE $\hat{\alpha}_n$, we construct an estimator $\hat{\mathsf{p}}_n$ and derive the limit distributions of the $f$-divergence $\mathsf{D}_f(\hat{\mathsf{p}}_n||\mathsf{p}_n)$ for general convex functions $f$, including explicit results for the TV distance and KL divergence. These results lead to asymptotically valid confidence intervals for both parameter estimation and prediction.</description>

      <title>Detecting weighted hidden cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the classical hidden clique problem to graphs with real-valued edge weights. Formally, we define a hypothesis testing problem. Under the null hypothesis, edges of a complete graph on $n$ vertices are associated with independent and identically distributed edge weights from a distribution $P$. Under the alternate hypothesis, $k$ vertices are chosen at random and the edge weights between them are drawn from a distribution $Q$, while the remaining are sampled from $P$. The goal is to decide, upon observing the edge weights, which of the two hypotheses they were generated from. We investigate the problem under two different scenarios: (1) when $P$ and $Q$ are completely known, and (2) when there is only partial information of $P$ and $Q$. In the first scenario, we obtain statistical limits on $k$ when the two hypotheses are distinguishable, and when they are not. Additionally, in each of the scenarios, we provide bounds on the minimal risk of the hypothesis testing problem when $Q$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $P$. We also provide computationally efficient spectral tests that can distinguish the two hypotheses as long as $k=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ in both the scenarios.</description>

      <title>Kesten's incipient infinite cluster for the three-dimensional, metric-graph Gaussian free field, from critical level-set percolation, and for the Villain model, from random cluster geometries and a Swendsen-Wang type algorithm</title>

Abstract: We address one open problem in a recent work due to Ding and Wirth, the first version of which was available in $2019$, relating to level-set percolation on metric-graphs for the Gaussian free field in three dimensions, in which it was shown that a percolation estimate that the authors employ for studying connectivity properties of different heights of the metric graph Gaussian free field is bounded above poly-logarithmically. In three dimensions, in order to construct Kesten's incipient infinite cluster which was first seminally introduced for Bernoulli percolation in two dimensions, in $1986$, through the equality of two probabilistic quantities, we make use of a streamlined version of the $1986$ argument due to Basu and Sapozhnikov, which was first made available in $2016$, that introduces properties of crossing probabilities for demonstrating that the IIC exists for Bernoulli percolation on an infinite connected, bounded degree graph. To make use of such arguments for demonstrating the existence of the metric-graph GFF IIC in three dimensions, we also address another open problem raised in a recent work, from October $2022$, due to Dubedat and Falconet, which expresses an open problem pertaining to the construction of an IIC-type limit for the Villain model.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of the long range Ising model in lower dimensions, for $d &lt; \alpha \leq d + 1$, with a Peierls argument</title>

Abstract: We extend previous results due to Ding and Zhuang in order to prove that a phase transition occurs for the long range Ising model in lower dimensions. By making use of a recent argument due to Affonso, Bissacot and Maia from 2022 which establishes that a phase transition occurs for the long range, random-field Ising model, from a suggestion of the authors we demonstrate that a phase transition also occurs for the long range Ising model, from a set of appropriately defined contours for the long range system, and a Peierls' argument.</description>

      <title>On Iterated Lorenz Curves with Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13183v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a Lorenz curve, derived from the distribution function of a random variable, can itself be viewed as a probability distribution function of a new random variable (Arnold, 2015). We prove the surprising result that a sequence of consecutive iterations of this map leads to a non-corner case convergence, independent of the initial random variable. In the primal case, both the limiting distribution and its parent follow a power-law distribution with exponent equal to the golden section. In the reflected case, the limiting distribution is the Kumaraswamy distribution with a conjugate value of the exponent, while the parent distribution is the classical Pareto distribution. Potential applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Euler Scheme for Fractional Stochastic Delay Differential Equations with Additive Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Euler-Maruyama scheme for a class ofstochastic delay differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion with index $H\in(0,1)$. We establish the consistency of the scheme and study the rate of convergence of the normalized error process. This is done by checking that the generic rate of convergence of the error process with stepsize $\Delta_{n}$ is $\Delta_{n}^{\min\{H+\frac{1}{2},3H,1\}}$. It turned out that such a rate is suboptimal when the delay is smooth and $H&gt;1/2$. In this context, and in contrast to the non-delayed framework, we show that a convergence of order $H+1/2$ is achievable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploiting the explicit bijection between the density of singular values and the density of eigenvalues for bi-unitarily invariant complex random matrix ensembles of finite matrix size, we aim at finding the induced probability measure on $j$ eigenvalues and $k$ singular values that we coin $j,k$-point correlation measure. We find an expression for the $1,k$-point correlation measure which simplifies drastically when assuming that the singular values follow a polynomial ensemble, yielding a closed formula in terms of the kernel corresponding to the determinantal point process of the singular value statistics. These expressions simplify even further when the singular values are drawn from a P\'{o}lya ensemble and extend known results between the eigenvalue and singular value statistics of the corresponding bi-unitarily invariant ensemble.</description>

Abstract: We consider the second class particle in half-line open TASEP under two different initial conditions with shock discontinuities. The exact formulas for the distribution of the second class particle can be derived by using the color-position symmetry theorem of colored half-space TASEP. We study the asymptotic distribution of second class particles under the constant scaling and KPZ-type scaling.</description>

      <title>On the robustness of semi-discrete optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the breakdown point for solutions of semi-discrete optimal transport problems, which characterizes the robustness of the multivariate quantiles based on optimal transport proposed in \cite{GS}. We do so under very mild assumptions: the absolutely continuous reference measure is only assumed to have a support that is \textcolor{mygreen}{convex}, whereas the target measure is a general discrete measure on a finite number, $n$ say, of atoms. The breakdown point depends on the target measure only through its probability weights (hence not on the location of the atoms) and involves the geometry of the reference measure through the \cite{Tuk1975} concept of halfspace depth. Remarkably, depending on this geometry, the breakdown point of the optimal transport median can be strictly smaller than the breakdown point of the univariate median or the breakdown point of the spatial median, namely~$\lceil n/2\rceil /2$. In the context of robust location estimation, our results provide a subtle insight on how to perform multivariate trimming when constructing trimmed means based on optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rough stochastic differential equations (RSDEs) are common generalisations
  of Ito SDEs and Lyons RDEs and have emerged as new tool in several areas
  of applied probability, including non-linear stochastic filtering, pathwise
  stochastic optimal control, volatility modelling in finance and mean-fields
  analysis of common noise system.
  We here take a unified perspective on rough Ito processes and discuss in
  particular when and how they become, upon randomisation, "doubly
  stochastic" Ito processes, and what can be said about their conditional laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to define a Boolean entropy notion parallel to the framework of free entropy proposed by Voiculescu. Motivated by the work of Lenczewski and the work of C\'ebron &amp; Gillers, we mainly investigated two random matrix models (the Gaussian Symmetric Block model and the Conditioned GUE model), in which asymptotic Boolean independence appears. We showed a large deviation principle for both models. As a result, the two rate functions coincide up to scaling and are minimized by the Rademacher distribution. Therefore, we refer to the logarithmic integral in the rate function as Boolean entropy. Finally, we proved this logarithmic integral is maximized by the Rademacher distribution and monotone along the Boolean Central Limit Theorem.</description>

Abstract: We extend previous results providing an exact formula for the variance of a linear statistic for the Jellium model, a one-dimensional model of Statistical mechanics obtained from the $k \longrightarrow 0^{+}$ limit of the Dyson log-gas. For such a computation of the covariance, in comparison to previous work for computations of the log-gas covariance, we obtain a formula between two linear statistics, given arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$ over the real line, that is dependent upon an asymptotic approximation of the Jellium probability distribution function from large $N$ deviations, and from an effective saddle-point action.</description>

Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer, let $0&lt;p\leqslant p'\leqslant \frac{1}{2}$, and let $\ell \leqslant pn$ be a nonnegative integer. We prove that if $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ are two families whose cross intersections forbid $\ell$ -- that is, they satisfy $|A\cap B|\neq \ell$ for every $A\in\mathcal{F}$ and every $B\in\mathcal{G}$ -- then, setting $t:=\min\{\ell,pn-\ell\}$, we have the subgaussian bound \[ \mu_p(\mathcal{F})\, \mu_{p'}(\mathcal{G})\leqslant 2\exp\Big( - \frac{t^2}{58^2\,pn}\Big), \] where $\mu_p$ and $\mu_{p'}$ denote the $p$-biased and $p'$-biased measures on $\{0,1\}^n$ respectively.</description>

Abstract: We prove fundamental properties of empirical measures induced by measurements performed on quantum $N$-body systems. More precisely, we consider measurements performed on the ground state of an interacting, trapped Bose gase in the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, known to exhibit Bose--Einstein condensation. For the corresponding empirical measure, we prove a weak law of large numbers with limit induced by the condensate wave function and characterize the fluctuations around through an appropriate central limit theorem.</description>

Abstract: We study the emptiness formation probability, along with various representations for nonlocal correlation functions, of the 20-vertex model. In doing so, we leverage previous arguments for representations of nonlocal correlation functions for the 6-vertex model, under domain-wall boundary conditions, due to Colomo, Di Giulio, and Pronko, in addition to the inhomogeneous, and homogeneous, determinantal representations for the 20-vertex partition function due to Di Francesco, also under domain-wall boundary conditions. By taking a product of row configuration probabilities, we obtain a desired contour integral representation for nonlocal correlations from a determinantal representation. Finally, a counterpart of the emptiness formation probability is introduced for the 20-vertex model.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure of the 4-vertex model, and the higher-spin XXX chain, and Yang-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement the quantum inverse scattering method for the 4-vertex model. In comparison to previous works of the author which examined the 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, the 4-vertex model exhibits different characteristics, ranging from L-operators expressed in terms of projectors and Pauli matrices to algebraic and combinatorial properties, including Poisson structure and boxed plane partitions. With far fewer computations with an L-operator provided for the 4-vertex model by Bogoliubov in 2007, in comparison to those for L-operators of the 6, and 20, vertex models, from lower order expansions of the transfer matrix we derive a system of relations from the structure of operators that can be leveraged for studying characteristics of the higher-spin XXX chain in the weak finite volume limit. In comparison to quantum inverse scattering methods for the 6, and 20, vertex models which can be used to further study integrability, and exact solvability, an adaptation of such an approach for the 4-vertex model can be used to approximate, asymptotically in the weak finite volume limit, sixteen brackets which generate the Poisson structure. From explicit relations for operators of the 4-vertex transfer matrix, we conclude by discussing corresponding aspects of the Yang-Baxter algebra, which is closely related to the operators obtained from products of L-operators for approximating the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices. The structure of computations from L-operators of the 4-vertex model directly transfers to L-operators of the higher-spin XXX chain, revealing a similar structure of another Yang-Baxter algebra of interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general partially observed diffusion model with periodic coefficients and with non-degenerate diffusion component. The coefficients of such a model depend on an unknown (static and deterministic) parameter which needs to be estimated based on the observed component of the diffusion process. We show that, given enough regularity of the diffusion coefficients, a maximum likelihood estimator of the unknown parameter converges to the true parameter value as the sample size grows to infinity.</description>

      <title>Intertwining vectors, and Boltzmann weight matrices, of a Solid-on-Solid model from the 20-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a new study on the correspondence between the 20-vertex model and a SOS (Solid-on-Solid) model. In comparison to two previous works of the author in 2024 which characterized properties of the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices of the 20-vertex model from the perspective of the quantum inverse scattering method, in addition to the structure of nonlocal correlations, the forthcoming approach is an adaptation of a study on the rational 7-vertex model. For the rational 7-vertex model, Antoenneko and Valinevich demonstrated that the intertwining vectors can be used to transform the R-matrix of a vertex model into the Boltzman weight matrix of an SOS model. To further develop perspectives on classes of higher dimensional SOS models, by leveraging previous computations with L-operators due to the author, and by also manipulating q-exponentials, and other related factors from a factorization of the universal R-matrix due to Boos et al, analogs of intertwining vectors for the 20- vertex model can be obtained. In comparison to the system of equations that have been obtained for the rational 7-vertex model, the system that one obtains for the 20-vertex model consists of 9 equations for each entry of the R-matrix. Furthermore, from the fact that the 20-vertex model contains more possible configurations in the sample space than the rational 7-vertex model does, the Boltzman weight matrix of the corresponding SOS model asymptotically depends upon several contributions, a few of which include tensor products of basis elements, and spectral parameters over the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Index Policy for Restless Bandits with Average Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Lagrange Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement learning schemes for LIP require significantly less memory than the analogous schemes for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrange index for the restart model, which applies to the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality in case of homogeneous arms as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.</description>

      <title>No-prior Bayesian inference reIMagined: probabilistic approximations of inferential models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19748</link>

Abstract: When prior information is lacking, the go-to strategy for probabilistic inference is to combine a "default prior" and the likelihood via Bayes's theorem. Objective Bayes, (generalized) fiducial inference, etc. fall under this umbrella. This construction is natural, but the corresponding posterior distributions generally only offer limited, approximately valid uncertainty quantification. The present paper takes a reimagined approach offering posterior distributions with stronger reliability properties. The proposed construction starts with an inferential model (IM), one that takes the mathematical form of a data-driven possibility measure and features exactly valid uncertainty quantification, and then returns a so-called inner probabilistic approximation thereof. This inner probabilistic approximation inherits many of the original IM's desirable properties, including credible sets with exact coverage and asymptotic efficiency. The approximation also agrees with the familiar Bayes/fiducial solution obtained in applications where the model has a group transformation structure. A Monte Carlo method for evaluating the probabilistic approximation is presented, along with numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Quantum strategies, error bounds, optimality, and duality gaps for multiplayer XOR, $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled XOR, $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetiton of XOR, $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and FFL games</title>

Abstract: We characterize exact, and approximate, optimality of games that players can interact with using quantum strategies. In comparison to a previous work of the author, arXiv: 2311.12887, which applied a 2016 framework due to Ostrev for constructing error bounds beyond CHSH and XOR games, in addition to the existence of well-posed semidefinite programs for determining primal feasible solutions, along with quantum-classical duality gaps, it continues to remain of interest to further develop the construction of error bounds, and related objects, to game-theoretic settings with several participants. In such settings, one encounters a rich information theoretic landscape, not only from the fact that there exists a significantly larger combinatorial space of possible strategies for each player, but also several opportunities for pronounced quantum advantage. We conclude this effort by describing other variants of other possible strategies, as proposed sources for quantum advantage, in $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetition variants of $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ games.</description>

      <title>A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional PDMPs.</description>

      <title>Finding long cycles in a percolated expander graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the percolated graph $G_p$ has each edge independently retained with probability $p$. Collares, Diskin, Erde, and Krivelevich initiated the study of large structures in percolated single-scale vertex expander graphs, wherein every set of exactly $k$ vertices of $G$ has at least $dk$ neighbours before percolation. We extend their result to a conjectured stronger form, proving that if $p = (1+\varepsilon)/d$ and $G$ is a graph on at least $k$ vertices which expands as above, then $G_p$ contains a cycle of length $\Omega_\varepsilon(kd)$ with probability at least $1-\exp(-\Omega_\varepsilon(k/d))$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$.</description>
