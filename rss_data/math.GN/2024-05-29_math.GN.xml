      <title>A Ramsey theorem for the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every colouring of pairs of reals with finitely-many colours, there is a set homeomorphic to the rationals which takes no more than two colours. This was conjectured by Galvin in 1970, and a colouring of Sierpi{\'n}ski from 1933 witnesses that the number of colours cannot be reduced to one. Previously in 1985 Shelah had shown that a stronger statement is consistent with a forcing construction assuming the existence of large cardinals. Then in 2018 Raghavan and Todor\v{c}evi\'c had proved it assuming the existence of large cardinals. We prove it in $ZFC$. In fact Raghavan and Todor\v{c}evi\'c proved, assuming more large cardinals, a similar result for a large class of topological spaces. We prove this also, again in $ZFC$.</description>

      <title>Towards solid abelian groups: A formal proof of N\"obeling's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, is a new way of studying the interplay between algebra and geometry. It replaces the concept of a topological space by a more sophisticated but better-behaved idea, namely that of a condensed set. Central to the theory are solid abelian groups and liquid vector spaces, analogues of complete topological groups.
  N\"obeling's theorem, a surprising result from the 1960s about the structure of the abelian group of continuous maps from a profinite space to the integers, is a crucial ingredient in the theory of solid abelian groups; without it one cannot give any nonzero examples of solid abelian groups. We discuss a recently completed formalisation of this result in the Lean theorem prover, and give a more detailed proof than those previously available in the literature. The proof is somewhat unusual in that it requires induction over ordinals -- a technique which has not previously been used to a great extent in formalised mathematics.</description>
