      <title>Josephson Oscillation and Nonlinear Self-Trapping in Quasi-one-dimensional Quantum Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the two-mode method to analyze the Josephson oscillation for a trapped binary Bose-Einstein condensate while taking into account the beyond mean-field and three body interactions. For this purpose, we use the archetypal model of double well potential and study the Josephson oscillation and self-trapping phases in quasi-one dimension. Additionally, our analysis provides quantitative discussion on the effect of asymmetry and dimension. We further corroborate our findings with Bogoliubov quasi-particle method and notice regions of instabilities and roton like mode.</description>

      <title>Geometry-driven splitting dynamics of a triply quantized vortex in a ring-shaped condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the splitting dynamics of a triply quantized vortex (TQV) confined in a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate under a weakly elliptical harmonic trap. Using full 3D simulations in cylindrical coordinates, combined with a semi-analytical energy analysis, we show that the vortex preferentially splits along the long axis of the trap, a direction that minimizes the kinetic-energy cost relative to the initial TQV state. Systematic parameter scans reveal that initial quantum fluctuations increase the splitting time and suppress the transient three-core pattern observed in noise-free simulations, whereas stronger nonlinear interactions accelerate the splitting. When the trap is nearly isotropic, the unstable Bogoliubov modes are dominated by both azimuthal quantum number $l_q=3$ and $l_q=2$; this leads to a dynamical sequence where three daughter vortices first form a triangular arrangement, later evolving into a linear chain. For stronger anisotropy, geometric coupling selectively enhances the $l_q=2$ mode, making it the sole dominant channel and resulting directly in linear vortex alignment -- a clear signature of geometry-induced mode competition explained through combined energy-based and Bogoliubov stability analysis. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how trap geometry can steer the instability pathway, splitting time, and final pattern of a multiply quantized vortex, offering a route toward geometry-controlled vortex engineering.</description>

      <title>Phase Dynamics of Self-Accelerating Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-accelerating Airy matter waves offer a clean setting to access the cubic Kennard phase. Here we reconstruct the relative phase of simulated Airy-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates in free space, a regime approached in microgravity, from interference fringes. The cubic phase dynamics are quantified via windowed polynomial fits with systematics-aware uncertainty estimates that account for window-induced correlations. We compare two experimentally feasible phase-extraction methods - heterodyne-based and density-based - and show that an Airy-Gaussian geometry yields substantially improved robustness to fit-window selection relative to an Airy-Airy collision. In the weakly interacting regime, the extracted cubic coefficient responds linearly to the effective one-dimensional interaction strength. Our approach turns cubic phase dynamics into a practical probe of weak mean-field nonlinearities in self-accelerating condensates.</description>

      <title>Excitations and anisotropic sound in planar dipolar supersolids with tilted dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collective excitations of anisotropic dipolar supersolids in planar confinement, focusing on triangular and stripe phases in situations where the dipoles are titled to have a component in the plane. Using Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations and hydrodynamic theory, we identify the elastic parameters that govern the long-wavelength dynamics, including two orientational coefficients that capture the broken rotational symmetry induced by dipole tilt. Analytical expressions for the speeds of sound are obtained along the principal axes for triangular supersolids and along any propagation direction for the stripe supersolid. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding sound propagation in anisotropic dipolar supersolids and establish connections to recent experiments on sound propagation in striped Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortex channels as Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum gases, weak links are typically realized with externally imposed optical potentials. We show that, in rotating binary condensates, quantized vortices in one component form hollow channels that act as self-induced weak links for the other, enabling superflow through otherwise impenetrable, phase-separated domains. This introduces a novel barrier mechanism: quantum pressure creates an effective barrier inside the vortex channel, set by the constriction width, which controls the superflow. Tuning the interspecies interaction strength drives a crossover from the hydrodynamic transport to Josephson tunneling regime. Long-range dipolar interactions further tune the weak-link properties, enabling both short links and two coupled junctions in series. Circuit models quantitatively capture the dc current-phase relations for both configurations. These results establish vortices as reconfigurable, interaction-controlled Josephson elements in superfluids.</description>

      <title>Strong Correlations in the Dynamical Evolution of Lowest Landau Level Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments with rotating Bose gases have demonstrated the interaction-driven hydrodynamic instability of an initial extended strip-like state in the lowest Landau level. We investigate this phenomenon in the low density limit, where the mean-field Gross--Pitaevskii theory becomes inadequate, using exact diagonalisation studies and analytic arguments. We show that the behaviour can be understood in terms of weakly-interacting repulsively-bound few-body clusters. Signatures of cluster behaviour are observed in the expectation values of observables which oscillate at frequencies characterised by the energies of few-body boundstates. Using a semiclassical theory for interacting clusters, we predict the long-time growth of the cloud width to be a power law in the logarithm of time. This slow thermalisation of bound clusters represents a form of quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity Induced Fractional Nonlinear Thouless Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interest has surged in eigenvalue's nonlinearity-based topological transport governed by the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues $H\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$ [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024); C. Bai and Z. Liang, 111, 042201 (2025); Phys. Rev. A 112, 052207 (2025)] rather than the conventional Schrodinger equation $H\Psi=E\Psi$ in conservative settings, yet non-Hermitian generalizations remain uncharted. In this work, we are motivated to investigate the nonlinear Thouless pumping in a non-Hermitian and nonlinear Rice-Mele model. In particular, we uncover how non-Hermiticity parameters can induce fractional topological phases--even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the framework of the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in the real world.</description>

      <title>Observing weakly broken conservation laws in a dipolar Rydberg quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrable quantum many-body systems host families of extensive conservation laws, some of which are fragile: even infinitesimal perturbations can qualitatively alter their dynamical constraints. Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking.</description>

      <title>Dynamical witnesses and universal behavior across chaos and non-ergodicity in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chaos in isolated quantum systems is intimately linked to thermalization and the rapid relaxation of observables. Although the spectral properties of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model have been well characterized, the corresponding dynamical signatures across the transition to regularity remain less explored . In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Floquet quantum geometry in periodically driven topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry plays a fundamental role across many branches of modern physics, yet its full characterization in nonequilibrium systems remains a challenge. Here, we propose a framework for quantum geometry in Floquet topological insulators by introducing a time-resolved quantum metric tensor, defined via the trace distance between micromotion operators in momentum-time space. For class A in two spatial dimensions, we find a general inequality linking the Floquet quantum metric tensor and the Floquet topology: the associated quantum volume is bounded below by the Floquet topological invariant. This relation is found to also hold in class AIII in one dimension, where the Floquet geometric tensor may be notably reduced due to time-reflection symmetry. This work will be useful in digesting the general aspects of quantum geometry in periodically driven systems in connection with their topological characterization.</description>

      <title>Novel dynamical excitations and roton-based measurement of Cooper-pair momentum in a two-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid on optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of Cooper pairs in unconventional superconductors or superfluids is a topic of great interest in condensed matter physics and ultracold atomic gases. Theoretically, we investigate the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional spin-polarized attractive Hubbard model on a square optical lattice under an effective Zeeman field by computing the density and spin dynamical structure factors, focusing on phase transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to an Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid. In the FFLO superfluid, besides the phonon mode in the density channel, a low-energy bogolon mode emerges in the spin channel, which is associated with Bogoliubov quasiparticles on a Bogoliubov Fermi surface. Moreover, the dynamical excitations exhibit pronounced anisotropy in momentum space due to the finite COM momentum. At half filling, the roton mode around $[\pi,\pi]$ evolves from a point-like minimum into a ring structure shifted by the COM momentum across the BCS-FFLO transition, providing a roton-based protocol to extract the COM momentum. These predictions provide key insights for confirming the existence of FFLO superfluids and understanding their dynamical excitation spectra.</description>

      <title>Steady-state skin effect in bosonic topological edge states under parametric driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted significant theoretical interest due to their extreme properties. However, realizations have mostly been limited to classical applications or artificial setups. In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of finite-temperature quantum adiabaticity in driven many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing quantitative adiabaticity criteria at finite temperature remains substantially less developed than in the pure-state setting, despite the fact that realistic quantum systems are never at absolute zero. Here we derive rigorous bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt fidelity between mixed states by combining a mixed-state quantum speed limit with mixed-state fidelity susceptibility within the Liouville space formulation of quantum mechanics. Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate. Our results provide practical and largely model-independent criteria for finite-temperature adiabaticity in closed many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Putting machine learning to the test in a quantum many-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems pose a formidable computational challenge due to the exponential growth of their Hilbert space. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods.</description>

      <title>Dimer-projection contact and the clock shift of a unitary Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of short-range correlations is a central challenge in strongly interacting Fermi gases. In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic collective excitations of Bose gases in modified Newtonian dynamics</title>

Abstract: Collective excitations are fundamental in quantum many-body physics, yet their spectra have traditionally been studied within Newtonian dynamics. In this paper, we investigate collective excitations in Bose gases under Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive an anisotropic excitation spectrum in the MOND regime. This anisotropy arises directly from the intrinsic nonlinear structure of the MOND Poisson equation, forming a distinctive signature of the modified gravitational response. We then analyze the Jeans instability, obtaining analytic expressions for the direction-dependent critical wavelength and mass. These results advance our understanding of collective behavior in quantum systems under modified dynamics and establish clear theoretical signatures for testing MOND-like effects in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected Bell-cat states in a simple spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schr\"{o}dinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. The Bell-cat states are visualized by plotting their Wigner function and we explore their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix. We also explain the essential topological difference between identical spins and the excitations of a bosonic mode.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced fragmentation and dissipative time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are a peculiar state of matter. Their emergence hinges on ergodicity breaking, which typically originates from many-body localization or Floquet prethermalization. Here we propose a novel scheme for devising robust dissipative time crystals where the ergodicity is broken through symmetry-induced fragmentation. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we first propose a generic Liouvillian with long-time oscillations typical of time crystals. We then show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. Intriguingly, the stage-wise prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model -- as the excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group, the branching rules of the permutation group ensure the robustness of the prethermal time crystal. Our work paves the way for devising time crystals through Hilbert-space fragmentation. It also sheds light on the dynamic effects of non-Hermitian physics in many-body quantum open systems.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</description>

      <title>Atomic-superfluid heat engines controlled by twisted light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity where the optical field carries orbital angular momentum. We first show that the cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic modes whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and phononlike by detuning sweeps, allowing work extraction governed by distinct reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time operation. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as a control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Bose polarons as relativistic Unruh-DeWitt detectors: Entanglement harvesting from Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a bound impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate can be directly mapped to an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a relativistic quantum field. We provide explicit experimental parameters for an implementation using ${}^{39}\text{K}$ impurities coupled to a ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ condensate via finite-time Feshbach tuning. As an application, we study the extraction of vacuum entanglement from distant regions of the condensate and find viable parameters for the implementation of entanglement harvesting.</description>

      <title>Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting uniquely defined Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>
