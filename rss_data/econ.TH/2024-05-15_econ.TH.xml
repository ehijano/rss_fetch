      <title>The Perils of Overreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to study updating rules, we consider the problem of a malevolent principal screening an imperfectly Bayesian agent. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy between underreaction and overreaction to information. If an agent's posterior is farther away from the prior than it should be under Bayes' law, she can always be exploited by the principal to an unfettered degree: the agent's ex ante expected loss can be made arbitrarily large. In stark contrast, an agent who underreacts (whose posterior is closer to the prior than the Bayesian posterior) cannot be exploited at all.</description>

      <title>Revealed preference and revealed preference cycles: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Afriat's Theorem (1967) states that a dataset can be thought of as being generated by a consumer maximizing a continuous and increasing utility function if and only if it is free of revealed preference cycles containing a strict relation. The latter property is often known by its acronym, GARP (for generalized axiom of revealed preference). This paper surveys extensions and applications of Afriat's seminal result. We focus on those results where the consistency of a dataset with the maximization of a utility function satisfying some property can be characterized by a suitably modified version of GARP.</description>

      <title>Goodness-of-fit and utility estimation: what's possible and what's not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A goodness-of-fit index measures the consistency of consumption data with a given model of utility-maximization. We show that for the class of well-behaved (i.e., continuous and increasing) utility functions there is no goodness-of-fit index that is continuous and accurate, where the latter means that a perfect score is obtained if and only if a dataset can be rationalized by a well-behaved utility function. While many standard goodness-of-fit indices are inaccurate we show that these indices are (in a sense we make precise) essentially accurate. Goodness-of-fit indices are typically generated by loss functions and we find that standard loss functions usually do not yield a best-fitting utility function when they are minimized. Nonetheless, welfare comparisons can be made by working out a robust preference relation from the data.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes and non-Bayesian Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show how variational Bayes can be used as a microfoundation for a popular model of non-Bayesian updating. All the results here are mathematically trivial, but I think this direction is potentially interesting.</description>

      <title>Incentive Compatibility in the Auto-bidding World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auto-bidding has recently become a popular feature in ad auctions. This feature enables advertisers to simply provide high-level constraints and goals to an automated agent, which optimizes their auction bids on their behalf. In this paper, we examine the effect of different auctions on the incentives of advertisers to report their constraints to the auto-bidder intermediaries. More precisely, we study whether canonical auctions such as first price auction (FPA) and second price auction (SPA) are auto-bidding incentive compatible (AIC): whether an advertiser can gain by misreporting their constraints to the autobidder.
  We consider value-maximizing advertisers in two important settings: when they have a budget constraint and when they have a target cost-per-acquisition constraint. The main result of our work is that for both settings, FPA and SPA are not AIC. This contrasts with FPA being AIC when auto-bidders are constrained to bid using a (sub-optimal) uniform bidding policy. We further extend our main result and show that any (possibly randomized) auction that is truthful (in the classic profit-maximizing sense), scalar invariant and symmetric is not AIC. Finally, to complement our findings, we provide sufficient market conditions for FPA and SPA to become AIC for two advertisers. These conditions require advertisers' valuations to be well-aligned. This suggests that when the competition is intense for all queries, advertisers have less incentive to misreport their constraints.
  From a methodological standpoint, we develop a novel continuous model of queries. This model provides tractability to study equilibrium with auto-bidders, which contrasts with the standard discrete query model, which is known to be hard. Through the analysis of this model, we uncover a surprising result: in auto-bidding with two advertisers, FPA and SPA are auction equivalent.</description>
