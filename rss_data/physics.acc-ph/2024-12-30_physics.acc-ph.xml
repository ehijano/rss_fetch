      <title>Fundamental Limits on Fiber-Based Electron Acceleration $-$ and How to Overcome Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accelerate ultra-relativistic charged particles, such as electrons, using an electromagnetic pulse along a hollow-core waveguide, the pulse needs to have a longitudinal electric field component and a phase velocity of $c$, the speed of light in vacuum. We derive an approximate closed-form expression for the wavelength at which the phase velocity of the TM$_{01}$ mode in a metal-clad hollow-core fiber with a dielectric layer is $c$. The expression is then used to derive conditions for material dispersion required of the dielectric in order to simultaneously have $c$ phase and group velocity. It is shown that the dispersion would need to be so heavily anomalous that the losses in the anomalously dispersive regime would render such a particle accelerator useless. We then propose the utilization of gain in the form of two spectral peaks in the dielectric to circumvent the otherwise fundamental limits and allow for TM$_{01}$ pulses with $c$ phase and group velocity and thus arbitrary length-scaling of fiber-based electron accelerators. In theory, the group velocity dispersion could also be made zero with further gain-assisted dispersion engineering, allowing for the co-propagation of dispersionless electromagnetic pulses with relativistic particles.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Schottky Diagnostics for Low-SNR Betatron Tune Measurement in Ramping Synchrotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Schottky diagnostics-based method for real-time betatron tune measurement in ramping synchrotrons, exemplified by the Shanghai Advanced Proton Therapy (SAPT) facility. The proposed approach achieves high precision under challenging conditions, including low frequency resolution and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as -15 dB within the bandwidth of a narrowband detector. By employing Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) analysis with automatically optimized time windows, the method effectively addresses the rapid increase in revolution frequency from 4 MHz to 7.5 MHz over 0.35 seconds, assuming constant beam properties within each window. Monte Carlo macro-particle simulations are employed to generate Schottky signals, which are subsequently combined with real noise collected from an analog-to-digital converter to emulate practical conditions. The betatron tune measurement procedure integrates longitudinal signal exclusion, spectrum smoothing, and spectral multiplication to reliably extract transverse Schottky spectra buried in noise, to enable precise betatron tune determination. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing approaches in precision, accuracy, and robustness, while meeting stringent design requirements. This innovative approach addresses key limitations of Schottky diagnostics for betatron tune measurement in ramping synchrotrons, providing a foundation for applications such as proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Theoretical models for longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities driven by harmonic cavities in electron storage rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for analyzing longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities in double-rf systems with even filling patterns, accounting for potential-well distortion and multiple azimuthal modes. The linearized Vlasov equation is solved in the frequency-domain for an arbitrary rf potential to derive the Lebedev equation. We unified different formulations, obtaining results from recent publications as particular cases. Applications to Robinson dipole-quadrupole mode coupling and the periodic transient beam loading (PTBL)/mode-1 instability are presented. Notably, for the first time, theoretical predictions of the mode-1 thresholds show excellent agreement with experimental data. The analysis reveals that the PTBL instability is a zero-frequency effect dependent on azimuthal mode interactions and resistant to Landau damping, providing new insights into its mechanism. The methods are implemented in the open-source package pycolleff, offering a useful semi-analytical tool for studying instabilities in electron storage rings with harmonic cavities.</description>

      <title>Compton photons at the GeV scale from self-aligned collisions with a plasma mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With today's multi-petawatt lasers, testing quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the strong field regime, where the electric field exceeds the Schwinger critical field in the rest frame of an electron, becomes within reach. Inverse Compton scattering of an intense laser pulse off a high-energy electron beam is the mainstream approach, resulting in the emission of high-energy photons that can decay into Breit-Wheeler electron-positron pairs. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that very high energy photons can be generated in a self-aligned single-laser Compton scattering setup, combining a laser-plasma accelerator and a plasma mirror. Reaching up to the GeV scale, photon emission via nonlinear Compton scattering exhibits a nonclassical scaling in the experiment that is consistent with electric fields reaching up to a fraction $\chi\simeq0.3$ of the Schwinger field in the electron rest frame. These foolproof collisions guaranteed by automatic laser-electron overlap provide a new approach for precise investigations of strong-field QED processes.</description>

      <title>JuTrack: a Julia package for auto-differentiable accelerator modeling and particle tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient accelerator modeling and particle tracking are key for the design and configuration of modern particle accelerators. In this work, we present JuTrack, a nested accelerator modeling package developed in the Julia programming language and enhanced with compiler-level automatic differentiation (AD). With the aid of AD, JuTrack enables rapid derivative calculations in accelerator modeling, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimization tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AD-derived derivatives through several practical applications, including sensitivity analysis of space-charge-induced emittance growth, nonlinear beam dynamics analysis for a synchrotron light source, and lattice parameter tuning of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Through the incorporation of automatic differentiation, this package opens up new possibilities for accelerator physicists in beam physics studies and accelerator design optimization.</description>
