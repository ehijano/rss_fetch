      <title>Ground-state properties and structure evolutions of odd-$A$ transuranium Bk isotopes by deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The studies of transuranium nuclei are of vital significance in exploring the existence of the ``island of superheavy nuclei". This work presents the systematic investigations for the ground-state properties and structure evolutions of odd-$A$ transuranium Bk isotopes taking the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with PC-PK1 density functional, in comparison with those by spherical relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory. The DRHBc calculations offer improved descriptions of the binding energies, closely aligning with the experimental data. The incorporation of deformation effects in DRHBc results in enhanced nuclear binding energies and a notable reduction in $\alpha$-decay energies. With the rotational corrections further incorporated, the theoretical deviation by DRHBc from the experimental data is further reduced. Based on the two-neutron gap $\delta_{\rm 2n}$ and the neutron pairing energy $E_{\rm pair}^n$, prominent shell closures at $N=184$ and $258$, as well as potential sub-shell structures at $N=142, 150, 162, 178, 218$, and $230$ are exhibited. A quasi-periodic variation among prolate, oblate, and spherical shapes as well as prolate deformation predominance have been shown in the evolutions of the quadrupole deformation. Possible shape coexistence is predicted in $^{331}$Bk with the oblate and prolate minima in close energies, which is further supported by the triaxial relativistic-mean-field~(RMF)+BCS calculations.</description>

      <title>Exact-exchange relativistic density functional theory in three-dimensional coordinate space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact-exchange relativistic density functional theory (Ex-RDFT) of atomic nuclei has been solved in three-dimensional lattice space for the first time. The exchange energy is treated within the framework of the orbital-dependent relativistic Kohn-Sham density functional theory, wherein the local Lorentz scalar and vector potentials are derived using the relativistic optimized effective potential method. The solutions of binding energies, charge radii, and density distributions are benchmarked against the traditional relativistic Hartree-Fock approach for spherical and axially deformed nuclei. Furthermore, the triaxial neutron-rich $^{104-120}\text{Ru}$ isotopes are investigated with the exchange correlations, which is beyond the current capacity of the traditional relativistic Hartree-Fock approach. The results notably indicate the $\gamma$-softness of these neutron-rich nuclei, which is consistent with experimental observations. This novel approach establishes a foundation for the study of nuclei without imposing any symmetry restrictions employing relativistic density functional with exchange correlations.</description>

      <title>Pairing in Fission: Studies of Static Approach and Collective Inertias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairing plays a crucial role in the microscopic description of nuclear fission. Microscopic methods provide access to three quantities related to pairing, namely, the pairing gap ($\Delta$), the particle number fluctuations ($ \Delta \hat{N}^2 $), and the quenching factor (QF). The aim of this work is to analyse the impact of each of these quantities on the static description of the fission process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We work out the spatial density distributions corresponding to the axial-vector charge density operator for spin-1/2 systems using states described by sharply localized wave packets in arbitrary Lorentz-frames. The static approximation, leading to the frequently assumed Breit-frame distributions, is also considered. We discuss the interpretation of the resulting spatial densities in terms of the axial charge density.</description>

      <title>Channels of Stellar-mass Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. The statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.</description>

      <title>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, illustrating their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Melting of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ pairs in the pre-equilibrium stage of proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the melting of $c\bar c$ and $b\bar b$ pairs in the early stage of high-energy proton-nucleus collisions. We describe the early stage in terms of an evolving $SU(3)$ glasma stage, that is dominated by intense, out-of-equilibrium gluon fields. On top of these fields, we liberate heavy quark-antiquark pairs, whose constituents are let evolve according to relativistic kinetic theory coupled to the gluon fields. We define a pair-by-pair probability that the pair melts during the evolution, which we relate to the relative distance between the two particles in the pair, as well as to the fluctuations of the color charges induced by the interaction of the quarks with the gluon fields. We find that the fluctuations of the color charges favor the melting of the pairs. Moreover, we estimate that within $0.2$ fm/c of proper time, measured with respect to the formation time of the pairs, about the $50\%$ of $c\bar c$ and $b\bar b$ pairs melt as a result of the diffusion of the heavy quarks in the gluon fields; this time estimate doubles when color fluctuations are neglected.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work argued that the scaling of a dimensionless quantity $Q_D$ with path length is a better proxy for quantifying the scaling of the computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity than the timescale. It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be faster than linear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed.</description>

      <title>An Improved Precision Calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ Contact Term within Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is an as-yet unobserved nuclear process, which stands to provide crucial insights for model-building beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Its detection would simultaneously confirm the hypothesis that neutrinos are Majorana fermions, thus violating lepton-number conservation, and provide the first measurement of the absolute neutrino mass scale. This work aims to improve the estimation within chiral effective field theory of the so-called ``contact term'' for $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay, a short-range two-nucleon effect which is unaccounted for in traditional nuclear approaches to the process. We conduct a thorough review of the justifications for this contact term and the most precise computation of its size to date $g_\nu^{NN}$ = 1.3(6) at renormalisation point $\mu=m_\pi$), whose precision is limited by a truncation to elastic intermediate hadronic states. We then perform an extension of this analysis to a subleading class of inelastic intermediate states which we characterise, delivering an updated figure for the contact coefficient ($g_\nu^{NN}$ = 1.4(3) at $\mu=m_\pi$) with uncertainty reduced by half. Such ab initio nuclear results, especially with enhanced precision, show promise for the resolution of disagreements between estimates of $0\nu\nu\beta\beta$ from different many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Angular anisotropy in prefission neutron spectra and PFNS of $^{240}$Pu$(n,F)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular anisotropy of secondary neutrons was evidenced in neutron emission spectra (NES) of $^{239}$Pu+n in 1972, and prompt fission neutron spectra (PFNS) of $^{239}$Pu$(n,F)$ in 2019, it might be predicted for $^{240}$Pu(n,F) PFNS now. In case of NES angular anisotropy is due to direct excitation of collective levels and pre-equilibrium/semi-direct (states in the continuum are excited) mechanism of neutron emission of first neutron in (n,nX) reaction, while in case of PFNS it is due to exclusive spectra of pre-fission neutrons of (n, xnf) reactions. In $^{239}$Pu$(n,xnf)$ and $^{240}$Pu(n,xnf) reactions observed PFNS envision different response to the emission of first pre-fission neutron in forward or backward semi-spheres with respect to the momentum of incident neutrons. Since energies of (n,nf) neutrons and their average values depend on angle of emission theta with respect to the incident neutron momentum, the observed PFNS, average prompt fission neutron multiplicity, fission cross section, average total kinetic energy TKE, etc. also would be quite dependent on angle theta. Exclusive spectra of (n, xnf) neutrons at theta of 90 degrees are consistent with $^{240}$Pu(n, F)($^{239}$Pu$(n,F)$, $^{239}$Pu$(n,2n)$) observed cross sections and neutron emission spectra of $^{239}$Pu+n interaction at En up to 20 MeV. The correlations of the angular anisotropy of PFNS with the relative contribution of the $(n,nf)$ fission chance to the observed fission cross section and angular anisotropy of pre-fission neutron emission are ascertained.</description>

      <title>Pion-nucleon scattering with decuplet contribution in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the complete $T$ matrices with decuplet contributions for pion-nucleon scattering to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$ in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. The baryon mass in the chiral limit $M_0$ and the low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of $\pi N$, the experimental octet-baryon masses, and the value of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ simultaneously. By using these constants, we obtain the $KN$ $\sigma$ terms, $\sigma_{KN}^{(1)}=(375.07\pm33.02)$ MeV and $\sigma_{KN}^{(2)}=(275.32\pm32.24)$ MeV, with the errors being only statistical. An excellent description of the phase shifts is obtained for all partial waves. We also present results for scattering lengths and scattering volumes. In addition, the convergence of the approach is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the effective potentials of the octet baryon and heavy meson systems using the chiral effective field theory up to the next-to-leading order. We consider the contact terms, one-pseudoscalar-meson and two-pseudoscalar-meson exchange contributions, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the short-, mid-, and long-range interactions in these systems. The low energy constants are correlated with those of the $\bar{N}N$ interaction using a quark-level Lagrangian approach. We also incorporate the decuplet baryon contributions in the loop diagrams. Our research provides new insights into several near-threshold charmed baryons [e.g., $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$, $\Xi_{c}(3055)$, and $\Omega_{c}(3188)$, etc.] around $3$ GeV from the hadronic molecular perspective. We also observe several molecular states, referred to as $\Xi_{c}$, within the mass range of $3100-3500$ MeV. Further measurements of their resonance parameters and decay patterns in experiments may help to discriminate the conventional baryon and hadronic molecule explanations for these near-threshold states.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Effects in Energy Correlators: From Characterizing Confinement Transition to Improving $\alpha_s$ Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators provide a powerful observable to study fragmentation dynamics in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading nonperturbative corrections for projected $N$-point energy correlators are described by the same universal parameter for any $N$, which has already been determined from other event shape fits. Including renormalon-free nonperturbative corrections substantially improves theoretical predictions of energy correlators, notably the transition into the confining region at small angles. Nonperturbative corrections are shown to have a significant impact on $\alpha_s$ extractions.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-charmonium interactions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a realistic lattice QCD study on low-energy $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions based on (2+1) flavor configurations with nearly physical pion mass $m_\pi=146$ MeV. The interactions, extracted from the spacetime correlations of nucleon and charmonium system by using the HAL QCD method, are found to be attractive in all distances and possess a characteristic long-range tail consistent with the two-pion exchange potential. The resulting $S$-wave scattering lengths are $0.30(2)\left(^{+0}_{-2}\right)$ fm, $0.38(4)\left(^{+0}_{-3}\right)$ fm, and $0.21(2)\left(^{+0}_{-1}\right)$ fm for spin-$3/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, and spin-$1/2$ $N$-$\eta_c$, respectively. Our results are orders of magnitude larger than those from the photoproduction experiments assuming the vector meson dominance. Our findings may provide deeper understanding of the nonperturbative QCD phenomena ranging from the origin of nucleon mass to the in-medium $J/\psi$ mass modification as well as the properties of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the influence of excitation energy and compound nucleus angular momentum on fission fragment angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the large angular momenta observed for fission fragments is still a question under discussion. To address this, we study isomeric yield ratios (IYR), i.e. the relative population of two or more long-lived metastable states with different spins, of fission products.
  We report on IYR of 17 isotopes produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the IGISOL facility of the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a. The fissioning nuclei in this reaction are $^{233,234,235}$U*. We compare our data to IYR from thermal neutron-induced fission of $^{233}$U and $^{235}$U, and we observe statistically significant larger IYR in the $^{232}$Th($\alpha$,f) reaction, where the average compound nucleus (CN) spin is 7.5 $\hbar$, than in $^{233,235}$U(n$_{th}$,f), with average spins 2.5 and 3.5 $\hbar$, respectively.
  To assess the influence of the excitation energy, we study literature data of IYR from photon-induced fission reactions, and find that the IYR are independent of the CN excitation energy. We conclude that the different IYR must be explained by the different CN spin alone. This implies that the FF angular momentum only partly comes from the fission process itself, and is in addition influenced by the angular momentum present in the CN.</description>
