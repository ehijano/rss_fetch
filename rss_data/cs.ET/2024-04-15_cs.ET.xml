      <title>Reducing the Barriers to Entry for Foundation Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world has recently witnessed an unprecedented acceleration in demands for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications. This spike in demand has imposed tremendous strain on the underlying technology stack in supply chain, GPU-accelerated hardware, software, datacenter power density, and energy consumption. If left on the current technological trajectory, future demands show insurmountable spending trends, further limiting market players, stifling innovation, and widening the technology gap. To address these challenges, we propose a fundamental change in the AI training infrastructure throughout the technology ecosystem. The changes require advancements in supercomputing and novel AI training approaches, from high-end software to low-level hardware, microprocessor, and chip design, while advancing the energy efficiency required by a sustainable infrastructure. This paper presents the analytical framework that quantitatively highlights the challenges and points to the opportunities to reduce the barriers to entry for training large language models.</description>

      <title>Efficient and accurate neural field reconstruction using resistive memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human beings construct perception of space by integrating sparse observations into massively interconnected synapses and neurons, offering a superior parallelism and efficiency. Replicating this capability in AI finds wide applications in medical imaging, AR/VR, and embodied AI, where input data is often sparse and computing resources are limited. However, traditional signal reconstruction methods on digital computers face both software and hardware challenges. On the software front, difficulties arise from storage inefficiencies in conventional explicit signal representation. Hardware obstacles include the von Neumann bottleneck, which limits data transfer between the CPU and memory, and the limitations of CMOS circuits in supporting parallel processing. We propose a systematic approach with software-hardware co-optimizations for signal reconstruction from sparse inputs. Software-wise, we employ neural field to implicitly represent signals via neural networks, which is further compressed using low-rank decomposition and structured pruning. Hardware-wise, we design a resistive memory-based computing-in-memory (CIM) platform, featuring a Gaussian Encoder (GE) and an MLP Processing Engine (PE). The GE harnesses the intrinsic stochasticity of resistive memory for efficient input encoding, while the PE achieves precise weight mapping through a Hardware-Aware Quantization (HAQ) circuit. We demonstrate the system's efficacy on a 40nm 256Kb resistive memory-based in-memory computing macro, achieving huge energy efficiency and parallelism improvements without compromising reconstruction quality in tasks like 3D CT sparse reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes. This work advances the AI-driven signal restoration technology and paves the way for future efficient and robust medical AI and 3D vision applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data center networks are experiencing unprecedented exponential growth, mostly driven by the continuous computing demands in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Within this realm, optical networking offers numerous advantages, including low latency, energy efficiency, and bandwidth transparency, positioning it as a compelling alternative to its electronic counterparts. In this work, we showcase a range of software-defined optical networking applications deployed on a general-purpose programmable integrated photonic processor. Leveraging graph-based theory, we experimentally demonstrate dynamic optical interconnects, circuit switching, and multicasting on the same photonic platform, yielding remarkable results in terms of crosstalk and reconfiguration speed. Our approach harnesses the benefits of reconfigurability and reliability, paving the way for a new generation of high-performance optical devices tailored for data center and computing clusters.</description>

      <title>Routing and Spectrum Allocation in Broadband Quantum Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on max-min fairness in entanglement distribution and compare the performance of various spectrum allocation schemes by examining the max-min and median number of EPR-pairs assigned by them, and the Jain index associated with this assignment. Since this presents an NP-hard problem, we identify two approximation algorithms that outperform others in minimum and mean EPR-pair rate distribution and are comparable to others in the Jain index. We also analyze how the network size and connectivity affect these metrics using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves high minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and runtimes are considered.</description>

      <title>Business models for the simulation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation hypothesis suggests that we live in a computer simulation. That notion has attracted significant scholarly and popular interest. This article explores the simulation hypothesis from a business perspective. Due to the lack of a name for a universe consistent with the simulation hypothesis, we propose the term simuverse. We argue that if we live in a simulation, there must be a business justification. Therefore, we ask: If we live in a simuverse, what is its business model? We identify and explore business model scenarios, such as simuverse as a project, service, or platform. We also explore business model pathways and risk management issues. The article contributes to the simulation hypothesis literature and is the first to provide a business model perspective on the simulation hypothesis. The article discusses theoretical and practical implications and identifies opportunities for future research related to sustainability, digital transformation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$. Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.</description>

      <title>LLeMpower: Understanding Disparities in the Control and Access of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful technology that augment human skill to create new opportunities, akin to the development of steam engines and the internet. However, LLMs come with a high cost. They require significant computing resources and energy to train and serve. Inequity in their control and access has led to concentration of ownership and power to a small collection of corporations. In our study, we collect training and inference requirements for various LLMs. We then analyze the economic strengths of nations and organizations in the context of developing and serving these models. Additionally, we also look at whether individuals around the world can access and use this emerging technology. We compare and contrast these groups to show that these technologies are monopolized by a surprisingly few entities. We conclude with a qualitative study on the ethical implications of our findings and discuss future directions towards equity in LLM access.</description>

      <title>Service Weaver: A Promising Direction for Cloud-native Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud-native and microservice architectures have taken over the development world by storm. While being incredibly scalable and resilient, microservice architectures also come at the cost of increased overhead to build and maintain. Google's Service Weaver aims to simplify the complexities associated with implementing cloud-native systems by introducing the concept of a single modular binary composed of agent-like components, thereby abstracting away the microservice architecture notion of individual services. While Service Weaver presents a promising approach to streamline the development of cloud-native applications and addresses nearly all significant aspects of conventional cloud-native systems, there are existing tradeoffs affecting the overall functionality of the system. Notably, Service Weaver's straightforward implementation and deployment of components alleviate the overhead of constructing a complex microservice architecture. However, it is important to acknowledge that certain features, including separate code bases, routing mechanisms, resiliency, and security, are presently lacking in the framework.</description>

      <title>AAM-VDT: Vehicle Digital Twin for Tele-Operations in Advanced Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study advanced tele-operations in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) through the creation of a Vehicle Digital Twin (VDT) system for eVTOL aircraft, tailored to enhance remote control safety and efficiency, especially for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations. By synergizing digital twin technology with immersive Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces, we notably elevate situational awareness and control precision for remote operators. Our VDT framework integrates immersive tele-operation with a high-fidelity aerodynamic database, essential for authentically simulating flight dynamics and control tactics. At the heart of our methodology lies an eVTOL's high-fidelity digital replica, placed within a simulated reality that accurately reflects physical laws, enabling operators to manage the aircraft via a master-slave dynamic, substantially outperforming traditional 2D interfaces. The architecture of the designed system ensures seamless interaction between the operator, the digital twin, and the actual aircraft, facilitating exact, instantaneous feedback. Experimental assessments, involving propulsion data gathering, simulation database fidelity verification, and tele-operation testing, verify the system's capability in precise control command transmission and maintaining the digital-physical eVTOL synchronization. Our findings underscore the VDT system's potential in augmenting AAM efficiency and safety, paving the way for broader digital twin application in autonomous aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Reliable Argument Quality Annotators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of arguments is a crucial aspect of any system leveraging argument mining. However, it is a challenge to obtain reliable and consistent annotations regarding argument quality, as this usually requires domain-specific expertise of the annotators. Even among experts, the assessment of argument quality is often inconsistent due to the inherent subjectivity of this task. In this paper, we study the potential of using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as proxies for argument quality annotators. To assess the capability of LLMs in this regard, we analyze the agreement between model, human expert, and human novice annotators based on an established taxonomy of argument quality dimensions. Our findings highlight that LLMs can produce consistent annotations, with a moderately high agreement with human experts across most of the quality dimensions. Moreover, we show that using LLMs as additional annotators can significantly improve the agreement between annotators. These results suggest that LLMs can serve as a valuable tool for automated argument quality assessment, thus streamlining and accelerating the evaluation of large argument datasets.</description>

      <title>Building time-surfaces by exploiting the complex volatility of an ECRAM memristor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memristors have emerged as a promising technology for efficient neuromorphic architectures owing to their ability to act as programmable synapses, combining processing and memory into a single device. Although they are most commonly used for static encoding of synaptic weights, recent work has begun to investigate the use of their dynamical properties, such as Short Term Plasticity (STP), to integrate events over time in event-based architectures. However, we are still far from completely understanding the range of possible behaviors and how they might be exploited in neuromorphic computation. This work focuses on a newly developed Li$_\textbf{x}$WO$_\textbf{3}$-based three-terminal memristor that exhibits tunable STP and a conductance response modeled by a double exponential decay. We derive a stochastic model of the device from experimental data and investigate how device stochasticity, STP, and the double exponential decay affect accuracy in a hierarchy of time-surfaces (HOTS) architecture. We found that the device's stochasticity does not affect accuracy, that STP can reduce the effect of salt and pepper noise in signals from event-based sensors, and that the double exponential decay improves accuracy by integrating temporal information over multiple time scales. Our approach can be generalized to study other memristive devices to build a better understanding of how control over temporal dynamics can enable neuromorphic engineers to fine-tune devices and architectures to fit their problems at hand.</description>
