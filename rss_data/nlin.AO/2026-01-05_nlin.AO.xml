      <title>Gardner volumes and self-organization in a minimal model of complex ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study self-organization in a minimally nonlinear model of large random ecosystems. Populations evolve over time according to a piecewise linear system of ordinary differential equations subject to a non-negativity constraint resulting in discrete time extinction and revival events. The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Supersonic Topological Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explain how dissipative active turbulence sustains inertial cascades, we map overdamped chiral flocks to a compressible vortex gas, realizing supersonic topological gas dynamics. Here, Mach cones function as acoustic horizons, shielding defect cores from the radiative decay of shallow water flows. Disorder activates a topological heat pump driving an inverse cascade toward a negative-temperature Onsager dipole, unless arrested into a vortex glass. This identifies a universality class unifying active swarms with classical inviscid fluids.</description>

      <title>Improved estimators of causal emergence for large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in the study of complex systems is the quantification of emergence -- understood as the ability of the system to exhibit collective behaviours that cannot be traced down to the individual components. While recent work has proposed practical measures to detect emergence, these approaches tend to double-count the contribution of shared components, which substantially hinders their capability to effectively study large systems. In this work, we introduce a family of improved information-theoretic measures of emergence that iteratively correct for double-counted terms. Our approach is computationally efficient and provides a controllable trade-off between computational load and sensitivity, leading to more accurate and versatile estimates of emergence. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by successfully detecting emergence in both simulated and real-world data related to flocking behaviour.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Adaptive High-Level Tight Control of Prostate Cancer: A Path from From Terminal Disease to Chronic Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastatic prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is characterized by a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. In this work, we explore how a clinical oncologist can apply a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to prolong metastatic prostate cancer survival, or even make it chronic in duration. We utilize a Bayesian optimization approach to identify the optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) to maximize the time before the patient begins to show symptoms. We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.</description>
