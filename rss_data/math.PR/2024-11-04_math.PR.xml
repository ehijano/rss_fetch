      <title>Transformation of Stochastic Recursions and Critical Phenomena in the Analysis of a Class of Mean Flow Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates, via methods from the theory of probability on trees, critical phenomena in stochastic cascade models of Yule type, and applies these methods to the problem of uniqueness and nonuniqueness of solutions of particular mean flow equations. For linear equations, Feller's classic discovery of the relationship between critical stochastic explosion phenomena for Markov processes and uniqueness and nonuniqueness of solutions to the associated Kolmogorov equation partly illustrates the spirit of the present paper. New methods are introduced to explore the effects that stochastic critical phenomena, such as stochastic explosion, hyperexplosion, t-leaf percolation, have on their corresponding mean flow equations. These methods are illustrated in the context of two non-local differential equations that are related by linearization, the pantograph and the $\alpha$-Riccati equations. In particular, stochastic recursions, stochastic Picard iterations and transformation of solutions processes associated with these equations, are used to establish a `one-to-many principle' for their solutions. The development also includes an application of Feller's classical theory of jump Markov processes to a certain class of pantograph equations that appears to be new.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and Mixing of invariant capacities and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of common conditional expectation to investigate Birkhoff's ergodic theorem and subadditive ergodic theorem for invariant upper probabilities. If in addition, the upper probability is ergodic, we construct an invariant probability to characterize the limit of the ergodic mean. Moreover, this skeleton probability is the unique ergodic probability in the core of the upper probability, that is equal to all probabilities in the core on all invariant sets. We have the following applications of these two theorems:
  $\bullet$ provide a strong law of large numbers for ergodic stationary sequence on upper probability spaces;
  $\bullet$ prove the multiplicative ergodic theorem on upper probability spaces;
  $\bullet$ establish a criterion for the ergodicity of upper probabilities in terms of independence.
  Furthermore, we introduce and study weak mixing for capacity preserving systems. Using the skeleton idea, we also provide several characterizations of weak mixing for invariant upper probabilities.
  Finally, we provide examples of ergodic and weakly mixing capacity preserving systems. As applications, we obtain new results in the classical ergodic theory. e.g. in characterizing dynamical properties on measure preserving systems, such as weak mixing, periodicity. Moreover, we use our results in the nonlinear theory to obtain the asymptotic independence, Birkhoff's type ergodic theorem, subadditive ergodic theorem, and multiplicative ergodic theorem for non-invariant probabilities.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for the nearest neighbour embracing graph in Euclidean and hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a stationary Poisson process $\eta$ in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean or hyperbolic space and construct a random graph with vertex set $\eta$ as follows. First, each point $x\in\eta$ is connected by an edge to its nearest neighbour, then to its second nearest neighbour and so on, until $x$ is contained in the convex hull of the points already connected to $x$. The resulting random graph is the so-called nearest neighbour embracing graph. The main result of this paper is a quantitative description of the Gaussian fluctuations of geometric functionals associated with the nearest neighbour embracing graph. More precisely, the total edge length, more general length-power functionals and the number of vertices with given outdegree are considered.</description>

      <title>RPS: A Generic Reservoir Patterns Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient learning from streaming data is important for modern data analysis due to the continuous and rapid evolution of data streams. Despite significant advancements in stream pattern mining, challenges persist, particularly in managing complex data streams like sequential and weighted itemsets. While reservoir sampling serves as a fundamental method for randomly selecting fixed-size samples from data streams, its application to such complex patterns remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce an approach that harnesses a weighted reservoir to facilitate direct pattern sampling from streaming batch data, thus ensuring scalability and efficiency. We present a generic algorithm capable of addressing temporal biases and handling various pattern types, including sequential, weighted, and unweighted itemsets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its ability to construct accurate incremental online classifiers for sequential data. Our approach not only enables previously unusable online machine learning models for sequential data to achieve accuracy comparable to offline baselines but also represents significant progress in the development of incremental online sequential itemset classifiers.</description>

      <title>Nudging state-space models for Bayesian filtering under misspecified dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nudging is a popular algorithmic strategy in numerical filtering to deal with the problem of inference in high-dimensional dynamical systems. We demonstrate in this paper that general nudging techniques can also tackle another crucial statistical problem in filtering, namely the misspecification of the transition model. Specifically, we rely on the formulation of nudging as a general operation increasing the likelihood and prove analytically that, when applied carefully, nudging techniques implicitly define state-space models (SSMs) that have higher marginal likelihoods for a given (fixed) sequence of observations. This provides a theoretical justification of nudging techniques as data-informed algorithmic modifications of SSMs to obtain robust models under misspecified dynamics. To demonstrate the use of nudging, we provide numerical experiments on linear Gaussian SSMs and a stochastic Lorenz 63 model with misspecified dynamics and show that nudging offers a robust filtering strategy for these cases.</description>

      <title>Adaptive minimax estimation for discretely observed L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonparametric estimation of the density $f_\Delta$ of an increment of a L\'evy process $X$ based on $n$ observations with a sampling rate $\Delta$. The class of L\'evy processes considered is broad, including both processes with a Gaussian component and pure jump processes. A key focus is on processes where $f_\Delta$ is smooth for all $\Delta$. We introduce a spectral estimator of $f_\Delta$ and derive both upper and lower bounds, showing that the estimator is minimax optimal in both low- and high-frequency regimes. Our results differ from existing work by offering weaker, easily verifiable assumptions and providing non-asymptotic results that explicitly depend on $\Delta$. In low-frequency settings, we recover parametric convergence rates, while in high-frequency settings, we identify two regimes based on whether the Gaussian or jump components dominate. The rates of convergence are closely tied to the jump activity, with continuity between the Gaussian case and more general jump processes. Additionally, we propose a fully data-driven estimator with proven simplicity and rapid implementation, supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Small coresets via negative dependence: DPPs, linear statistics, and concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are random configurations of points with tunable negative dependence. Because sampling is tractable, DPPs are natural candidates for subsampling tasks, such as minibatch selection or coreset construction. A \emph{coreset} is a subset of a (large) training set, such that minimizing an empirical loss averaged over the coreset is a controlled replacement for the intractable minimization of the original empirical loss. Typically, the control takes the form of a guarantee that the average loss over the coreset approximates the total loss uniformly across the parameter space. Recent work has provided significant empirical support in favor of using DPPs to build randomized coresets, coupled with interesting theoretical results that are suggestive but leave some key questions unanswered. In particular, the central question of whether the cardinality of a DPP-based coreset is fundamentally smaller than one based on independent sampling remained open. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative, demonstrating that \emph{DPPs can provably outperform independently drawn coresets}. In this vein, we contribute a conceptual understanding of coreset loss as a \emph{linear statistic} of the (random) coreset. We leverage this structural observation to connect the coresets problem to a more general problem of concentration phenomena for linear statistics of DPPs, wherein we obtain \emph{effective concentration inequalities that extend well-beyond the state-of-the-art}, encompassing general non-projection, even non-symmetric kernels. The latter have been recently shown to be of interest in machine learning beyond coresets, but come with a limited theoretical toolbox, to the extension of which our result contributes. Finally, we are also able to address the coresets problem for vector-valued objective functions, a novelty in the coresets literature.</description>

      <title>Pasting of Equilibria and Donsker-type Results for Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the relation between equilibria in single-period, discrete-time and continuous-time mean field game models. First, for single-period mean field games, we establish the existence of equilibria and then prove the propagation of the Lasry-Lions monotonicity to the optimal equilibrium value, as a function of the realization of the initial condition and its distribution. Secondly, we prove a pasting property for equilibria; that is, we construct equilibria to multi-period discrete-time mean field games by recursively pasting the equilibria of suitably initialized single-period games. Then, we show that any sequence of equilibria of discrete-time mean field games with discretized noise converges (up to a subsequence) to some equilibrium of the continuous-time mean field game as the mesh size of the discretization tends to zero. When the cost functions of the game satisfy the Lasry-Lions monotonicity property, we strengthen this convergence result by providing a sharp convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Discrete approximation of risk-based prices under volatility uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of risk-based indifference prices of European contingent claims in discrete-time financial markets under volatility uncertainty as the number of intermediate trading periods tends to infinity. The asymptotic risk-based prices form a strongly continuous convex monotone semigroup which is uniquely determined by its infinitesimal generator and therefore only depends on the covariance of the random factors but not on the particular choice of the model. We further compare the risk-based prices with the worst-case prices given by the $G$-expectation and investigate their asymptotic behaviour as the risk aversion of the agent tends to infinity. The theoretical results are illustrated with several examples and numerical simulations showing, in particular, that the risk-based prices lead to a significant reduction of the bid-ask spread compared to the worst-case prices.</description>

      <title>Fractional kinetics equation from a Markovian system of interacting Bouchaud trap models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a partial exclusion process evolving on $\mathbb Z^d$ in a random trapping environment. In dimension $d\ge 2$, we derive the fractional kinetics equation \begin{equation*}\frac{\partial^\beta\rho_t}{\partial t^\beta} = \Delta \rho_t
  \end{equation*} as a hydrodynamic limit of the particle system. Here, $\frac{\partial^\beta}{\partial t^\beta}$, $\beta\in(0,1)$, denotes the fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. We thus exhibit a Markovian interacting particle system whose empirical density field rescales to a sub-diffusive equation corresponding to a non-Markovian process, the Fractional Kinetics process. In contrast, we show that, when $d=1$, the system rescales to the solution to \begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial \rho_t}{\partial t}= \mathcal L_\beta \rho_t\ , \end{equation*} where $\mathcal L_\beta$ is the random generator of the singular quasi-diffusion known as FIN diffusion.</description>

      <title>Characterising the infinite volume scaling limit of gradient models with non-convex energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scaling limit of statistical mechanics models with non-convex Hamiltonians that are gradient perturbations of Gaussian measures. Characterising features of our gradient models are the imposed boundary tilt and the surface tension (free energy) as a function of tilt. In the regime of low temperatures and bounded tilt, we prove the scaling limit with respect to infinite volume Gibbs states for macroscopic functions on the continuum, and we show that the limit is a continuum Gaussian Free Field with covariance (diffusion) matrix given as the Hessian of surface tension. Our proof of this longstanding conjecture for non-convex energy complements recent studies in [Hil16, ABKM], as well as the proof for strictly convex Hamiltonians in [AW22].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain strong invariance principles for normalized multiple iterated sums and integrals of the form $\bbS_N^{(\nu)}(t)=N^{-\nu/2}\sum_{0\leq k_1&lt;...&lt;k_\nu\leq Nt}\xi(k_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\xi(k_\nu)$, $t\in[0,T]$ and $\bbS_N^{(\nu)}(t)=N^{-\nu/2}\int_{0\leq s_1\leq...\leq s_\nu\leq Nt}\xi(s_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\xi(s_\nu)ds_1\cdots ds_\nu$, where $\{\xi(k)\}_{-\infty&lt;k&lt;\infty}$ and $\{\xi(s)\}_{-\infty&lt;s&lt;\infty}$ are centered stationary vector processes with some weak dependence properties. These imply also laws of iterated logarithm and an almost sure central limit theorem for such objects. In the continuous time we work both under direct weak dependence assumptions and also within the suspension setup which is more appropriate for applications in dynamical systems. Similar results under substantially more restricted conditions were obtained in \cite{FK} relying heavily on rough paths theory and notations while here we obtain these results in a more direct way which makes them accessible to a wider readership. This is a companion paper of our paper "Limit theorems for signatures" and we consider a similar setup and rely on many result from there.</description>

      <title>Onset of pattern formation for the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the solution of a stochastic Allen-Cahn equation $\frac{\partial u_\eps }{\partial t}=\frac 12 \frac{\partial^2 u_\eps }{\partial x^2}+ u_\eps -u_\eps^3+\sqrt\eps\, \dot W$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a suitably large space interval $[-L_\eps , L_\eps]$, starting from the identically zero function, and where $\dot W$ is a space-time white noise. Our main goal is the description, in the small noise limit, of the onset of the phase separation, with the emergence of spatial regions where $u_\eps$ becomes close $1$ or $-1$. The time scale and the spatial structure are determined by a suitable Gaussian process that appears as the solution of the corresponding linearized equation. This issue has been initially examined by De Masi et al. [Ann. Probab. {\bf 22}, (1994), 334-371] in the related context of a class of reaction-diffusion models obtained as a superposition of a speeded up stirring process and a spin flip dynamics on $\{-1,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}_\eps}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_\eps=\mathbb{Z}$ modulo $\lfloor\eps^{-1}L_\eps\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Functional Limit Theorems for Hawkes Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the long-run behavior of Hawkes processes is fully determined by the average number and the dispersion of child events. For subcritical processes we provide FLLNs and FCLTs under minimal conditions on the kernel of the process with the precise form of the limit theorems depending strongly on the dispersion of child events. For a critical Hawkes process with weakly dispersed child events, functional central limit theorems do not hold. Instead, we prove that the rescaled intensity processes and rescaled Hawkes processes behave like CIR-processes without mean-reversion, respectively integrated CIR-processes. We provide the rate of convergence by establishing an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of rescaled Hawkes process and the corresponding limit process. By contrast, critical Hawkes process with heavily dispersed child events share many properties of subcritical ones. In particular, functional limit theorems hold. However, unlike subcritical processes critical ones with heavily dispersed child events display long-range dependencies.</description>

Abstract: Euclidean branching Brownian motion (BBM) has been intensively studied during many decades by renowned researchers. BBM on hyperbolic space has received less attention. A profound study of Lalley and Sellke (1997) provided insight on the recurrent, resp. transient regimes of BBM on the Poincare' disk. In particular, they determined the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set on the boundary circle in dependence on the fission rate of the branching particles. In the present notes, further features are exhibited. The rates of the maximal and minimal hyperbolic distances to the starting point are determined, as well as refined asymptotic estimates in the transient regime. The other main issues studied here concern the behaviour of the empiricial distributions of the branching population, as time goes to infinity, and their convergence to an infinitely supported random limit probability measure on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step walks and $3$-step closed walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  Using a diagram technique, we show that the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in large random graphs. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to the tree-type diagrams obtained, we get explicit expressions for their numbers. This allows us to get upper bounds for ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ as $k\to\infty$ and, in the limit of infinite $q$, to get upper bounds in terms of high moments of Compound Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>Existence and Convergence of Interacting Particle Systems on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a general existence and convergence result for interacting particle systems on locally finite graphs with possibly unbounded degrees or jump rates. We allow the local state space to be Polish, and the jumps at a site to affect the states of its neighbours. The two common assumptions on interacting particle systems are uniform bounds on degrees and jump rates. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and allow for vertices with high degrees or rapid jumps. We introduce new assumptions ensuring that such vertices are placed sufficiently apart from each other and hence the process does not explode. Our assumptions involve finitude of certain weighted connective constants on the $2$-step graph of the underlying graph and our proofs proceed by showing that these assumptions imply non-percolation of the Poisson graphical construction. For some random graph models, if the jump rates are bounded by powers of vertex degrees, we give readily verifiable sufficient conditions on the underlying graph itself, under which our assumptions hold almost surely. These conditions involve exponential growth of the average number of self-avoiding walks from each vertex and that of moments of the vertex degrees. Using these conditions, we show the existence of interacting particle systems with unbounded jump rates like sandpile models on random graphs which can lack uniform bounds on degrees almost surely, e.g., long-range percolations on quasi-transitive graphs, and geometric random graphs on Delone sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Fourier dimension, $\dim_F\mu$, of Mandelbrot multiplicative cascade measures $\mu$ on the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We show that if $\mu$ is the cascade measure generated by a sub-exponential random variable then \[\dim_F\mu=\min\{2,\dim_2\mu\}\,,\] where $\dim_2\mu$ is the correlation dimension of $\mu$ and it has an explicit formula.
  For cascades on the circle $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, we obtain \[\dim_F\mu\ge\frac{\dim_2\mu}{2+\dim_2\mu}\,.\]</description>

      <title>On independence and large deviations for sublinear expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove by counterexample that a large deviation principle established by Chen and Feng [{\em Comm. Statist. Theory Methods} {\bf 45} (2016), 400--412] in the framework of sublinear expectations is incorrect. That implies that the rate function cannot, in general, be obtained by computing the Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function, as is the case for ordinary probabilities. We derive a corrected version of that result and show that the original presentation holds under a stronger independence assumption.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a dynamic model where the state space is the set of contractible cubical sets in the Euclidian space. The permissible state transitions, that is addition and removal of a cube to/from the set, is locally decidable. We prove that in the planar special case the state space is connected. We then define a continuous time Markov chain with a fugacity (tendency to grow) parameter. We prove that, on the plane, the Markov chain is irreducible (due to state connectivity), and is also ergodic if the fugacity is smaller than a threshold.</description>

      <title>On optimal prediction of missing functional data with memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of reconstructing missing parts of functions based on their observed segments. It provides, for Gaussian processes and arbitrary bijective transformations thereof, theoretical expressions for the $L^2$-optimal reconstruction of the missing parts. These functions are obtained as solutions of explicit integral equations. In the discrete case, approximations of the solutions provide consistent expressions of all missing values of the processes. Rates of convergence of these approximations, under extra assumptions on the transformation function, are provided. In the case of Gaussian processes with a parametric covariance structure, the estimation can be conducted separately for each function, and yields nonlinear solutions in presence of memory. Simulated examples show that the proposed reconstruction indeed fares better than the conventional interpolation methods in various situations.</description>

      <title>The stochastic primitive equations with non-isothermal turbulent pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the primitive equations with $\textit{non}$-isothermal turbulent pressure and transport noise. They are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations by employing stochastic versions of the Boussinesq and the hydrostatic approximations. The temperature dependence of the turbulent pressure can be seen as a consequence of an additive noise acting on the small vertical dynamics. For such a model we prove global well-posedness in $H^1$ where the noise is considered in both the It\^{o} and Stratonovich formulations. Compared to previous variants of the primitive equations, the one considered here presents a more intricate coupling between the velocity field and the temperature. The corresponding analysis is seriously more involved than in the deterministic setting. Finally, the continuous dependence on the initial data and the energy estimates proven here are new, even in the case of isothermal turbulent pressure.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the convergence to equilibrium for a (potentially) degenerate nonlinear and nonlocal McKean-Vlasov equation. We show that the solution to this equation is related to the solution of a linear degenerate and/or defective Fokker-Planck equation and employ recent sharp convergence results to obtain an easily computable (and many times sharp) rates of convergence to equilibrium for the equation in question.</description>

      <title>Siegmund duality for physicists: a bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. This is known as Siegmund duality in mathematics. Here we show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of observing a stationary process at irregular time points via a renewal process. We establish a sharp difference in the asymptotic behaviour of the self-normalized sample mean of the observed process depending on the renewal process. In particular, we show that if the renewal process has a moderate heavy tail distribution then the limit is a so-called Normal Variance Mixture (NVM) and we characterize the randomized variance part of the limiting NVM as an integral function of a L\'evy stable motion. Otherwise, the normalized sample mean will be asymptotically normal.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via combinatorial expansion I: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea is to exploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and the noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour integration method with combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery, which has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild assumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different areas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the spiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, and somewhat unexpectedly, we can use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'e inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in \textit{any} normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'e constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'e constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call \emph{long range expansion}, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends \emph{polynomially} on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space with an unconditional basis which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty, characterised by randomness and stochasticity, is ubiquitous in applications of evolutionary game theory across various fields, including biology, economics and social sciences. The uncertainty may arise from various sources such as fluctuating environments, behavioural errors or incomplete information. Incorporating uncertainty into evolutionary models is essential for enhancing their relevance to real-world problems. In this perspective article, we survey the relevant literature on evolutionary dynamics with random payoff matrices, with an emphasis on continuous models. We also pose challenging open problems for future research in this important area.</description>
