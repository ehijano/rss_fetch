      <title>Trajectories of light beams in a Kerr metric: the influence of the rotation of an observer on the shadow of a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the trajectories of light beams in a Kerr metric, which describes the gravitational field in the neighborhood of a rotating black hole. After reduction by cyclic coordinates, this problem reduces to analysis of a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. A bifurcation diagram is constructed and a classification is made of the types of trajectories of the system according to the values of first integrals. Relations describing the boundary of the shadow of the black hole are obtained for a stationary observer who rotates with an arbitrary angular velocity about the axis of rotation of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation can be viewed as the geodesic equation of a certain metric on a 2-surface. In case of the Schr\"odinger equation with a finite-gap potential, the metric and geodesics are explicitly found in terms of the Baker--Akhiezer function</description>

      <title>Integrable Birkhoff Billiards inside Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most interesting problems in the theory of Birkhoff billiards is the problem of integrability. In all known examples of integrable billiards, the billiard tables are either conics, quadrics (closed ellipsoids as well as unclosed quadrics like paraboloids or cones), or specific configurations of conics or quadrics. This leads to the natural question: are there other integrable billiards? The Birkhoff conjecture states that if the billiard inside a convex, smooth, closed curve is integrable, then the curve is an ellipse or a circle.
  In this paper we study the Birkhoff billiard inside a cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We prove that the billiard always admits a first integral of degree two in the components of the velocity vector. Using this fact, we prove that every trajectory inside a $C^3$ convex cone has a finite number of reflections. Here, by $C^3$ convex cone, we mean a cone whose section with some hyperplane is a strictly convex closed $C^3$ submanifold of the hyperplane with nondegenerate second fundamental form. The main result of this paper is the following. We prove that the Birkhoff billiard inside a convex $C^3$ cone is integrable. This is the first example of an integrable billiard where the billiard table is neither a quadric nor composed of pieces of quadrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relations between points in the phase space are central to the study of topological dynamical systems. Since many of these relations share common properties, it is natural to study them within a unified framework. To this end, we introduce the concept of \textit{dynamical pair assignments} $\mathcal{P}$.
  We then introduce the notions of a dynamical system being $\mathcal{P}$-full and $\mathcal{P}$-realizable, which generalize several existing concepts in the field like CPE, weak mixing and UPE. Our results establish that the space of $\mathcal{P}$-full systems is always a Borel set, while the space of $\mathcal{P}$-realizable systems is Borel if and only if an associated natural rank is bounded.</description>

      <title>Stability, periodic orbits and KAM tori in the dynamics of the three fixed centers problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the motion in space of an infinitesimal particle in the gravitational field generated by three primary bodies positioned at the vertices of a fixed equilateral triangle. We assume that the distances between the primaries are small compared to their separation from the particle. By applying a Lie-Deprit normalization, we simplify the Hamiltonian, relegating both the mean anomaly and the argument of periapisis to third-order terms or higher. After reducing out the symmetries associated with the Kepler flow and the central action of the angular momentum, we examine the relative equilibria in the first and second reduced spaces. We are able to identify the conditions for the existence of circular periodic orbits and KAM tori, thus providing insight into the system's long-term stability and dynamic structure.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic stability of a generic Lotka-Volterra system with nonlinear spatially heterogeneous cross-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article considers a class of Lotka-Volterra systems with multiple nonlinear cross-diffusion, commonly known as prey-taxis models. The existence and stability of classic solutions for such systems with spatially homogeneous sources and taxis have been studied in one- or two-dimensional space, however, the proof is non-trivial for a more general setting with spatially heterogeneous predation functions and taxis coefficient functions in arbitrary dimensions. This study introduces a new weighted \(L_\epsilon^p\)-norm and extends some classical inequalities within this normed space. Coupled energy estimates are employed to establish initial bounds, followed by applying heat kernel properties and an advanced bootstrap process to enhance solution regularity. For stability analysis, we extend LaSalle's invariance principle to a general \( L^\infty \) setting and utilize it alongside Lyapunov functions to analyze the stability of each possible constant equilibrium. All results are achieved without introducing an extra logistic growth term for predators or imposing smallness conditions on taxis coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic State Variable in Fundamental Lemma and Its Use in Stability Design for Data-based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the data-based setting, analysis and control design of dynamical systems using measured data are typically based on overlapping trajectory segments of the input and output variables. This could lead to complex designs because the system internal dynamics, which is typically reflected by the system state variable, is unavailable. In this paper, we will show that the coefficient vector in a modified version of Willems' fundamental lemma is an intrinsic and observable state variable for the system behavior. This argument evolves from the behavioral framework without the requirement of prior knowledge on the causality among system variables or any predefined representation structure (e.g., a state space representation). Such a view allows for the construction of a state map based on the fundamental lemma, bridging the trajectory space and the state space. The state property of the coefficient vector allows for a simple stability design approach using memoryless quadratic functions of it as Lyapunov functions, from which the control action for each step can be explicitly constructed. Using the coefficient vector as a state variable could see wide applications in the analysis and control design of dynamical systems including directions beyond the discussions in this paper.</description>

      <title>Euler--Poincar\'e reduction and the Kelvin--Noether theorem for discrete mechanical systems with advected parameters and additional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler--Poincar\'e equations, firstly introduced by Henri Poincar\'e in 1901, arise from the application of Lagrangian mechanics to systems on Lie groups that exhibit symmetries, particularly in the contexts of classical mechanics and fluid dynamics. These equations have been extended to various settings, such as semidirect products, advected parameters, and field theory, and have been widely applied to mechanics and physics. In this paper, we introduce the discrete Euler--Poincar\'e reduction for discrete Lagrangian systems on Lie groups with advected parameters and additional dynamics, utilizing the group difference map technique. Specifically, the group difference map is defined using either the Cayley transform or the matrix exponential. The continuous and discrete Kelvin--Noether theorems are extended accordingly, that account for Kelvin--Noether quantities of the corresponding continuous and discrete Euler--Poincar\'e equations. As an application, we show both continuous and discrete Euler--Poincar\'e formulations about the dynamics of underwater vehicles, followed by numerical simulations. Numerical results illustrate the scheme's ability to preserve geometric properties over extended time intervals, highlighting its potential for practical applications in the control and navigation of underwater vehicles, as well as in other domains.</description>

      <title>Stability of travelling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion equations driven by additive noise with H\"older continuous paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with H\"older continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Wiener processes with general Hurst parameter. In the latter example, we obtain explicit error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts in terms of the Hurst parameter and the spatial regularity for small noise amplitude. Our bounds can be optimised for short times in terms of the Hurst parameter and for large times in terms of the spatial regularity of the noise covariance of the driving fractional Wiener process.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and stability of synchronized solutions in the Kuramoto model with uniformly spaced natural frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical Kuramoto model (KM) with natural frequencies and its continuum limit (CL), and discuss the existence of synchronized solutions and their bifurcations and stability. We specifically assume that the frequency function is symmetric and linear in the CL, so that the natural frequencies are evenly spaced in the KM. We show that in the KM, $O(2^n)$ one-parameter families of synchronized solutions are born and $O(2^n)$ {saddle-node and} pitchfork bifurcations occur at least, when the node number $n$ is odd and tends to infinity. Moreover, we prove that the family of synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work suffers a saddle-node bifurcation at which its stability changes from asymptotically stable to unstable and the other families of synchronized solutions are unstable in the KM. For the CL, we show that the one-parameter family of synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work is the only continuous one and there exist uncountably many one-parameter families of noncontinuous synchronized solutions and that the former is asymptotically stable and the latter are unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a compact surface $M$, consider the natural right action of the group of diffeomorphisms $\mathcal{D}(M)$ of $M$ on $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ defined by the rule: $(f,h)\mapsto f\circ h$ for $f\in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ and $h\in\mathcal{D}(M)$. Denote by $\mathcal{F}(M)$ the subset of $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ consisting of function $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ taking constant values on connected components of $\partial{M}$, having no critical points on $\partial{M}$, and such that at each of its critical points $z$ the function $f$ is $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ equivalent to some homogenenous polynomial without multiple factors. In particular, $\mathcal{F}(M)$ contains all Morse maps. Let also $\mathcal{O}(f) = \{ f\circ h \mid h\in\mathcal{D}(M) \}$ be the orbit of $f$. Previously it was computed the algebraic structure of $\pi_1\mathcal{O}(f)$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}(M)$, where $M$ is any orientable compact surface distinct from $2$-sphere.
  In the present paper we compute the group $\pi_0\mathcal{S}(f,\partial\mathbb{M})$, where $\mathbb{M}$ is a M\"obius band, and $\mathcal{S}(f,\partial\mathbb{M}) = \{ h\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{M}) \mid f\circ h = f, \ h|_{\partial \mathbb{M}} = \mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{M}}\}$ is the subgroup of the corresponding stabilizer of $f$ consisting of diffeomorphisms fixed on the boundary $\partial \mathbb{M}$. As a consequence we obtain an explicit algebraic description of $\pi_1\mathcal{O}(f)$ for all non-orientable surfaces distinct from Klein bottle and projective plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a quadratic-time algorithm to compute the stretch factor and the invariant measured foliations for a pseudo-Anosov element of the mapping class group. As input, the algorithm accepts a word (in any given finite generating set for the mapping class group) representing a pseudo-Anosov mapping class, and the length of the word is our measure of complexity for the input. The output is a train track and an integer matrix where the stretch factor is the largest real eigenvalue and the unstable foliation is given by the corresponding eigenvector. This is the first algorithm to compute stretch factors and measured foliations that is known to terminate in sub-exponential time.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogenisation theory has seen recent application in the derivation of stochastic transport models for fluids dynamics. In this work, we first construct the Lagrange-to-Euler map of an ideal fluid flow, modelled by a stochastic flow of diffeomorphism, as the deterministic homogenized limit of a parameterized flow map that decomposes into rapidly fluctuating and slow components. Specifically, we prove the convergence of this parameterized map to a scale-separated limit under the assumptions of a weak-invariance principle for the rapidly fluctuating component and path continuity for the slow component. In this limit, the rapidly fluctuating component becomes a stochastic flow of diffeomorphism that can introduce stochastic transport into the dynamics of the slow component, which remains to be closed.
  The second contribution of this work formulates two distinct types of variational closures for the slow component of the homogenized flow whilst utilising the composite structure of the full stochastic flow. In one case, the critical points of the new principle satisfy a system of random partial differential equations equivalent to a system of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) under stochastic transport via a transformation by the stochastic flow. Additionally, we show these equations are stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e equations previously derived in Holm, Proc. Royal Soc. (2015). In the other case, we modify the assumptions on the slow component of composite flow and the associated variational principle to derive averaged models inspired by previous work such as Generalised Lagrangian Mean (GLM) and Lagrangian Average Euler Poincar\'e (LAEP).</description>

      <title>ADAM-SINDy: An Efficient Optimization Framework for Parameterized Nonlinear Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying dynamical systems characterized by nonlinear parameters presents significant challenges in deriving mathematical models that enhance understanding of physics. Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing equations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the SINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of established approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This facilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise parameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear characteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or polynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an integrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown variables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification procedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions. The performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum of dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction kinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations (wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of concurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by nonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to extend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex challenges in dynamical system identification.</description>
