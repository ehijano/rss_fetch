      <title>Beyond Endoscopy via Poisson Summation for GL(2,K)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early 2000's, R. Langlands proposed a strategy called Beyond Endoscopy to attack the principle of functoriality, which is one of the central questions of present day mathematics. A first step was achieved by A. Altug who worked with the group $GL(2,\mathbb{Q})$ in a series of three papers. We generalize the first part of this result to a class of totally real number fields. In particular, we cancel the contribution of the trivial and special representations to the trace formula using an additive Poisson summation on the regular elliptic terms.</description>

      <title>Exponential sums with over integers without large prime divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a new bound on exponential sums over integers without large prime divisors, improving that of Fouvry and Tenenbaum (1991). The improvement is based on exploiting the trilinear structure of certain exponential sums, appearing in the argument. We combine this idea with some input from additive combinatorics and, for a fixed integer $\nu\ne 0$, we also obtain new bounds on exponential sums with $\nu$-th powers of such integers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the moduli problem of deformations of nilpotent displays by quasi-isogenies is representable, without using $p$-divisible groups. The main ingredients are Artin's criterion and the theory of truncated displays. This gives in particular a new proof for the representability of Rapoport-Zink spaces.</description>

      <title>Strong-weak symmetry and quantum modularity of resurgent topological strings on local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantizing the mirror curve to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold gives rise to quantum operators whose fermionic spectral traces produce factorially divergent formal power series in the Planck constant and its inverse. These are conjecturally captured by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili and standard topological string free energies, respectively, via the TS/ST correspondence. The resurgent structures of the first fermionic spectral trace of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ in both weak and strong coupling limits were solved exactly by the second author in [1]. Here, we take the perspective of the Stokes constants and their generating functions. We prove that a full-fledged strong-weak resurgent symmetry is at play, exchanging the perturbative/nonperturbative contributions to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic blocks in the factorization of the spectral trace. This relies on a global net of relations connecting the perturbative series and the discontinuities in the dual regimes, which is built upon the analytic properties of the $L$-functions with coefficients given by the Stokes constants and the $q$-series acting as their generating functions. Then, we show that the latter are holomorphic quantum modular forms for $\Gamma_1(3)$ and are reconstructed by the median resummation of their asymptotic expansions.</description>

      <title>On the moduli description of ramified unitary Local models of signature (n-1,1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a moduli description for the ramified unitary local model of signature (n-1,1) with any parahoric level structure when the residue field has characteristic not equals 2, confirming a conjecture of Smithling. As applications, we can present moduli descriptions for: (1) ramified unitary Pappas-Zhu local models with any parahoric level; (2) the irreducible components of their special fiber with maximal parahoric level; (3) integral model of ramified unitary Shimura varieties for any (quasi-)parahoric level.</description>

      <title>Integer-valued o-minimal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{R}_{\textrm{an},\exp}$-definable functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ that take integer values at all sufficiently large positive integers. If $|f(x)|= O\big(2^{(1+10^{-5})x}\big)$, then we find polynomials $P_1, P_2$ such that $f(x)=P_1(x)+P_2(x)2^x$ for all sufficiently large $x$. Our result parallels classical theorems of P\'olya and Selberg for entire functions and generalizes Wilkie's classification for the case of $|f(x)|= O(C^x)$, for some $C&lt;2$.
  Let $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\gamma_k=\sum_{j=1}^{k} 1/j$. Extending Wilkie's theorem in a separate direction, we show that if $f$ is $k$-$\textit{concordant}$ and $|f(x)|= O(C^{x})$, for some $C&lt;e^{\gamma_k}+1$, then $f$ must eventually be given by a polynomial. This is an analog of a result by Pila for entire functions.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of infinitely generated self-affine sets and restricted digit sets for signed L\"uroth expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For countably infinite IFSs on $\mathbb R^2$ consisting of affine contractions with diagonal linear parts, we give conditions under which the affinity dimension is an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension and a lower bound for the lower box-counting dimension. Moreover, we identify a family of countably infinite IFSs for which the Hausdorff and affinity dimension are equal, and which have full dimension spectrum. The corresponding self-affine sets are related to restricted digit sets for signed L\"uroth expansions.</description>

      <title>Archimedean Newform Theory for $\mathrm{GL}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new invariant, the conductor exponent, of a generic irreducible Casselman-Wallach representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ that quantifies the extent to which this representation may be ramified. We also determine a distinguished vector, the newform, occurring with multiplicity one in this representation, with the complexity of this vector measured in a natural way by the conductor exponent. Finally, we show that the newform is a test vector for $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_n$ and $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_{n - 1}$ Rankin-Selberg integrals when the second representation is unramified. This theory parallels an analogous nonarchimedean theory due to Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika; combined, this completes a global theory of newforms for automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ over number fields. By-products of the proofs include new proofs of Stade's formulae and a new resolution of the test vector problem for archimedean Godement-Jacquet zeta integrals.</description>

      <title>On the Constants of the Lang-Trotter Conjecture for CM Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, Daqing Wan and Ping Xi studied the equivalence of the Lang-Trotter conjecture for CM elliptic curves and the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture for primes represented by a quadratic polynomial. Wan and Xi provided an alternative description of the Lang-Trotter conjecture under the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture. They obtained an explicit constant $\overline{\omega}_{E,r}$ in the asymptotics of the Lang-Trotter conjecture. They further conjectured that this particular constant would be equal to the constant $C_{E,r}$ in the asymptotics of the original Lang-Trotter conjecture. In this paper, we verify the same for $20$ CM elliptic curves, which also establishes the equivalence of the Lang-Trotter Conjecture and the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture with respect to $r$, for these CM elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>A Complete Congruence System for the Erdos-Straus Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we attack the Erdos-Straus conjecture by means of the structure of its solutions, extending and improving the results of a previous paper. Using previous results and supported by the works of Elsholtz and Tao and Monks and Velingker we define a system of congruences for which there are always solutions to the Erdos-Straus conjecture and which we conjecture to include all prime numbers. For this purpose, and always taking into account a result due to Mordell that limits the congruences admitting polynomial identities to those that are not quadratic residues, we will adopt a transversal approach and classify the solutions by their form and not by those congruences that produce them. Thus we define two new types of solutions, which we call Type A and B, and relate them to the already known Type II solutions and study their properties. Finally we conjecture that every prime number has at least one solution of Type A or B and we associate a congruence and a general polynomial to each Type of solution.</description>

      <title>Monogenic Quartic Polynomials and Their Galois Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A monic polynomial $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ of degree $N$ is called monogenic if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\ldots ,\theta^{N-1}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)=0$. In this article, we use the classification of the Galois groups of quartic polynomials, due to Kappe and Warren, to investigate the existence of infinite collections of monogenic quartic polynomials having a prescribed Galois group, such that each member of the collection generates a distinct quartic field. With the exception of the cyclic case, we provide such an infinite single-parameter collection for each possible Galois group. We believe these examples are new, and we provide evidence to support this belief by showing that they are distinct from other infinite collections in the current literature. Finally, we devote a separate section to a discussion concerning, what we believe to be, the still-unresolved cyclic case.</description>

      <title>A bijection for tuples of commuting permutations and a log-concavity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A(\ell,n,k)$ denote the number of $\ell$-tuples of commuting permutations of $n$ elements whose permutation action results in exactly $k$ orbits or connected components. We provide a new proof of an explicit formula for $A(\ell,n,k)$ which is essentially due to Bryan and Fulman, in their work on orbifold higher equivariant Euler characteristics. Our proof is self-contained, elementary, and relies on the construction of an explicit bijection, in order to perform the $\ell+1\rightarrow \ell$ reduction. We also investigate a conjecture by the first author, regarding the log-concavity of $A(\ell,n,k)$ with respect to $k$. The conjecture generalizes a previous one by Heim and Neuhauser related to the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula.</description>

      <title>Digraphs, pro-$p$ groups and Massey products in Galois cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We characterize the oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ groups whose $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology algebra yields no essential $n$-fold Massey products for every $n&gt;2$, in terms of the associated digraph. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology algebra of such oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ groups is isomorphic to the exterior Stanley-Reisner $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra associated to the same digraph. This work also aims at providing a concrete and group-theoretic introduction to the study of Massey products in Galois cohomology for non-specialists, especially graduate students working in profinite group theory.</description>
