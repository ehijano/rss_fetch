      <title>Baton: Compensate for Missing Wi-Fi Features for Practical Device-free Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi contact-free sensing systems have attracted widespread attention due to their ubiquity and convenience. The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology utilizes off-the-shelf Wi-Fi communication signals for sensing, which further promotes the deployment of intelligent sensing applications. However, current Wi-Fi sensing systems often require prolonged and unnecessary communication between transceivers, and brief communication interruptions will lead to significant performance degradation. This paper proposes Baton, the first system capable of accurately tracking targets even under severe Wi-Fi feature deficiencies. To be specific, we explore the relevance of the Wi-Fi feature matrix from both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The horizontal dimension reveals feature correlation across different Wi-Fi links, while the vertical dimension reveals feature correlation among different time slots. Based on the above principle, we propose the Simultaneous Tracking And Predicting (STAP) algorithm, which enables the seamless transfer of Wi-Fi features over time and across different links, akin to passing a baton. We implement the system on commercial devices, and the experimental results show that our system outperforms existing solutions with a median tracking error of 0.46m, even when the communication duty cycle is as low as 20.00%. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our system reduces the tracking error by 79.19% in scenarios with severe Wi-Fi feature deficiencies.</description>

      <title>A Satellite-Ground Synergistic Large Vision-Language Model System for Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) unleash powerful analysis capabilities for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Earth observation images in the data center. However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station (GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g., disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission, separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite constellations and datasets, achieving a 31.2% average gain in accuracy and a 51.2% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Intra-DP: A High Performance Collaborative Inference System for Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations. To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e., operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>OLAF: Programmable Data Plane Acceleration for Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can suffer from degraded convergence when model updates become stale, often the result of network congestion and packet loss during large-scale training. This work introduces a network data-plane acceleration architecture that mitigates such staleness by enabling inline processing of DRL model updates as they traverse the accelerator engine. To this end, we design and prototype a novel queueing mechanism that opportunistically combines compatible updates sharing a network element, reducing redundant traffic and preserving update utility. Complementing this we provide a lightweight transmission control mechanism at the worker nodes that is guided by feedback from the in-network accelerator. To assess model utility at line rate, we introduce the Age-of-Model (AoM) metric as a proxy for staleness and verify global fairness and responsiveness properties using a formal verification method. Our evaluations demonstrate that this architecture significantly reduces update staleness and congestion, ultimately improving the convergence rate in asynchronous DRL workloads.</description>

      <title>Programmable Governance for Group-Controlled Decentralized Identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a paradigm for digital identity management that offers unique privacy advantages. A key technology in SSI is Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and their associated metadata, DID Documents (DDOs). DDOs contain crucial verification material such as the public keys of the entity identified by the DID (i.e., the DID subject) and are often anchored on a distributed ledger to ensure security and availability. Long-lived DIDs need to support updates (e.g., key rotation). Ideally, only the DID subject should authorize DDO updates. However, in practice, update capabilities may be shared or delegated. While the DID specification acknowledges such scenarios, it does not define how updates should be authorized when multiple entities jointly control a DID (i.e., group control). This article examines the implementation of an on-chain, trustless mechanism enabling DID controllers under group control to program their governance rules. The main research question is the following: Can a technical mechanism be developed to orchestrate on-chain group control of a DDO in a ledger-agnostic and adaptable manner?</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Multi-UAV Coverage and Power-Efficient UE Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In critical situations such as natural disasters, network outages, battlefield communication, or large-scale public events, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising approach to maximize wireless coverage for affected users in the shortest possible time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where multiple UAVs are deployed with the objective to maximize the number of served user equipment (UEs) while ensuring a predefined data rate threshold. UEs are initially clustered using a K-means algorithm, and UAVs are optimally positioned based on the UEs' spatial distribution. To optimize power allocation and mitigate inter-cluster interference, we employ the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, considering both LOS and NLOS fading. Simulation results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances UEs coverage and outperforms Deep Q-Network (DQN) and equal power distribution methods, improving their UE coverage by up to 2.07 times and 8.84 times, respectively.</description>

      <title>GCN-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Probabilistic Real-Time Guarantees in Industrial URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand, network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and 175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC requirements with minimal overhead and superior network performance.</description>

      <title>Relative Phase Equivariant Deep Neural Systems for Physical Layer Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of telecommunications, the increasing demand for complex and specialized communication systems has led to a focus on improving physical layer communications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution avenue for doing so. Deep neural receivers have already shown significant promise in improving the performance of communications systems. However, a major challenge lies in developing deep neural receivers that match the energy efficiency and speed of traditional receivers. This work investigates the incorporation of inductive biases in the physical layer using group-equivariant deep learning to improve the parameter efficiency of deep neural receivers. We do so by constructing a deep neural receiver that is equivariant with respect to the phase of arrival. We show that the inclusion of relative phase equivariance significantly reduces the error rate of deep neural receivers at similar model sizes. Thus, we show the potential of group-equivariant deep learning in the domain of physical layer communications.</description>

      <title>MOD-X: A Modular Open Decentralized eXchange Framework proposal for Heterogeneous Interoperable Artificial Intelligence Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols. Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents (agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central coordination.</description>
