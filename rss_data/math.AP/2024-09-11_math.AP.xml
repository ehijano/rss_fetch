      <title>Adhesion and volume filling in one-dimensional population dynamics under no-flux boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the (generalized) one-dimensional population model developed by Anguige \&amp; Schmeiser [1], which reflects cell-cell adhesion and volume filling under no-flux boundary condition. In this generalized model, depending on the adhesion and volume filling parameters $\alpha,\beta\in[0,1],$ the resulting equation is classified into six types. Among these, we focus on the type exhibiting strong effects of both adhesion and volume filling, which results in a class of advection-diffusion equations of the forward-backward-forward type. For five distinct cases of initial maximum, minimum and average population densities, we derive the corresponding patterns for the global behavior of weak solutions to the initial and no-flux boundary value problem. Due to the presence of a negative diffusion regime, we indeed prove that the problem is ill-posed and admits infinitely many global-in-time weak solutions, with the exception of one specific case of the initial datum. This nonuniqueness is inherent in the method of convex integration that we use to solve the Dirichlet problem of a partial differential inclusion arising from the ill-posed problem.</description>

      <title>Stability of the 3-dimensional catenoid for the hyperbolic vanishing mean curvature equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the $3$-dimensional catenoid is asymptotically stable as a solution to the hyperbolic vanishing mean curvature equation in Minkowski space, modulo suitable translation and boost (i.e., modulation) and with respect to a codimension one set of initial data perturbations. The modulation and the codimension one restriction on the initial data are necessary (and optimal) in view of the kernel and the unique simple eigenvalue, respectively, of the stability operator of the catenoid.
  The $3$-dimensional problem is more challenging than the higher (specifically, $5$ and higher) dimensional case addressed in the previous work of the authors with J.~L\"uhrmann, due to slower temporal decay of waves and slower spatial decay of the catenoid. To overcome these issues, we introduce several innovations, such as a proof of Morawetz- (or local-energy-decay-) estimates for the linearized operator with slowly decaying kernel elements based on the Darboux transform, a new method to obtain Price's-law-type bounds for waves on a moving catenoid, as well as a refined profile construction designed to capture a crucial cancellation in the wave-catenoid interaction. In conjunction with our previous work on the higher dimensional case, this paper outlines a systematic approach for studying other soliton stability problems for $(3+1)$-dimensional quasilinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Remarks on comparison principles for p-Laplacian with extension to (p,q)-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our purpose is to generalize some recent comparison principles for operators driven by p-Laplacian to a wide class of quasilinear equations including (p, q)-Laplacian. It turns out, in particular, that adding a q-Laplacian to p-Laplacian allows to weaken the assumptions needed on the Hamiltonian of lower order terms. The results are specialized in the case that the Hamiltonian has at most polynomial growth in the gradient with coefficients depending on x and u.</description>

      <title>Existence of ground states for free energies on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a free energy functional that arises in aggregation-diffusion phenomena modelled by nonlocal interactions and local repulsion on the hyperbolic space $\bbh^\dm$. The free energy consists of two competing terms: an entropy, corresponding to slow nonlinear diffusion, that favours spreading, and an attractive interaction potential energy that favours aggregation. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the interaction potential for ground states to exist on the hyperbolic space $\bbh^\dm$. To prove our results we derived several Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev (HLS)-type inequalities on general Cartan-Hadamard manifolds of bounded curvature, which have an interest in their own.</description>

      <title>SBV regularity of Entropy Solutions for Hyperbolic Systems of Balance Laws with General Flux function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that vanishing viscosity solutions to smooth non-degenerate systems of balance laws having small bounded variation, in one space dimension, must be functions of special bounded variation. For more than one equation, this is new also in the case of systems of conservation laws out of the context of genuine nonlinearity. For general smooth strictly hyperbolic systems of balance laws, this regularity fails, as known for systems of balance laws: we generalize the SBV-like regularity of the eigenvalue functions of the Jacobian matrix of flux from conservation to balance laws. Proofs are based on extending Oleinink-type balance estimates, with the introduction of new source measures, localization arguments, and observations in real analysis. Preliminary version.</description>

      <title>SBV-like regularity of Entropy Solutions for a Scalar Balance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we discuss the SBV-regularity for a scalar balance law in one space dimension as a case study in order to explain the strategy that we apply in a separate paper to general hyperbolic systems of balance laws in one space dimension. While for a single balance law the more general work by Robyr is already available, the case of 1d-systems presents new behaviors that require a different strategy. This is why in this note we make the effort to introduce the notation and tools that are required for the case of more equations. When the flux presents linear degeneracies, it is know that entropy solutions can present nasty fractal Cantor-like behaviors, although f'(u) is still SBV: we thus discuss SBV-like regularity generalizing the work by Bianchini-Yu as SBV-regularity fails.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansion of a nonlocal phase transition energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the fractional Allen--Cahn energy functional in bounded domains with prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions.
  When the fractional power $s \in (0,\frac12)$, we establish the complete asymptotic development up to the boundary in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence. In particular, we prove that the first-order term is the nonlocal minimal surface functional while all higher-order terms are zero.
  For $s \in [\frac12,1)$, we focus on the one-dimensional case and we prove that the first order term is the classical perimeter functional plus a penalization on the boundary. Towards this end, we establish existence of minimizers to a corresponding fractional energy in a half-line, which provides itself a new feature with respect to the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Stability of an Inverse Problem of Transmission Waves with Variable Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies an inverse problem for a transmission wave equation, a system where the main coefficient has a variable jump across an internal interface given by the boundary between two subdomains. The main result obtains Lipschitz stability in recovering a zeroth-order coefficient in the equation. The proof is based on the Bukhgeim-Klibanov method and uses a new one-parameter global Carleman inequality, specifically constructed for the case of a variable main coefficient which is discontinuous across a strictly convex interface. In particular, our hypothesis allows the main coefficient to vary smoothly within each subdomain up to the interface, thereby extending the preceding literature on the subject.</description>

      <title>Regular Strichartz estimates in Lorentz-type spaces with application to the $H^s$-critical inhomogeneous biharmonic NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem for the $H^s$-critical inhomogeneous biharmonic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (IBNLS) equation \[iu_{t}\pm \Delta^{2} u=\lambda |x|^{-b}|u|^{\sigma}u,~u(0)=u_{0} \in H^{s} (\mathbb R^{d}),\] where $\lambda\in \mathbb C$, $d\ge 3$, $1\le s&lt;\frac{d}{2}$, $0&lt;b&lt;\min \left\{4,2+\frac{d}{2}-s \right\}$ and $\sigma=\frac{8-2b}{d-2s}$. First, we study the properties of Lorentz-type spaces such as Besov-Lorentz spaces and Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz spaces. We then derive the regular Strichartz estimates for the corresponding linear equation in Lorentz-type spaces. Using these estimates, we establish the local well-posedness as well as the small data global well-posedness and scattering in $H^s$ for the $H^s$-critical IBNLS equation under less regularity assumption on the nonlinear term than in the recent work \cite{AKR24}. This result also extends the ones of \cite{SP23,SG24} by extending the validity of $d$, $b$ and $s$. Finally, we give the well-posedness result in the homogeneous Sobolev spaces $\dot{H}^s$.</description>

      <title>Frequency range non-Lipschitz parametric optimization of a noise absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the optimal wave energy absorption, we solve theoretically and numerically a parametric shape optimization problem to find the optimal distribution of absorbing material in the reflexive one defined by a characteristic function in the Robin-type boundary condition associated with the Helmholtz equation. Robin boundary condition can be given on a part or the all boundary of a bounded ($\epsilon$, $\infty$)-domain of R n . The geometry of the partially absorbing boundary is fixed, but allowed to be non-Lipschitz, for example, fractal. It is defined as the support of a d-upper regular measure with d $\in$]n -2, n[. Using the well-posedness properties of the model, for any fixed volume fraction of the absorbing material, we establish the existence of at least one optimal distribution minimizing the acoustical energy on a fixed frequency range of the relaxation problem. Thanks to the shape derivative of the energy functional, also existing for non-Lipschitz boundaries, we implement (in the two-dimensional case) the gradient descent method and find the optimal distribution with 50% of the absorbent material on a frequency range with better performances than the 100% absorbent boundary. The same type of performance is also obtained by the genetic method.</description>

      <title>Note on the existence of classical solutions of derivative semilinear models for one dimensional wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is a supplement with a new result to the review paper by Takamura [13] on nonlinear wave equations in one space dimension. We are focusing here to the long-time existence of classical solutions of semilinear wave equations in one space dimension, especially with derivative nonlinear terms of product-type. Our result is an extension of the single component case, but it is meaningful to provide models as possible as many to cover the optimality of the general theory. The proof is based on the classical iteration argument of the point-wise estimate of the solution.</description>

Abstract: We prove that Palais-Smale sequences for Liouville type functionals on closed surfaces are precompact whenever they satisfy a bound on their Morse index. As a byproduct, we obtain a new proof of existence of solutions for Liouville type mean-field equations in a supercritical regime. Moreover, we also discuss an extension of this result to the case of singular Liouville equations.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time well-posedness for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with freely transported viscosity coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global-in-time well-posedness of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with freely transported viscosity coefficient, under a scaling-invariant smallness condition on the initial data. The viscosity coefficient is allowed to exhibit large jumps across $W^{2,2+\epsilon}$-interfaces.
  The viscous stress tensor $\mu Su$ is carefully analyzed. Specifically, $(R^\perp\otimes R):(\mu Su)$, where $R$ denotes the Riesz operator, defines a ``good unknown'' that satisfies time-weighted $H^1$-energy estimates. Combined with tangential regularity, this leads to the $W^{1,2+\epsilon}$-regularity of another ``good unknown'', $(\bar{\tau}\otimes n):(\mu Su)$, where $\bar{\tau}$ and $n$ denote the unit tangential and normal vectors of the interfaces, respectively. These results collectively provide a Lipschitz estimate for the velocity field, even in the presence of significant discontinuities in $\mu$.
  As applications, we investigate the well-posedness of the Boussinesq equations without heat conduction and the density-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the coupled Schr\"odinger-KdV system
  \begin{align*} \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u +\lambda_1 u=u^3+\beta uv~~&amp;\text{in}~~\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\-\Delta v +\lambda_2 v=\frac{1}{2}v^2+\frac{1}{2}\beta u^2~~&amp;\text{in}~~\mathbb{R}^{3} \end{cases} \end{align*} subject to the mass constraints \begin{equation*} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}|u|^2 dx=a,\quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}|v|^2 dx=b, \end{equation*}
  where $a, b&gt;0$ are given constants, $\beta&gt;0$, and the frequencies $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ arise as Lagrange multipliers. The system exhibits $L^2$-supercritical growth. Using a novel constraint minimization approach, we demonstrate the existence of a local minimum solution to the system. Furthermore, we establish the existence of normalized ground state solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the uniqueness of the critical point for stable solutions of the Robin problem \[ \begin{cases} -\Delta u=f(u)&amp;\text{in }\Omega\\ u&gt;0&amp;\text{in }\Omega\\ \partial_\nu u+\beta u=0&amp;\text{on }\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ is a smooth and bounded domain with strictly positive curvature of the boundary, $f\ge0$ is a smooth function and $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, for $\beta$ large the result fails as soon as the domain is no more convex, even if it is very close to be: indeed, in this case it is possible to find solutions with an arbitrary large number of critical points.</description>

The penalized problem is a kind of the Lam\'{e} system, so we first discuss the corner singularity theory of the Lam\'{e} system with inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on a non-convex polygon. Considering the inhomogeneous condition, we show the decomposition of its solution, composed of singular parts and a smoother remainder near a re-entrant corner, and furthermore, we provide the explicit formulae of coefficients in singular parts. In particular, these formulae can be used in the development of highly accurate numerical scheme. In addition, we formulate coefficients in singular parts regarding the Stokes equations with inhomogeneous boundary condition and non-divergence-free property of velocity field, and thus we show the convergence results of coefficients in singular parts and remainder regarding the concerned penalized problem.</description>

      <title>Finite-time horizon, stopper vs. singular-controller games on the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of a value for two-player zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller games on finite-time horizon, when the underlying dynamics is one-dimensional, diffusive and bound to evolve in $[0,\infty)$. We show that the value is the maximal solution of a variational inequality with both obstacle and gradient constraint and satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition at $[0,T)\times\{0\}$. Moreover, we obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper. Compared to the existing literature on this topic, we introduce new probabilistic methods to obtain gradient bounds and equi-continuity for the solutions of penalised partial differential equations (PDE) that approximate the variational inequality.</description>

      <title>Mathematical foundations of phonons in incommensurate materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some models, periodic configurations can be shown to be stable under, both, global $\ell^2$ or local perturbations. This is not the case for aperiodic media. The specific class of aperiodic media we are interested, in arise from taking two 2D periodic crystals and stacking them parallel at a relative twist. In periodic media, phonons are generalized eigenvectors for a stability operator acting on $\ell^2$, coming from a mechanical energy. The goal of our analysis is to provide phonons in the given class of aperiodic media with meaning. As rigorously established for the 1D Frenkel-Kontorova model and previously applied by one of the authors, we assume that we can parametrize minimizing lattice deformations w.r.t. local perturbations via continuous stacking-periodic functions, for which we previously derived a continuous energy density functional. Such (continuous) energy densities are analytically and computationally much better accessible compared to discrete energy functionals. In order to pass to an $\ell^2$-based energy functional, we also study the offset energy w.r.t. given lattice deformations, under $\ell^1$-perturbations. Our findings show that, in the case of an undeformed bilayer heterostructure, while the energy density can be shown to be stable under the assumption of stability of individual layers, the offset energy fails to be stable in the case of twisted bilayer graphene. We then establish conditions for stability and instability of the offset energy w.r.t. the relaxed lattice. Finally, we show that, in the case of incommensurate bilayer homostructures, i.e., two equal layers, if we choose minimizing deformations according to the global energy density above, the offset energy is stable in the limit of zero twist angle. Consequently, in this case, one can then define phonons as generalized eigenvectors w.r.t. the stability operator associated with the offset energy.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable networks of integrate-and-fire neurons: spatially-extended mean-field limit of the empirical measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of exchangeable or spatially-structured networks of $N$ interacting stochastic neurons can be described by deterministic population equations in the mean-field limit $N\to\infty$, when synaptic weights scale as $O(1/N)$. This asymptotic behavior has been proven in several works but a general question has remained unanswered: does the $O(1/N)$ scaling of synaptic weights, by itself, suffice to guarantee the convergence of network dynamics to a deterministic population equation, even when networks are not assumed to be exchangeable or spatially structured? In this work, we consider networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons with arbitrary synaptic weights satisfying only a $O(1/N)$ scaling condition. Borrowing results from the theory of dense graph limits (graphons), we prove that, as $N\to\infty$, and up to the extraction of a subsequence, the empirical measure of the neurons' membrane potentials converges to the solution of a spatially-extended mean-field partial differential equation (PDE). Our proof requires analytical techniques that go beyond standard propagation of chaos methods. In particular, we introduce a weak metric that depends on the dense graph limit kernel and we show how the weak convergence of the initial data can be obtained by propagating the regularity of the limit kernel along the dual-backward equation associated with the spatially-extended mean-field PDE. Overall, this result invites us to re-interpret spatially-extended population equations as universal mean-field limits of networks of neurons with $O(1/N)$ synaptic weight scaling.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of Dirac operators for dislocated potentials with a purely imaginary jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a complete spectral analysis of Dirac operators with non-Hermitian matrix potentials of the form $i\operatorname{sgn}(x)+V(x)$ where $V\in L^1$. For $V=0$ we compute explicitly the matrix Green function. This allows us to determine the spectrum, which is purely essential, and its different types. It also allows us to find sharp enclosures for the pseudospectrum and its complement, in all parts of the complex plane. Notably, this includes the instability region, corresponding to the interior of the band that forms the numerical range. Then, with the help of a Birman-Schwinger principle, we establish in precise manner how the spectrum and pseudospectrum change when $V\not=0$, assuming the hypotheses $\|V\|_{L^1}&lt;1$ or $V\in L^1\cap L^p$ where $p&gt;1$. We show that the essential spectra remain unchanged and that the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum stays close to the instability region for small $\varepsilon$. We determine sharp asymptotic for the discrete spectrum, whenever $V$ satisfies further conditions of decay at infinity. Finally, in one of our main findings, we give a complete description of the weakly-coupled model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a shape optimization based method for finding the best interpolation data in the compression of images with noise. The aim is to reconstruct missing regions by means of minimizing a data fitting term in an $L^p$-norm between original images and their reconstructed counterparts using linear diffusion PDE-based inpainting. Reformulating the problem as a constrained optimization over sets (shapes), we derive the topological asymptotic expansion of the considered shape functionals with respect to the insertion of small ball (a single pixel) using the adjoint method. Based on the achieved distributed topological shape derivatives, we propose a numerical approach to determine the optimal set and present numerical experiments showing, the efficiency of our method. Numerical computations are presented that confirm the usefulness of our theoretical findings for PDE-based image compression.</description>

Abstract: The paper is devoted to the analysis of the global well-posedness and the interior regularity of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with inhomogeneous stochastic boundary conditions. The noise, white in time and coloured in space, can be interpreted as the physical law describing the driving mechanism on the atmosphere-ocean interface, i.e. as a balance of the shear stress of the ocean and the horizontal wind force.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of continuous solutions to balance laws and applications in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove H\"older regularity of any continuous solution $u$ to a $1$-D scalar balance law $u_t + [f(u)]_x = g$, when the source term $g$ is bounded and the flux $f$ is nonlinear of order $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\ell \ge 2$. For example, $\ell = 3$ if $f(u) = u^3$. Moreover, we prove that at almost every point $(t,x)$, it holds $u(t,x+h) - u(t,x) = o(|h|^{\frac{1}{\ell}})$ as $h \to 0$. Due to Lipschitz regularity along characteristics, this implies that at almost every point $(t,x)$, it holds $u(t+k,x+h) - u(t,x) = o((|h|+|k|)^{\frac{1}{\ell}})$ as $|(h,k)|\to 0$. We apply the results to provide a new proof of the Rademacher theorem for intrinsic Lipschitz functions in the first Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for the NLS hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness for higher-order equations in the so-called NLS hierarchy (also known as part of the AKNS hierarchy) in almost critical Fourier-Lebesgue spaces and in modulation spaces. We show the $j$th equation in the hierarchy is locally well-posed for initial data in $\hat H^s_r(\mathbb{R})$ for $s \ge \frac{j-1}{r'}$ and $1 &lt; r \le 2$ and also in $M^s_{2, p}(\mathbb{R})$ for $s = \frac{j-1}{2}$ and $2 \le p &lt; \infty$. Supplementing our results with corresponding ill-posedness results in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces shows optimality. Using the conserved quantities derived in Koch-Tataru (2018) we argue that the hierarchy equations are globally well-posed for data in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for $s \ge \frac{j-1}{2}$.
  Our arguments are based on the Fourier restriction norm method in Bourgain spaces adapted to our data spaces and bi- &amp; trilinear refinements of Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>Mean First Passage Times for Transport Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many transport processes in ecology, physics and biochemistry can be described by the average time to first find a site or exit a region, starting from an initial position. Typical mathematical treatments are based on formulations that allow for various diffusive forms and geometries but where only initial and final positions are taken into account. Here, we develop a general theory for the mean first passage time (MFPT) for velocity jump processes. For random walkers, both position and velocity are tracked and the resulting Fokker-Planck equation takes the form of a kinetic transport equation. Starting from the forward and backward formulations we derive a general elliptic integro-PDE for the MFPT of a random walker starting at a given location with a given velocity. We focus on two scenarios that are relevant to biological modelling; the diffusive case and the anisotropic case. For the anisotropic case we also perform a parabolic scaling, leading to a well known anisotropic MFPT equation. To illustrate the results we consider a two-dimensional circular domain under radial symmetry, where the MFPT equations can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, we consider the MFPT of a random walker in an ecological habitat that is perturbed by linear features, such as wolf movement in a forest habitat that is crossed by seismic lines.</description>

Zero becomes a spectrum point of the system operator when the coupling and thermal damping parameters of system satisfy specific conditions. We obtain the decay rates of solutions to the system with or without the inertial term. Furthermore, the decay rate of the system without inertial terms is shown to be optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport has proven to have numerous applications in data science. In some of those, differentiating the transport map with respect to the densities in the Fr\'echet sense is required. In this work, we prove that for a compact, uniformly convex set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a $\mathcal{C}^1$ curve of densities $\{p_t\} \subset \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\Omega)$ that are uniformly bounded away from zero and infinity, the curve of transport maps $\{\nabla \phi_t\} \subset \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\Omega)$, pushing $Q$ forward to $P_t$ (where $P_t$ admits density $p_t$ and $Q$ is sufficiently regular), is also $\mathcal{C}^1$. The proof is based on applying the implicit function theorem to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with natural boundary conditions. To achieve this, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the {\it linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation}, an elliptic partial differential equation characterized by strictly oblique boundary conditions and a null zero-order term. We emphasize two significant applications of this result. Firstly, it enables non-parametric inference on the Monge map, paving the way for the construction of confidence bands for the transport map. Secondly, it establishes the regularity of the transport-based quantile regression function with respect to the covariates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the heat diffusion equation in the whole Euclidean space consisting of two media locally with different constant conductivities, where initially one medium has temperature 0 and the other has temperature 1. Under the assumption that a part of the interface between two media with different constant conductivities is of class $C^2$ in a neighborhood of a point $x$ on it, we extract the mean curvature of the interface at $x$ from the initial behavior of temperature at $x$. This result is purely local in space. As a corollary, when the whole Euclidean space consists of two media globally with different constant conductivities, it is shown that if a connected component $\Gamma$ of the interface is of class $C^2$ and is stationary isothermic, then the mean curvature of $\Gamma$ must be constant. Moreover, we apply this result to some overdetermined problems for two-phase heat conductors and obtain some symmetry theorems.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the Couette flow for 2-D compressible Navier-Stokes equations (N-S) in an infinitely long flat torus $\Torus\times\R$. Compared to the incompressible flow, the compressible Couette flow has a stronger lift-up effect and weaker dissipation. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no work on the nonlinear stability in the cases of high Reynolds number until now and only linear stability was known in \cite{ADM2021,ZZZ2022}.In this paper, we study the nonlinear stability of 2-D compressible Couette flow in Sobolev space at high Reynolds numbers. Moreover, we also show the enhanced dissipation phenomenon and stability threshold for the compressible Couette flow.
  First, We decompose the perturbation into zero and non-zero modes and obtain two systems for these components, respectively. Different from \cite{ADM2021,ZZZ2022}, we use the anti-derivative technique to study the zero-mode system. We introduce a kind of diffusion wave to remove the excessive mass of the zero-modes and construct coupled diffusion waves along characteristics to improve the resulting time decay rates of error terms and derive a new integrated system \cref{anti}. Secondly, we observe a cancellation with the new system \cref{anti} so that the lift-up effect is weakened. Thirdly, the large time behavior of the zero-modes is obtained by the weighted energy method and a weighted inequality on the heat kernel \cite{HLM2010}.In addition, with the help of the Fourier multipliers method, we can show the enhanced dissipation phenomenon for the non-zero modes by commutator estimates to avoid loss of derivatives. Finally, we complete the higher-order derivative estimates to close the a priori assumptions by the energy method and show the stability threshold.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e and Sobolev inequalities with variable exponents and log-Holder continuity only at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Sobolev-Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e inequalities in variable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$, with $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ a bounded John domain, with weaker regularity assumptions on the exponent $p(\cdot)$ that have been used previously. In particular, we require $p(\cdot)$ to satisfy a new \emph{boundary $\log$-H\"older condition} that imposes some logarithmic decay on the oscillation of $p(\cdot)$ towards the boundary of the domain. Some control over the interior oscillation of $p(\cdot)$ is also needed, but it is given by a very general condition that allows $p(\cdot)$ to be discontinuous at every point of $\Omega$. Our results follows from a local-to-global argument based on the continuity of certain Hardy type operators. We provide examples that show that our boundary $\log$-H\"older condition is essentially necessary for our main results. The same examples are adapted to show that this condition is not sufficient for other related inequalities. Finally, we give an application to a Neumann problem for a degenerate $p(\cdot)$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Higher Order Boltzmann Equation for Hard Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we complete the program initiated by the first and second authors and rigorously derive a Boltzmann-type equation that incorporates higher order collisions among gas particles. More precisely, starting from a finite $N$-particle system where the particles can perform symmetric hard sphere type interactions up to arbitrarily high order $M$, we derive a kinetic equation which consists of a linear combination of higher order collisional terms. We identify the new scaling regime that facilitates such collisions and systematically generalize geometric techniques allowing us to analyze the correlation of potentially distinct order recollisions as time evolves.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of Leray-Hopf solutions for stochastic forced Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic forced Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ starting from zero initial condition. The noise is linear multiplicative and the equations are perturbed by an additional body force. Based on the ideas of Albritton, Bru\'e and Colombo \cite{ABC22}, we prove non-uniqueness of local-in-time Leray--Hopf solutions as well as joint non-uniqueness in law for solutions on $\mathbb{R}^{+}$. In the deterministic setting, we show that the set of forces, for which Leray--Hopf solutions are non-unique, is dense in $L^{1}_{t}L^{2}_{x}$. In addition, by a simple controllability argument we show that for every divergence-free initial condition in $L^{2}_{x}$ there is a force so that non-uniqueness of Leray--Hopf solutions holds.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Space-time White Noise and Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is an introduction to the theory of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), using the random field approach pioneered by J.B. Walsh (1986). The volume consists of two blocks: the core matter (Chapters 1 to 5) and the appendices (A, B and C). Chapter 1 introduces the subject, with a discussion of isonormal Gaussian processes, space-time white noise, and motivating examples of SPDEs. Chapter 2 presents a theory of stochastic integration with respect to space-time white noise. Chapter 3 deals with SPDEs with additive noise. In Chapter 4, we study a general class of SPDEs, in which additive and multiplicative nonlinearities appear. In Chapter 5, we present a selection of important topics in the theory of SPDEs, that have been the subject of much research over the last twenty years. Appendix A summarises the main results from the theory of stochastic processes and stochastic analysis that are used throughout the book. Appendix B is devoted to a systematic presentation of properties of fundamental solutions and Green's functions associated to the classical linear differential operators (heat, fractional heat and wave operators). Appendix C is a toolbox section. Each chapter is followed by a "Notes" section, which gives historically important references, original sources and points towards other related important contributions.</description>

      <title>Hairer-Quastel universality for KPZ -- polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of weakly asymmetric continuous microscopic growth models with polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and a Poisson type noise. We show that they converge to the KPZ equation after proper rescaling and re-centering, where the coupling constant depends nontrivially on all details of the smoothing and growth mechanisms in the microscopic model. This confirms some of the predictions in [HQ18], and provides a first example of Hairer-Quastel type with both a generic nonlinearity (non-polynomial) and a non-Gaussian noise.
  The proof builds on the general discretisation framework of regularity structures ([EH19]), and employs the idea of using the spectral gap inequality to control stochastic objects as developed and systematised in [LOTT21,HS24], together with a new observation on the specific structure of the (discrete) Malliavin derivatives in our situation. This structure enables us to reduce the control of mixed $L^p$ spacetime norms (of arbitrarily large $p$) by certain $L^2$-norms in spacetime.</description>
