      <title>Pair Space in Classical Mechanics III. Some Four-Body Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study central configurations in the four body problem, i.e., configurations in which the forces on all the bodies point to a fixed, single point in space. The newly formulated pair-space formalism yields a set of vectorial equations that fully characterize such configurations. We investigate a sub-class of solutions in which at least two pairs of inter-body distances are equal. The only such non-collinear configurations are the tetrahedron (the unique non-planar configuration), kites and the isosceles trapezium. The specific shapes (internal angles) are determined by the ratio of the masses of the bodies. Mathematical expression are given for all these relations.</description>

      <title>Adjoint L-Infinity Actions and Conserved Charges in GR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we compute the conserved currents and charges associated to the action of an infinitesimal isometry (Killing field) in Einstein--Cartan--Palatini gravity. We offer a new approach to these quantities through the formalism of $L_\infty$-algebras and the work of \'{C}iri\'{c}, Giotopoulos, Radovanovi\'{c}, and Szabo, and Costello and Gwilliam. We demonstrate our approach by computing the entropy of the Schwarzchild black hole. Along the way, we prove a purely algebraic result about the existence and utility of a higher (a full $\infty$) version of the adjoint action of an $L_\infty$-algebra.</description>

      <title>On spectral equations for an evolution operator of a $q$-oscillator lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a set of algebraic equations describing eigenvalues and eigenstates of a relativistic evolution operator for a two-dimensional $q$-oscillator Kagom\'e lattice. Evolution operator is constructed with the help of $q$-oscillator solution of the Tetrahedron Equation. We focus on the unitary regime of the evolution operator, so our results are related to 3d integrable systems of the quantum mechanics. Our conjecture is based on a two-dimensional lattice version of the coordinate Bethe-Ansatz.</description>

      <title>Quantum two-dimensional superintegrable systems in flat space: exact-solvability, hidden algebra, polynomial algebra of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short review paper the detailed analysis of six two-dimensional quantum {\it superintegrable} systems in flat space is presented. It includes the Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials I-II (the Holt potential), the Fokas-Lagerstrom model, the 3-body Calogero and Wolfes (equivalently, $G_2$ rational, or $I_6$) models, and the Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system with integer index $k$. It is shown that all of them are exactly-solvable, thus, confirming the Montreal conjecture (2001); they admit algebraic forms for the Hamiltonian and both integrals (all three can be written as differential operators with polynomial coefficients without a constant term), they have polynomial eigenfunctions with the invariants of the discrete symmetry group of invariance taken as variables, they have hidden (Lie) algebraic structure $g^{(k)}$ with various $k$, and they possess a (finite order) polynomial algebras of integrals. Each model is characterized by infinitely-many finite-dimensional invariant subspaces, which form the infinite flag. Each subspace coincides with the finite-dimensional representation space of the algebra $g^{(k)}$ for a certain $k$. In all presented cases the algebra of integrals is a 4-generated $(H, I_1, I_2, I_{12}\equiv[I_1, I_2])$ infinite-dimensional algebra of ordered monomials of degrees 2,3,4,5, which is a subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of the hidden algebra.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Network Analysis of Root Patterns in the XXX Model with Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string hypothesis for Bethe roots represents a cornerstone in the study of quantum integrable systems, providing access to physical quantities such as the ground-state energy and the finite-temperature free energy. While the $t-W$ scheme and the inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation have enabled significant methodological advances for systems with broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the underlying physics induced by symmetry breaking remains largely unexplored, due to the previously unknown distributions of the transfer-matrix roots. In this paper, we propose a new approach to determining the patterns of zero roots and Bethe roots for the $\Lambda-\theta$ and inhomogeneous Bethe ansatz equations using tensor-network algorithms. As an explicit example, we consider the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with non-diagonal boundary conditions. The exact structures of both zero roots and Bethe roots are obtained in the ground state for large system sizes, up to ($N\simeq 60$ and $100$). We find that even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, the Bethe and zero roots still exhibit a highly structured pattern. The zero roots organize into bulk strings, boundary strings, and additional roots, forming two dominant lines with boundary-string attachments. Correspondingly, the Bethe roots can be classified into four distinct types: regular roots, line roots, arc roots, and paired-line roots. These structures are associated with a real-axis line, a vertical line, characteristic arcs in the complex plane, and boundary-induced conjugate pairs. Comparative analysis reveals that the $t-W$ scheme generates significantly simpler root topologies than those obtained via off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz.</description>

      <title>Charge functions for all dimensional partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge functions for n-dimensional partitions are known for n=2,3,4 in the literature. We give the expression for arbitrary odd dimension in a recent work, and now further conjecture a formula for all even dimensional cases. This conjecture is proved rigorously for 6D, and numerically verified for 8D.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline Gibbs states in 4-dimensional lattice-gas models with finite-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions that has non-periodic, ``quasicrystalline'' Gibbs states at low temperatures. Such Gibbs states are probability measures which are small perturbations of non-periodic ground-state configurations corresponding to tilings of the plane with Ammann's aperiodic tiles. Our construction is based on the correspondence between probabilistic cellular automata and Gibbs measures on their space-time trajectories, and a classical result on noise-resilient computing with cellular automata. The cellular automaton is constructed on the basis of Ammann's tiles, which are deterministic in one direction, and has non-periodic space-time trajectories corresponding to each valid tiling. Repetitions along two extra dimensions, together with an error-correction mechanism, ensure stability of the trajectories subjected to noise.</description>

      <title>From Yang-Mills to Yang-Baxter: In Memory of Rodney Baxter and Chen--Ning Yang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The year 2025 marked the passing of two towering figures of twentieth-century mathematical physics, Rodney Baxter and Chen-Ning Yang. Yang reshaped modern physics through the introduction of non-abelian gauge theory and, independently, through the consistency conditions underlying what is now called the Yang-Baxter equation. Baxter transformed those conditions into a systematic theory of exact solvability in statistical mechanics and quantum integrable systems. This article is written in memory of Baxter and Yang, whose work revealed how local consistency principles generate global mathematical structure. We review the Yang-Mills formulation of gauge theory, its mass obstruction and resolution via symmetry breaking, and the geometric framework it engendered, including instantons, Donaldson-Floer theory, magnetic monopoles, and Hitchin systems. In parallel, we trace the emergence of the Yang-Baxter equation from factorised scattering to solvable lattice models, quantum groups, and Chern-Simons theory. Rather than separate narratives, gauge theory and integrability are presented as complementary manifestations of a shared coherence principle, an ongoing journey from gauge symmetry toward mathematical unity.</description>

      <title>Collective behaviors of an electron gas in the mean-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the momentum distribution of an electron gas in a $3$-dimensional torus. The goal is to compute the occupation number of Fourier modes for some trial state obtained through random phase approximation. We obtain the mean-field analogue of momentum distribution formulas for electron gas in [Daniel and Voskov, Phys. Rev. 120, (1960)] in high density limit and [Lam, Phys. Rev. \textbf{3}, (1971)] at metallic density. Our findings are related to recent results obtained independently by Benedikter, Lill and Naidu, and our analysis applies to a general class of singular potentials rather than just the Coulomb case.</description>

      <title>Products of random Hermitian matrices and brickwork Hurwitz numbers. Products of normal matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider products of $n$ random Hermitian matrices which generalize the one-matrix model and show its relation to Hurwitz numbers which count ramified coverings of certain type. Namely, these Hurwitz numbers count $2k$-fold ramified coverings of the Riemann sphere with arbitrary ramification type over $0$ and $\infty$ and ramifications related to the partition $(2^k)$ (``brickworks'' - involution without fixed points) elsewhere. Products of normal random matrices are also considered.</description>

      <title>Geometric approaches to Lie bialgebras, their classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This PhD Thesis consists of two parts. The first part focuses on novel algebraic and geometric approaches to the classification problem of coboundary Lie bialgebras up to Lie algebra automorphisms. More specifically, Grassmann, graded algebra and algebraic invariant techniques are discussed. Using these algebraic methods, equivalence classes of r-matrices for three-dimensional coboundary Lie bialgebras are studied. Moreover, particular higher-dimensional cases, e.g. $\mathfrak{so}(2,2)$ and $\mathfrak{so}(3,2)$, are partially analysed. From the geometric perspective, the main role is played by the newly introduced notion: the Darboux family. This powerful tool allows an efficient and thorough study of equivalence classes of r-matrices for four-dimensional indecomposable coboundary Lie bialgebras. In order to showcase its ability to tackle decomposable examples, $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ is additionally studied. The second part of the Thesis sketches interesting directions for applications of r-matrices. Firstly, it is illustrated how r-matrices might be useful to describe foliated Lie-Hamilton systems. Secondly, the role of r-matrices in deformations of certain cases of Lie systems is discussed. In particular, based on the general procedure for deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems, its extension to Jacobi-Lie systems is suggested and supported by the detailed computation of the deformed Schwarz equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerics to construct solitary waves in Dirac--Klein--Gordon (in one and three spatial dimensions) and study the dependence of energy and charge on $\omega$. For the construction, we use the iterative procedure, starting from solitary waves of nonlinear Dirac equation, computing the corresponding scalar field, and adjusting the coupling constant. We also consider the case of massless scalar field, when the iteration procedure could be compared with the shooting method. We use the virial identities to control the error of simulations. We also discuss possible implications from the obtained results for the spectral stability of solitary waves.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive bilinear tau forms of the canonically quantized Painlev\'e equations, thereby relating them to those previously obtained from the $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ blowup relations for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theory partition functions on a general $\Omega$-background. We fully fix the refined Painlev\'e/gauge theory dictionary by formulating the proper equations for the quantum nonautonomous Painlev\'e Hamiltonians. We also describe the symmetry structure of the quantum Painlev\'e tau functions and, as a byproduct of this analysis, obtain the $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ blowup relations in the nontrivial holonomy sector of the gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Hawksmoor's Ceiling, Mercator's Projection and the Roman Pantheon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ceiling of the Buttery in All Souls College, Oxford, designed by the English Baroque architect Nicholas Hawksmoor, has a vaulted form on an oval base. It is coffered with an array of approximately square sunken lacunaria, whose sizes and positions vary so as to accommodate the constraints of the curved surface and its boundaries. A similar design appears in the dome of the Roman Pantheon. Using methods of differential geometry, we hypothesise that these cofferings should be the images under conformal mappings of regular square tilings of a rectangle or finite cylinder. This guarantees that the coffer ribs meet exactly at right angles and the coffers are close to being square. These mappings are simply the inverse of Mercator's projection of the curved surface onto a plane. For a ceiling which is a general surface of revolution, we derive formulae for the dimensions and location of each coffer. Our results, taking into account camera distortion, are in excellent agreement with photographs of the Hawksmoor ceiling and the Pantheon dome, as well as with recent direct measurements of the latter. We also describe a protocol by which Hawksmoor's ceiling might have been constructed without advanced mathematics.</description>

Abstract: Given a m-dimensional Gaussian process and polynomial m variables with real coefficients, we calculate the induced path odered exponenial in two different ways: one is purely algebraic in spirit and the other one is diagrammatic in spirit and uses multigraph labelings (and is inspired by the use of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory).</description>

      <title>5D AGT conjecture for circular quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The best way to represent generic conformal blocks is provided by the free-field formalism, where they acquire a form of multiple Dotsenko-Fateev-like integrals of the screening operators. Degenerate conformal blocks can be described by the same integrals with special choice of parameters. Integrals satisfy various recurrent relations, which for the special choice of parameters reduce to closed equations. This setting is widely used in explaining the AGT relation, because similar integral representations exist also for Nekrasov functions. We extend this approach to the case of q-Virasoro conformal blocks on elliptic surface -- generic and degenerate. For the generic case, we check equivalence with instanton partition function of a 5d circular quiver gauge theory. For the degenerate case, we check equivalence with partition function of a defect in the same theory, also known as the Shiraishi function. We find agreement in both cases. This opens a way to re-derive the sophisticated equation for the Shiraishi function as the equation for the corresponding integral, what seems straightforward, but remains technically involved and is left for the future.</description>

      <title>Kinks in composite scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, families of kinks are analytically identified in multifield theories with either polynomial or deformed sine-Gordon-type potentials. The underlying procedure not only allows us to obtain analytical solutions for these models, but also provides a framework for constructing more general families of field theories that inherit certain analytical information about their solutions. Specifically, this method combines two known field theories into a new composite field theory whose target space is the product of the original target spaces. By suitably coupling the fields through a superpotential defined on the product space, the dynamics in the subspaces become entangled while preserving original kinks as boundary kinks. Different composite field theories are studied, including extensions of well-known models to wider target spaces.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Branches of Noncotangent Type: a Physics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Coulomb-branch sector of 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories with half-hypermultiplets in general pseudoreal representations $\mathbf{R}$ ("noncotangent" theories). This yields (short) quantization of the Coulomb branch and correlators of the Coulomb branch operators captured by the 1d topological sector. This is done by extending the hemisphere partition function approach to noncotangent matter. In this setting one must first cancel the parity anomaly, and overcome an obstacle that $(2,2)$ boundary conditions for half-hypers are generically incompatible with gauge symmetry. Using the Dirichlet boundary conditions for the gauge fields and a careful treatment of half-hypermultiplet boundary data, we describe the resulting shift/difference operators implementing monopole insertions (including bubbling effects) on $HS^3$, and use the $HS^3$ partition function as a natural module on which the Coulomb-branch operator algebra $\mathcal{A}_C$ is represented. As applications we derive generators and relations of $\mathcal{A}_C$ for $SU(2)$ theories with general matter (including half-integer spin representations), analyze theories with Coulomb branch $y^2=z(x^2-1)$, compute the Coulomb branch of an $A_n$ quiver with spin-$\frac32$ half-hypers, and check consistency of a general monopole-antimonopole two-point function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the moduli space of holomorphic $GL(1|1)$ Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface. The supergroup $GL(1|1)$, the simplest non-trivial example beyond abelian cases, provides an ideal setting for developing supergeometric analogues of classical results in Higgs bundle theory. We derive an explicit description of the moduli space and we study the analogue of the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem as well as the nonabelian Hodge correspondence. Furthermore, we formulate and solve the corresponding Hitchin equations, demonstrating their compatibility with fermionic contributions. As a highlight, we discuss the related Hitchin system on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and its integrability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first in a sequence of papers devoted to stable envelopes in critical cohomology and critical $K$-theory for symmetric GIT quotients with potentials and related geometries, and their applications to geometric representation theory and enumerative geometry. In this paper, we construct critical stable envelopes and establish their general properties, including compatibility with dimensional reductions, specializations, Hall products, and other geometric constructions. In particular, for tripled quivers with canonical cubic potentials, the critical stable envelopes reproduce those on Nakajima quiver varieties. These set up foundations for applications in subsequent papers.</description>

Abstract: We study the sine-Gordon measure defined on each homotopy class. The energy space decomposes into infinitely many such classes indexed by the topological degree $Q \in \mathbb{Z}$. Even though the sine-Gordon action admits no minimizer in homotopy classes with $|Q| \ge 2$, we prove that the Gibbs measure on each class nevertheless concentrates and exhibits Ornstein-Uhlenbeck fluctuations near the multi-soliton manifold in the joint low-temperature and infinite-volume limit. Furthermore, we show that the joint distribution of the multi-soliton centers coincides with the ordered statistics of independent uniform random variables, so that each soliton's location follows a Beta distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a family of one-dimensional stationary cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equations with periodic potentials and linear part displaying Dirac points in the dispersion relation. By introducing a suitable periodic perturbation, one can open a spectral gap around the Dirac-point energy. This allows to construct standing waves of the NLS equation whose leading-order profile is a modulation of Bloch waves by means of the components of a spinor solving an appropriate cubic nonlinear Dirac (NLD) equation. We refer to these solutions as Dirac solitons. Our analysis thus provides a rigorous justification for the use of the NLD equation as an effective model for the original NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Universality of cutoff for independent random walks on the circle conditioned not to intersect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider a class of Markov processes on the discrete circle which has been introduced by K\"onig, O'Connell and Roch. These processes describe movements of exchangeable interacting particles and are discrete analogues of the unitary Dyson Brownian motion: a random number of particles jump together either to the left or to the right, with trajectories conditioned to never intersect. We provide asymptotic mixing times for stochastic processes in this class as the number of particles goes to infinity, under a sub-Gaussian assumption on the random number of particles moving at each step. As a consequence, we prove that a cutoff phenomenon holds independently of the transition probabilities, subject only to the sub-Gaussian assumption and a minimal aperiodicity hypothesis. Finally, an application to dimer models on the hexagonal lattice is provided.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Lindblad description of the electron's radiative dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective model for describing the relativistic quantum dynamics of a radiating electron is developed via a relativistic generalization of the Lindblad master equation. By incorporating both radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations into the Dirac equation within an open quantum system framework, our approach captures the Zitterbewegung of the electron, ensuing noncommutativity of its effective spatial coordinates, and provides the quantum analogue of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) classical equation of motion with radiation reaction. We develop the corresponding phase-space representation via the relativistic Wigner function and derive the semiclassical limit through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter elucidates the signature of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the LL equation, and shows its relationship with the corrected Sokolov equation. Our results offer a robust framework for investigating quantum radiation reaction effects in ultrastrong laser fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful new framework for classifying and simulating correlated and topological phases of quantum matter. Their central premise is that strongly correlated matter can only be understood by studying the underlying entanglement structure and its associated (generalised) symmetries. In essence, tensor networks provide a compressed, holographic description of the complicated vacuum fluctuations in strongly correlated systems, and as such they break down the infamous many-body exponential wall. These lecture notes provide a concise overview of the most important conceptual, computational and mathematical aspects of this theory.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Theory for Photonic Hall Effect in Honeycomb Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a mathematical theory for the photonic Hall effect and prove the existence of guided electromagnetic waves at the interface of two honeycomb photonic crystals. The guided wave resembles the edge states in electronic systems: it is induced by the topological Hall effect, and the wave propagates along the interface but not in the bulk media. Starting from a symmetric honeycomb photonic crystal that attains Dirac points at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, $K$ and $K'$, we introduce two classes of perturbations for the periodic medium. The perturbations lift the Dirac degeneracy, forming a spectral band valley at the points $K$ and $K'$ with well-defined topological phase that depends on the sign of the perturbation parameters. By employing the layer potential techniques and spectral analysis, we investigate the existence of guided wave along an interface when two honeycomb photonic crystals are glued together. In particular, we elucidate the relationship between the existence of the interface mode and the nature of perturbations imposed on the two periodic media separated by the interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an evaluation of derivative-free optimization algorithms for the direct minimization of Hartree-Fock-Roothaan energy functionals involving nonlinear orbital parameters and quantum numbers with noninteger order. The analysis focuses on atomic calculations employing noninteger Slater-type orbitals. Analytic derivatives of the energy functional are not readily available for these orbitals. Four methods are investigated under identical numerical conditions: Powell's conjugate-direction method, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, coordinate-based pattern search, and a model-based algorithm utilizing radial basis functions for surrogate-model construction. Performance benchmarking is first performed using the Powell singular function, a well-established test case exhibiting challenging properties including Hessian singularity at the global minimum. The algorithms are then applied to Hartree-Fock-Roothaan self-consistent-field energy functionals, which define a highly non-convex optimization landscape due to the nonlinear coupling of orbital parameters. Illustrative examples are provided for closed$-$shell atomic configurations, specifically the He, Be isoelectronic series, with calculations performed for energy functionals involving up to eight nonlinear parameters.</description>

Abstract: We study the unitary almost Mathieu operator (UAMO), a one-dimensional quasi-periodic unitary operator arising from a two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk on $\mathbb Z^2$ in a homogeneous magnetic field. In the positive Lyapunov exponent regime $0\le \lambda_1&lt;\lambda_2\le 1$, we establish an arithmetic localization statement governed by the frequency exponent $\beta(\omega)$. More precisely, for every irrational $\omega$ with $\beta(\omega)&lt;L$, where $L&gt;0$ denotes the Lyapunov exponent, and every non-resonant phase $\theta$, we prove Anderson localization, i.e. pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions. This extends our previous arithmetic localization result for Diophantine frequencies (for which $\beta(\omega)=0$) to a sharp threshold in frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define two new indecomposable (not fully reducible) ${\cal N}=8$, $d=1$ off-shell multiplets and consider the corresponding models of ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric mechanics with spin variables. Each multiplet is described off shell by a scalar superfield which is a nonlinear deformation of the standard scalar superfield $X$ carrying the $d=1$ multiplet ${\bf (1,8,7)}$. Deformed systems involve, as invariant subsets, two different off-shell versions of the irreducible multiplet ${\bf (8,8,0)}$. For both systems we present the manifestly ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric superfield constraints, as well as the component off- and on-shell invariant actions, which for one version exactly match those given in arXiv:2402.00539 [hep-th]. The two models differ off shell, but prove to be equivalent to each other on shell, with the spin variables sitting in the adjoint representation of the maximal $R$-symmetry group ${\rm SO}(8)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply methods of equivariant homotopy theory, which may not previously have found due attention in condensed matter physics, to classify first the fragile/unstable topological phases of 2D crystalline Chern insulator materials, and second the possible topological order of their fractional cousins. We highlight that the phases are given by the equivariant 2-Cohomotopy of the Brillouin torus of crystal momenta (with respect to wallpaper point group actions) -- which, despite the attention devoted to crystalline Chern insulators, seems not to have been considered before. Arguing then that any topological order must be reflected in the adiabatic monodromy of gapped quantum ground states over the covariantized space of these band topologies, we compute the latter in examples where this group is non-abelian, showing that any potential FQAH anyons must be localized in momentum space. We close with an outlook on the relevance for the search for topological quantum computing hardware. Mathematical details are spelled out in a supplement.</description>

      <title>T-duality for toric manifolds in $\mathcal{N}=(2, 2)$ superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the situation when the T-dual of a toric K\"ahler geometry is a generalized K\"ahler geometry involving semi-chiral fields. We explain that this situation is generic for polycylinders, tori and related geometries. Gauging multiple isometries in this case requires the introduction of semi-chiral gauge fields on top of the standard ones. We then apply this technology to the generalized K\"ahler geometry of the $\eta$-deformed $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$ model, relating it to the K\"ahler geometry of its T-dual.</description>

      <title>Phase Reduction of Limit Cycle Oscillators: A Tutorial Review with New Perspectives on Isochrons and an Outlook to Higher-Order Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase reduction technique is essential for studying rhythmic phenomena across various scientific fields. It allows the complex dynamics of high-dimensional oscillatory systems to be expressed by a single phase variable. This paper provides a detailed review and synthesis of phase reduction with two main goals. First, we develop a solid geometric framework for the theory by creating isochrons, which are the level sets of the asymptotic phase, using the Graph Transform theorem. We show that isochrons form an invariant, continuous structure of the basin of attraction of a stable limit cycle, helping to clarify the concept of the asymptotic phase. Second, we systematically explain how to derive the first-order phase reduction for weakly perturbed and coupled systems. In the end, we discuss the limitations of the first-order approach, particularly its restriction to very small perturbations and the issue of vanishing coupling terms in certain networks. We finish by outlining the framework and importance of higher-order phase reductions. This establishes a clear link from classical theory to modern developments and sets the stage for a more in-depth discussion in a future publication.</description>

      <title>Twisted Cherednik systems and non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenfunctions of many-body system Hamiltonians associated with generalized (a-twisted) Cherednik operators used in construction of other Hamiltonians: those arising from commutative subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series.</description>

      <title>Four collapsing one-dimensional particles: a dynamical system approach of the spherical billiard reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of four one-dimensional inelastic hard spheres evolving on the real line $\mathbb{R}$, and colliding according to a scattering law characterized by a fixed restitution coefficient $r$. We study the possible orders of collisions when the inelastic collapse occurs, relying on the so-called $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping, a two-dimensional dynamical system associated to the original particle system which encodes all the possible collision orders. We prove that the $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping is a piecewise projective transformation, which allows one to perform efficient numerical simulations of its orbits. We recover previously known results concerning the one-dimensional four-particle inelastic hard sphere system and we support the conjectures stated in the literature concerning particular periodic orbits. We discover three new families of periodic orbits that coexist depending on the restitution coefficient, we prove rigorously that there exist stable periodic orbits for the $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping for restitution coefficients larger than the upper bounds previously known, and we prove the existence of quasi-periodic orbits for this mapping.</description>

      <title>Classical integrability in 2D and asymptotic symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are a contribution to the proceedings of the school "Geometric, Algebraic and Topological Methods for Quantum Field Theory", held in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, from 31st of July to 9th of August 2023. Its intention is to put together several basic tools of classical integrability and contrast them with those available in the formulation of asymptotic symmetries and the definition of canonical charges in gauge theories. We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $\Lambda&lt;0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form.</description>

Abstract: We study the Chern-Weil theory for the primitive cohomology of a symplectic manifold. First, given a symplectic manifold, we review the superbundle-valued forms on this manifold and prove a primitive version of the Bianchi identity. Second, as the main result, we prove a transgression formula associated with the boundary map of the primitive cohomology. Third, as an application of the main result, we introduce the concept of primitive characteristic classes and point out a further direction.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the question of defining a $p$-adic string worldsheet action in genus one, we define a Laplacian operator on the Tate curve, and study its Green's function. We show that the Green's function exists. We provide an explicit formula for the Green's function, which turns out to be a non-Archimedean counterpart of the Archimedean Green's function on a flat torus.</description>

      <title>Modelling the movements of organisms by stochastic theory in a comoving frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine you walk in a plane. You move by making a step of a certain length per time interval in a chosen direction. Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.</description>

Abstract: We investigate BPS states in 4d N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the corresponding (p, q) string networks in Type IIB string theory. We propose a new interpretation of the algebra of line operators in this theory as a tensor product of vector representations of a quantum toroidal algebra, which determines protected spin characters of all framed BPS states. We identify the SL(2,Z)-noninvariant choice of the coproduct in the quantum toroidal algebra with the choice of supersymmetry subalgebra preserved by the BPS states and interpret wall crossing operators as Drinfeld twists of the coproduct. Kontsevich-Soibelman spectrum generator is then identified with Khoroshkin-Tolstoy universal R-matrix.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we present a characterization of semistable unitary operators on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, under the assumption that the operator is (i) translation-invariant, (ii) symmetric, and (iii) locally uniformly continuous (LUC) under dilation. As a consequence, we characterize one-parameter groups formed by such operators, which are of the form $e^{i\beta t|{d}/{dx}|^\alpha}$, with $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R$.</description>

      <title>Detector Response Matrices, Effective Areas, and Flash-Effective Areas for Radiation Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Detector Response Matrix (DRM) is a discrete representation of an instrument's Detector Response Function (DRF), which quantifies how many discrete energy depositions occur in a detector volume for a given distribution of particles incident on the detector. For simple radiation detectors that can count such energy depositions (such as scintillators, Proportional Counter Tubes (PCTs), etc), we consider the ideal counting DRF, $\mathbf{G}_\varphi (E_\mathrm{in}, E_\mathrm{dep})$, which relates the detector's counting histogram (number of energy depositions within a given channel) to an incident particles characterization, $\varphi$ (e.g. incident flux, fluence, intensity). From the counting DRF we can derive the counting DRM, the effective area, and the flash effective area (which measures the total energy deposited in the detector from a large, instantaneous fluence).</description>

Abstract: We formulate the covariant hydrodynamics equations describing the fluid dynamics as the problem of intersection theory on the infinite dimensional symplectic manifold associated with spacetime. This point of view separates the structures related to the equation of state, the geometry of spacetime, and structures related to the (differential) topology of spacetime. We point out a five-dimensional origin of the formalism of Lichnerowicz and Carter. Our formalism also incorporates the chiral anomaly and Onsager quantization. We clarify the relation between the canonical velocity and Landau $4$-velocity, the meaning of Kelvin's theorem. Finally, we discuss some connections to topological strings, Poisson sigma models, and topological field theories in various dimensions.</description>

By invoking Tarski fixed point theorem, we identify physical theories as least fixed points of admissibility constraints derived from Galois connections. We demonstrate that QED and General Relativity can be represented in such a logical structure with respect to their symmetry and locality principles.</description>

      <title>Local Laws and Fluctuations for Super-Coulombic Riesz Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local statistical behavior of the super-Coulombic Riesz gas of particles in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension, with inverse power distance repulsion integrable near $0$, and with a general confinement potential, in a certain regime of inverse temperature. Using a bootstrap procedure, we prove local laws on the next order energy and control on fluctuations of linear statistics that are valid down to the microscopic lengthscale, and provide controls for instance, on the number of particles in a (mesoscopic or microscopic) box, and the existence of a limit point process up to subsequences.
  As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field.
  Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Lebl\'e and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the simplest example of the landscape of conformal field theories: one-dimensional CFTs with finite-dimensional state space. Following the definition of quantum field theory given by G. Segal, we formulate the condition under which a one-dimensional QFT (quantum mechanics) possesses conformal symmetry, and we give a complete classification of conformal Hamiltonians with finite rank. It turns out that correlation functions in such theories are polynomial functions of the underlying geometric data. Moreover, the one-dimensional conformal Ward identities determine their scaling behavior, so that the correlators of the conformal observables are, in fact, homogeneous polynomials.</description>

Abstract: To construct a BPS algebra with representations furnished by n-dimensional partitions, the first step is to construct the eigenvalue of the Cartan operators acting on them. The generating function of the eigenvalues is called the charge function. It has an important property that for each partition, the poles of the function correspond to the projection of the boxes which can be added to or removed from the partition legally. The charge functions of lower dimensional partitions, i.e., Young diagrams for 2D, plane partitions for 3D and solid partitions for 4D, are already given in the literature. In this paper, we propose an expression of the charge function for arbitrary odd dimensional partitions and have it proved for 5D case. Some explicit numerical tests for 7D and 9D case are also conducted to confirm our formula.</description>

Abstract: We study the deviation from proportionality of rows and columns in products of positive matrices. We prove a sharp, dimension-free bound showing that worst-case misalignment is already captured in dimension two and follows an explicit Mobius law, refining the classical Birkhoff-Bushell contraction theory.</description>

      <title>Teleportation=Translation: Continuous recovery of black hole information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \textit{Teleportation=Translation} conjecture posits that the recovery of information from a black hole is dual to a geometric translation in the emergent spacetime. In this paper, we establish this equivalence by constructing a continuous family of unitaries that bridges the discrete algebraic teleportation protocol and modular flow. We resolve the failure of dynamic idempotency, inherent in Type III von Neumann algebras, by employing the Haagerup-Kosaki crosse-product construction. This lift to the semifinite envelope yields a canonical, dynamically consistent path whose unique self-adjoint generator $\tilde{G}$ is proven to be twice the modular Hamiltonian difference, $\tilde{G}=2(K_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}-K_{\tilde{\mathcal{N}}})$. We establish this identity as a closed operator equivalence using Nelson's analytic vector theorem and quantify its structural robustness via Kosaki's non-commutative $L^p$ theory. Our results provide a concrete analytic mechanism for probing emergent geometry from quantum information, offering a kinematic framework naturally extendable to include gravitational back-reaction.</description>

      <title>Towards a mirror theorem for GLSMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12360v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for computing generating functions of genus-zero invariants of a gauged linear sigma model $(V, G, \theta, w)$. We show that certain derivatives of $I$-functions of quasimap invariants of $[V //_\theta G]$ produce $I$-functions (appropriately defined) of the GLSM. When $G$ is an algebraic torus we obtain an explicit formula for an $I$-function, and check that it agrees with previously computed $I$-functions in known special cases. Our approach is based on a new construction of GLSM invariants which applies whenever the evaluation maps from the moduli space are proper, and includes insertions from light marked points.</description>

      <title>Forward-backward stochastic simulations: Q-based model for measurement and Bell-nonlocality consistent with weak local realistic premises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06070v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how measurement and nonlocality can be explained consistently with macroscopic realism and no-signaling, and causal relations for macroscopic quantities. Considering measurement of a field amplitude $\hat{x}$, we derive theorems that lead to an equivalence between a quantum phase-space probability distribution Q(x,p,t) and stochastic trajectories for real amplitudes x and p propagating backwards and forwards in time, respectively. We present forward-backward stochastic simulations that motivate a Q-based model of reality. Amplification plays a key role in measurement. With amplification, contributions due to interference become unobservable, leading to branches that correspond to distinct eigenvalues. This elucidates how the system evolves from a superposition to an eigenstate, from which Born's rule follows. We deduce a hybrid causal structure involving causal deterministic relations for amplified variables, along with microscopic noise inputs and hidden loops for unobservable quantities. Causal consistency is confirmed. The simulations allow evaluation of a state inferred for the system, conditioned on a particular branch, from which we deduce a model for projection and collapse of the wave function. The theory is extended to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell nonlocality. We demonstrate consistency with three weak local realistic premises: the existence of real properties (defined after operations that fix measurement settings); a partial locality implying no-signaling; elements of reality that apply to the predictions of a system by a meter, once meter-settings are fixed. A mechanism for non-locality is identified. Our work shows how forward-backward stochastic simulations lead to a hybrid causal structure, involving both deterministic causal relations and hidden stochastic loops, explaining measurement and entanglement, with paradoxes associated with retrocausality avoided.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal minimal models and their fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal minimal models are the first series of unitary conformal field theories (CFTs) extending beyond Virasoro algebra. Using coset constructions, we characterize CFTs in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal minimal models using combinations of a parafermion theory, an Ising theory and a free boson theory. Supercurrent operators in the original theory also becomes sums of operators from each constituent theory. If we take our $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal theories as the neutral part of the edge theory of a fractional quantum Hall state, we present a systematic way of calculating its ground state wavefunction using free field methods. Each ground state wavefunction is known previously as a sum of polynomials with distinct clustering behaviours. Based on our decomposition, we find explicit expressions for each summand polynomial. A brief generalization to $S_3$ minimal models using coset construction is also included.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. We show that the coefficients of the expansion are given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, whose first variations can be expressed through the TYZ expansion coefficients of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. We further show that Futaki-type holomorphic invariants obstruct the existence of critical points of these geometric functionals, extending Lu's formula. We also verify that certain formulas remain valid up to the third coefficient without assuming polarization. Finally, we discuss the relation of our results to the quantum Hall effect (QHE), where the determinantal point process provides a microscopic model. In particular, we recover the higher-dimensional effective Chern-Simons actions derived in the physics literature and confirm a conjecture of Klevtsov on the form of the partition function asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Classical Estimation of the Free Energy and Quantum Gibbs Sampling from the Markov Entropy Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Markov Entropy Decomposition, a classical convex relaxation algorithm introduced by Poulin and Hastings to approximate the free energy in quantum spin lattices. We identify a sufficient condition for its convergence, namely the decay of the effective interaction. The effective interaction, also known as Hamiltonians of mean force, is a widely established correlation measure, and we show our decay condition in 1D at any temperature as well as in the high-temperature regime under a certain commutativity condition on the Hamiltonian building on existing results. This yields polynomial and quasi-polynomial time approximation algorithms in these settings, respectively. Furthermore, the decay of the effective interaction implies the decay of the conditional mutual information for the Gibbs state of the system. We then use this fact to devise a rounding scheme that maps the solution of the convex relaxation to a global state and show that the scheme can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, thus proving efficiency of quantum Gibbs sampling under our assumption of decay of the effective interaction.</description>

      <title>Lack-of-fit reduction in the path-integral formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The formulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to find reduced dynamical equations by minimizing information discrepancy with respect to the detailed evolution. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reduction method is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy).</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$, namely (functional) proportionality between the Cotton-York tensor field and the holographic stress tensor field at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars. The results are compatible with any matter content of the physical spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Spectral degeneracies, including diabolic (DP) and exceptional (EP) points, exhibit unique sensitivity to external perturbations, enabling powerful control and engineering of wave phenomena. We present a residue-based perturbation theory that quantifies complex resonance splitting of DP and EP type spectral degeneracies using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We validate our theory using both analytic Hamiltonian models and numerical electromagnetic simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a range of cases. Our approach accurately predicts degenerate resonance splitting using only scattering data, offering a powerful framework for precision tuning, inverse design, and practical exploitation of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Optically Controlled Skyrmion Number Current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to control the motion of magnetic Skyrmions through the generation of a Skyrmion number current. This current is induced and tuned by an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian that includes a Zeeman term arising from the interaction between the spin system and circularly polarized light. To capture the effect, we apply a first-order perturbation method to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, using a breathing Skyrmion ansatz based on the Belavin-Polyakov profile. This approach reveals that the time-dependent deformation of the Skyrmion boundary produces an anisotropic breathing mode, which in turn generates a nonzero Skyrmion number current. The resulting dynamics in momentum space form a limit cycle, whose characteristics depend on the external magnetic field amplitude, the Heisenberg exchange coupling, and the Gilbert damping constant. Our formulation not only clarifies the topological origin of optically driven Skyrmion motion but also points to Skyrmion number currents as a low-dissipation alternative to electric currents for efficient Skyrmion control.</description>

      <title>Quiver superconformal index and giant gravitons: asymptotics and expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the asymmetric version of the Popkov-Sch\"{u}tz two-lane lattice gas with general jump rates, subject to the stationary measure being of product form. This still leaves five free parameters. At density 1/2 the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian are degenerate. We compute the second order expansion of the average fluxes at density 1/2 and thereby identify the universality classes.</description>

      <title>Results on Lorentzian metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a short introduction to ``Lorentzian metric spaces" i.e., spacetimes defined solely in terms of the two-point Lorentzian distance. As noted in previous work, this structure is essentially unique if minimal conditions are imposed, such as the continuity of the Lorentzian distance and the relative compactness of chronological diamonds. The latter condition is natural for interpreting these spaces as low-regularity versions of globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Confirming this interpretation, we prove that every Lorentzian metric space admits a Cauchy time function. The proof is constructive for this general setting and it provides a novel argument that is interesting already for smooth spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>

      <title>Universal Geometric Framework for Black Hole Phase Transitions: From Multivaluedness to Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed synchronized multivalued behavior in thermodynamic, dynamical, and geometric quantities during the black hole first-order phase transition, which enables a diagnosis from different perspectives, yet its fundamental origin has remained poorly understood. By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality and Multiplicative Structures on Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum LDPC codes have attracted intense interest due to their advantageous properties for realizing efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincar\'e duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.
  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincar\'e duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\mathrm{C}Z}=\Theta(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes. Moreover, we provide multiple new methods to construct transversal circuits composed of $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{C}Z$ gates as well as for higher order controlled-$Z$ that are provably logical operations on the code space. We conjecture that they generate nontrivial logical actions, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates on nearly optimal qLDPC sheaf codes. Mathematically, our results are built on establishing the equivalence between sheaf cohomology in the derived-functor sense, \v{C}ech cohomology, and the cohomology of sheaf codes, thereby introducing new mathematical tools into quantum coding theory.</description>
