      <title>The Vertex-Attribute-Constrained Densest $k$-Subgraph Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense subgraph mining is a fundamental technique in graph mining, commonly applied in fraud detection, community detection, product recommendation, and document summarization. In such applications, we are often interested in identifying communities, recommendations, or summaries that reflect different constituencies, styles or genres, and points of view. For this task, we introduce a new variant of the Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem that incorporates the attribute values of vertices. The proposed Vertex-Attribute-Constrained Densest $k$-Subgraph (VAC-D$k$S) problem retains the NP-hardness and inapproximability properties of the classical D$k$S. Nevertheless, we prove that a suitable continuous relaxation of VAC-D$k$S is tight and can be efficiently tackled using a projection-free Frank--Wolfe algorithm. We also present an insightful analysis of the optimization landscape of the relaxed problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed formulation and algorithm, and its ability to scale up to large graphs. We further elucidate the properties of VAC-D$k$S versus classical D$k$S in a political network mining application, where VAC-D$k$S identifies a balanced and more meaningful set of politicians representing different ideological camps, in contrast to the classical D$k$S solution which is unbalanced and rather mundane.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Machine Learning Ecosystem: 2 Million Models on Hugging Face</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive pattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the structure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on Hugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our study of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their base or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in size and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we use model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and mutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a family resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more overlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities depart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because mutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit more similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional drifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine learning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive, commercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation of upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility towards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and standardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated text. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded understanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and methods can yield novel scientific insights.</description>

      <title>Propagation Tree Is Not Deep: Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning Approach for Rumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rumor detection on social media has become increasingly important. Most existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However, through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning (RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2) retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured graphs.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-World Rumor Detection: Anomaly Detection Framework with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current rumor detection methods based on propagation structure learning predominately treat rumor detection as a class-balanced classification task on limited labeled data. However, real-world social media data exhibits an imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts. To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data distributions.</description>

      <title>FLUID: Flow-Latent Unified Integration via Token Distillation for Expert Specialization in Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal classification requires robust integration of visual and textual signals, yet common fusion strategies are brittle and vulnerable to modality-specific noise. In this paper, we present \textsc{FLUID}-Flow-Latent Unified Integration via Token Distillation for Expert Specialization, a principled token-level pipeline that improves cross-modal robustness and scalability. \textsc{FLUID} contributes three core elements: (1) \emph{Q-transforms}, learnable query tokens that distill and retain salient token-level features from modality-specific backbones; (2) a two-stage fusion scheme that enforces cross-modal consistency via contrastive alignment and then performs adaptive, task-aware fusion through a gating mechanism and a \emph{Q-bottleneck} that selectively compresses information for downstream reasoning; and (3) a lightweight, load-balanced Mixture-of-Experts at prediction time that enables efficient specialization to diverse semantic patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{FLUID} attains \(91\%\) accuracy on the GLAMI-1M benchmark, significantly outperforming prior baselines and exhibiting strong resilience to label noise, long-tail class imbalance, and semantic heterogeneity. Targeted ablation studies corroborate both the individual and synergistic benefits of the proposed components, positioning \textsc{FLUID} as a scalable, noise-resilient solution for multimodal product classification.</description>

      <title>Recovering link-weight structure in complex networks with weight-aware random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using edge weights is essential for modeling real-world systems where links possess relevant information, and preserving this information in low-dimensional representations is relevant for classification and prediction tasks. This paper systematically investigates how different random walk strategies - traditional unweighted, strength-based, and fully weight-aware - keeps edge weight information when generating node embeddings. Using network models, real-world graphs, and networks subjected to low-weight edge removal, we measured the correlation between original edge weights and the similarity of node pairs in the embedding space generated by random walk strategies. Our results consistently showed that weight-aware random walks significantly outperform other strategies, achieving correlations above 0.90 in network models. However, performance in real-world networks was more heterogeneous, influenced by factors like topology and weight distribution. Our analysis also revealed that removing weak edges via thresholding can initially improve correlation by reducing noise, but excessive pruning degrades representation quality. Our findings suggest that simply using a weight-aware random walk is generally the best approach for preserving node weight information in embeddings, but it is not a universal solution.</description>

      <title>From Platform Migration to Cultural Integration: the Ingress and Diffusion of #wlw from TikTok to RedNote in Queer Women</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hashtags serve as identity markers and connection tools in online queer communities. Recently, the Western-origin #wlw (women-loving-women) hashtag has risen in the Chinese lesbian community on RedNote, coinciding with user migration triggered by the temporary US TikTok ban. This event provides a unique lens to study cross-cultural hashtag ingress and diffusion through the populations' responsive behaviors in cyber-migration. In this paper, we conducted a two-phase content analysis of 418 #wlw posts from January and April, examining different usage patterns during the hashtag's ingress and diffusion. Results indicate that the successful introduction of #wlw was facilitated by TikTok immigrants' bold importation, both populations' mutual interpretation, and RedNote natives' discussions. In current manifestation of diffusion, #wlw becomes a RedNote-recognized queer hashtag for sharing queer life, and semantically expands to support feminism discourse. Our findings provide empirical insights for enhancing the marginalized communities' cross-cultural communication.</description>

      <title>Fabricating Holiness: Characterizing Religious Misinformation Circulators on Arabic Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation is a growing concern in a decade involving critical global events. While social media regulation is mainly dedicated towards the detection and prevention of fake news and political misinformation, there is limited research about religious misinformation which has only been addressed through qualitative approaches. In this work, we study the spread of fabricated quotes (Hadith) that are claimed to belong to Prophet Muhammad (the prophet of Islam) as a case study demonstrating one of the most common religious misinformation forms on Arabic social media. We attempt through quantitative methods to understand the characteristics of social media users who interact with fabricated Hadith. We spotted users who frequently circulate fabricated Hadith and others who frequently debunk it to understand the main differences between the two groups. We used Logistic Regression to automatically predict their behaviors and analyzed its weights to gain insights about the characteristics and interests of each group. We find that both fabricated Hadith circulators and debunkers have generally a lot of ties to religious accounts. However, circulators are identified by many accounts that follow the Shia branch of Islam, Sunni Islamic public figures from the gulf countries, and many Sunni non-professional pages posting Islamic content. On the other hand, debunkers are identified by following academic Islamic scholars from multiple countries and by having more intellectual non-religious interests like charity, politics, and activism.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Network Games: $\alpha$-Potential Function and Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a network game, players interact over a network and the utility of each player depends on his own action and on an aggregate of his neighbours' actions. Many real world networks of interest are asymmetric and involve a large number of heterogeneous players. This paper analyzes static network games using the framework of $\alpha$-potential games. Under mild assumptions on the action sets (compact intervals) and the utility functions (twice continuously differentiable) of the players, we derive an expression for an inexact potential function of the game, called the $\alpha$-potential function. Using such a function, we show that modified versions of the sequential best-response algorithm and the simultaneous gradient play algorithm achieve convergence of players' actions to a $2\alpha$-Nash equilibrium. For linear-quadratic network games, we show that $\alpha$ depends on the maximum asymmetry in the network and is well-behaved for a wide range of networks of practical interest. Further, we derive bounds on the social welfare of the $\alpha$-Nash equilibrium corresponding to the maximum of the $\alpha$-potential function, under suitable assumptions. We numerically illustrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms and properties of the learned $2\alpha$-Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Rumor Detection Methods with Propagation Structure Infused Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have excelled in various Natural Language Processing tasks, benefiting from large-scale pretraining and self-attention mechanism's ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their performance on social media application tasks like rumor detection remains suboptimal. We attribute this to mismatches between pretraining corpora and social texts, inadequate handling of unique social symbols, and pretraining tasks ill-suited for modeling user engagements implicit in propagation structures. To address these issues, we propose a continue pretraining strategy called Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to infuse information from propagation structures into PLMs. PEP makes models to predict root, branch, and parent relations between posts, capturing interactions of stance and sentiment crucial for rumor detection. We also curate and release large-scale Twitter corpus: TwitterCorpus (269GB text), and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with propagation structures (UTwitter and UWeibo). Utilizing these resources and PEP strategy, we train a Twitter-tailored PLM called SoLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across universal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark datasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\% accuracy, even enabling it to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM alone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results, highlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post interaction features.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Agentic Service Ecosystems: Measurement, Analysis, and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Agentic Service Ecosystem consists of heterogeneous autonomous agents (e.g., intelligent machines, humans, and human-machine hybrid systems) that interact through resource exchange and service co-creation. These agents, with distinct behaviors and motivations, exhibit autonomous perception, reasoning, and action capabilities, which increase system complexity and make traditional linear analysis methods inadequate. Swarm intelligence, characterized by decentralization, self-organization, emergence, and dynamic adaptability, offers a novel theoretical lens and methodology for understanding and optimizing such ecosystems. However, current research, owing to fragmented perspectives and cross-ecosystem differences, fails to comprehensively capture the complexity of swarm-intelligence emergence in agentic contexts. The lack of a unified methodology further limits the depth and systematic treatment of the research. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing the emergence of swarm intelligence in Agentic Service Ecosystems, with three steps: measurement, analysis, and optimization, to reveal the cyclical mechanisms and quantitative criteria that foster emergence. By reviewing existing technologies, the paper analyzes their strengths and limitations, identifies unresolved challenges, and shows how this framework provides both theoretical support and actionable methods for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>On Densest $k$-Subgraph Mining and Diagonal Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem aims to find a subgraph comprising $k$ vertices with the maximum number of edges between them. A continuous relaxation of the binary quadratic D$k$S problem is considered, which incorporates a diagonal loading term. It is shown that this non-convex, continuous relaxation is tight for a range of diagonal loading parameters, and the impact of the diagonal loading parameter on the optimization landscape is studied. On the algorithmic side, two projection-free algorithms are proposed to tackle the relaxed problem, based on Frank--Wolfe and explicit constraint parameterization, respectively. Experiments suggest that both algorithms have merits relative to the state-of-art, while the Frank--Wolfe-based algorithm stands out in terms of subgraph density, computational complexity, and ability to scale up to very large datasets.</description>

      <title>Delayed takedown of illegal content on social media makes moderation ineffective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Illegal content on social media poses significant societal harm and necessitates timely removal. However, the impact of the speed of content removal on prevalence, reach, and exposure to illegal content remains underexplored. This study examines the relationship with a systematic analysis of takedown delays using data from the EU Digital Services Act Transparency Database, covering five major platforms over a one-year period. We find substantial variation in takedown delay, with some content remaining online for weeks or even months. To evaluate how these delays affect the prevalence and reach of illegal content and exposure to it, we develop an agent-based model and calibrate it to empirical data. We simulate illegal content diffusion, revealing that rapid takedown (within hours) significantly reduces prevalence, reach, and exposure to illegal content, while longer delays fail to reduce its spread. Though the effect of delay may seem intuitive, our simulations quantify exactly how takedown speed shapes the spread of illegal content. Building on these results, we point to the benefits of faster content removal to effectively curb the spread of illegal content, while also considering the limitations of strict enforcement policies.</description>

Abstract: Most social applications, from Twitter to Wikipedia, have rigid one-size-fits-all designs, but building new social applications is both technically challenging and results in applications that are siloed away from existing communities. We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all without losing their friends or data.
  Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate. Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by accident, avoiding context collapse.
  Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built a Vue plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter, Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader ecosystem that Graffiti enables.</description>

      <title>Community-Aware Social Community Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Social recommendation, which seeks to leverage social ties among users to alleviate the sparsity issue of user-item interactions, has emerged as a popular technique for elevating personalized services in recommender systems. Despite being effective, existing social recommendation models are mainly devised for recommending regular items such as blogs, images, and products, and largely fail for community recommendations due to overlooking the unique characteristics of communities. Distinctly, communities are constituted by individuals, who present high dynamicity and relate to rich structural patterns in social networks. To our knowledge, limited research has been devoted to comprehensively exploiting this information for recommending communities.
  To bridge this gap, this paper presents CASO, a novel and effective model specially designed for social community recommendation. Under the hood, CASO harnesses three carefully-crafted encoders for user embedding, wherein two of them extract community-related global and local structures from the social network via social modularity maximization and social closeness aggregation, while the third one captures user preferences using collaborative filtering with observed user-community affiliations. To further eliminate feature redundancy therein, we introduce a mutual exclusion between social and collaborative signals. Finally, CASO includes a community detection loss in the model optimization, thereby producing community-aware embeddings for communities. Our extensive experiments evaluating CASO against nine strong baselines on six real-world social networks demonstrate its consistent and remarkable superiority over the state of the art in terms of community recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Empathy Detection from Text, Audiovisual, Audio or Physiological Signals: A Systematic Review of Task Formulations and Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00721</link>

Abstract: Empathy indicates an individual's ability to understand others. Over the past few years, empathy has drawn attention from various disciplines, including but not limited to Affective Computing, Cognitive Science, and Psychology. Detecting empathy has potential applications in society, healthcare and education. Despite being a broad and overlapping topic, the avenue of empathy detection leveraging Machine Learning remains underexplored from a systematic literature review perspective. We collected 849 papers from 10 well-known academic databases, systematically screened them and analysed the final 82 papers. Our analyses reveal several prominent task formulations - including empathy on localised utterances or overall expressions, unidirectional or parallel empathy, and emotional contagion - in monadic, dyadic and group interactions. Empathy detection methods are summarised based on four input modalities - text, audiovisual, audio and physiological signals - thereby presenting modality-specific network architecture design protocols. We discuss challenges, research gaps and potential applications in the Affective Computing-based empathy domain, which can facilitate new avenues of exploration. We further enlist the public availability of datasets and codes. This paper, therefore, provides a structured overview of recent advancements and remaining challenges towards developing a robust empathy detection system that could meaningfully contribute to enhancing human well-being.</description>

      <title>Invisible Walls in Cities: Leveraging Large Language Models to Predict Urban Segregation Experience with Social Media Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding experienced segregation in urban daily life is crucial for addressing societal inequalities and fostering inclusivity. The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.</description>

      <title>Organizations, teams, and job mobility: A social microdynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the modeling approaches used to understand organizational worker mobility are highly stylized, using idealizations such as structureless organizations, indistinguishable workers, and a lack of social bonding of the workers. In this article, aided by a decade of precise, temporally resolved data of a large civilian organization of the US Army in which employees can change jobs in a similar way to many private organizations, we introduce a new framework to describe organizations as composites of teams within which individuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop. By tracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that workers who change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with past coworkers. In this organization, 34% of all moves across temporally stable teams (and 32% of the totality of moves) lead to worker reunions, percentages that have not been reported and are well-above intuitive expectation. To assess the importance of worker reunions in determining job moves, we compare them to labor supply and demand with or without occupational specialization. The comparison shows that the most consistent information about job change is provided by reunions. We find that the greater the time workers spend together or the smaller the team they share both increase their likelihood to reunite, supporting the notion of increased familiarity and trust behind such reunions and the dominant role of social capital in the evolution of large organizations. Our study of this organization supports the idea that to correctly forecast job mobility inside large organizations, their teams structures and the social ties formed in those teams play a key role in shaping internal job change.</description>

      <title>The Dual Personas of Social Media Bots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media bots are AI agents that participate in online conversations. Most studies focus on the general bot and the malicious nature of these agents. However, bots have many different personas, each specialized towards a specific behavioral or content trait. Neither are bots singularly bad, because they are used for both good and bad information dissemination. In this article, we introduce fifteen agent personas of social media bots. These personas have two main categories: Content-Based Bot Persona and Behavior-Based Bot Persona. We also form yardsticks of the good-bad duality of the bots, elaborating on metrics of good and bad bot agents. Our work puts forth a guideline to inform bot detection regulation, emphasizing that policies should focus on how these agents are employed, rather than collectively terming bot agents as bad.</description>

      <title>Towards Designing Social Interventions For Online Climate Change Denialism Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As conspiracy theories gain traction, it has become crucial to research effective intervention strategies that can foster evidence and science-based discussions in conspiracy theory communities online. This study presents a novel framework using insider language to contest conspiracy theory ideology in climate change denialism on Reddit. Focusing on discussions in two Reddit communities, our research investigates reactions to pro-social and evidence-based intervention messages for two cohorts of users: climate change deniers and climate change supporters. Specifically, we combine manual and generative AI-based methods to craft intervention messages and deploy the interventions as replies on Reddit posts and comments through transparently labeled bot accounts. On the one hand, we find that evidence-based interventions with neutral language foster positive engagement, encouraging open discussions among believers of climate change denialism. On the other, climate change supporters respond positively, actively participating and presenting additional evidence. Our study contributes valuable insights into the process and challenges of automatically delivering interventions in conspiracy theory communities on social media, and helps inform future research on social media interventions.</description>

      <title>AI Feedback Enhances Community-Based Content Moderation through Engagement with Counterarguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, social media platforms are significant sources of news and political communication, but their role in spreading misinformation has raised significant concerns. In response, these platforms have implemented various content moderation strategies. One such method, Community Notes on X, relies on crowdsourced fact-checking and has gained traction, though it faces challenges such as partisan bias and delays in verification. This study explores an AI-assisted hybrid moderation framework in which participants receive AI-generated feedback -supportive, neutral, or argumentative -on their notes and are asked to revise them accordingly. The results show that incorporating feedback improves the quality of notes, with the most substantial gains resulting from argumentative feedback. This underscores the value of diverse perspectives and direct engagement in human-AI collective intelligence. The research contributes to ongoing discussions about AI's role in political content moderation, highlighting the potential of generative AI and the importance of informed design.</description>
