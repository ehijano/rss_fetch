      <title>Chimera state in neural network with the PID coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the emergence of collective behaviors within a network comprising interacting cells. Each cell integrates a fixed number of neurons governed by an activation gradient based on Hopfield's model. The intra-cell interactions among neurons are local and directed, while inter-cell connections are facilitated through a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) coupling mechanism. This coupling introduces an adaptable environmental variable, influencing the network dynamics significantly. Numerical simulations employing three neurons per cell across a network of fifty cells reveal diverse dynamics, including incoherence, coherence, synchronization, chimera states, and traveling wave. These phenomena are quantitatively assessed using statistical measures such as the order parameter, strength of incoherence, and discontinuity measure. Variations of the resistive, inductive, or capacitive couplings of the inter-cell environment are explored and their effects are analysed. Furthermore, the study identifies multistability in network dynamics, characterized by the coexistence of multiple stable states for the same set of parameters but with different initial conditions. A linear augmentation strategy is employed for its control.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in the non-reciprocal Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions in many-body systems lead to time-dependent states, commonly observed in biological, chemical, and ecological systems. The stability of these states in the thermodynamic limit, as well as the criticality of the phase transition from static to time-dependent states remains an open question. To tackle these questions, we study a minimalistic system endowed with non-reciprocal interactions: an Ising model with two spin species having opposing goals. The mean-field equation predicts three stable phases: disordered, ordered, and a time-dependent swap phase. Large scale numerical simulations support the following: (i) in 2D, the swap phase is destabilized by defects; (ii) in 3D, the swap phase is stable, and has the properties of a time-crystal; (iii) the transition from disorder to swap in 3D is characterized by the critical exponents of the 3D XY model, in agreement with the emerging continuous symmetry of time translation invariance; (iv) when the two species have fully anti-symmetric couplings, the static-order phase is unstable in any dimension due to droplet growth; (v) in the general case of asymmetric couplings, static order can be restored by a droplet-capture mechanism preventing the droplets from growing indefinitely. We provide details on the full phase diagram which includes first- and second-order-like phase transitions and study the coarsening dynamics of the swap as well as the static-order phases.</description>

      <title>Localized synchronous patterns in weakly coupled bistable oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by numerical continuation studies of coupled mechanical oscillators, we investigate branches of localized time-periodic solutions of one-dimensional chains of coupled oscillators. We focus on Ginzburg-Landau equations with nonlinearities of lambda-omega type and establish the existence of on-site and off-site solutions in the case of weak coupling and weak-amplitude dependence of the oscillator periods. Utilizing a core-far-field decomposition, we demonstrate that in-phase solutions lie on branches that exhibit snaking behavior.</description>

      <title>Relative Dynamics of Vortices in Confined Bose--Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the relative dynamics -- the dynamics modulo rotational symmetry in this particular context -- of $N$ vortices in confined Bose--Einstein Condensates (BEC) using a finite-dimensional vortex approximation to the two-dimensional Gross--Pitaevskii equation. We give a Hamiltonian formulation of the relative dynamics by showing that it is an instance of the Lie--Poisson equation on the dual of a certain Lie algebra. Just as in our accompanying work on vortex dynamics with the Euclidean symmetry, the relative dynamics possesses a Casimir invariant and evolves in an invariant set, yielding an Energy--Casimir-type stability condition. We consider three examples of relative equilibria -- those solutions that are undergoing rigid rotations about the origin -- with $N=2, 3, 4$, and investigate their stability using the stability condition.</description>

      <title>Navigating with Stability: Local Minima, Patterns, and Evolution in a Gradient Damage Fracture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In phase-field theories of brittle fracture, crack initiation, growth and path selection are investigated using non-convex energy functionals and a stability criterion. The lack of convexity with respect to the state poses difficulties to monolithic solvers that aim to solve for kinematic and internal variables, simultaneously. In this paper, we inquire into the effectiveness of quasi-Newton algorithms as an alternative to conventional Newton-Raphson solvers. These algorithms improve convergence by constructing a positive definite approximation of the Hessian, bargaining improved convergence with the risk of missing bifurcation points and stability thresholds. Our study focuses on one-dimensional phase-field fracture models of brittle thin films on elastic foundations. Within this framework, in the absence of irreversibility constraint, we construct an equilibrium map that represents all stable and unstable equilibrium states as a function of the external load, using well-known branch-following bifurcation techniques. Our main finding is that quasi-Newton algorithms fail to select stable evolution paths without exact second variation information. To solve this issue, we perform a spectral analysis of the full Hessian, providing optimal perturbations that enable quasi-Newton methods to follow a stable and potentially unique path for crack evolution. Finally, we discuss the stability issues and optimal perturbations in the case when the damage irreversibility is present, changing the topological structure of the set of admissible perturbations from a linear vector space to a convex cone.</description>
