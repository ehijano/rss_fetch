      <title>Boosting Binomial Exotic Option Pricing with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pricing of exotic financial derivatives, such as Asian and multi-asset American basket options, poses significant challenges for standard numerical methods such as binomial trees or Monte Carlo methods. While the former often scales exponentially with the parameters of interest, the latter often requires expensive simulations to obtain sufficient statistical convergence. This work combines the binomial pricing method for options with tensor network techniques, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS), to overcome these challenges. Our proposed methods scale linearly with the parameters of interest and significantly reduce the computational complexity of pricing exotics compared to conventional methods. For Asian options, we present two methods: a tensor train cross approximation-based method for pricing, and a variational pricing method using MPS, which provides a stringent lower bound on option prices. For multi-asset American basket options, we combine the decoupled trees technique with the tensor train cross approximation to efficiently handle baskets of up to $m = 8$ correlated assets. All approaches scale linearly in the number of discretization steps $N$ for Asian options, and the number of assets $m$ for multi-asset options. Our numerical experiments underscore the high potential of tensor network methods as highly efficient simulation and optimization tools for financial engineering.</description>

      <title>Words That Unite The World: A Unified Framework for Deciphering Central Bank Communications Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central banks around the world play a crucial role in maintaining economic stability. Deciphering policy implications in their communications is essential, especially as misinterpretations can disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. To address this, we introduce the World Central Banks (WCB) dataset, the most comprehensive monetary policy corpus to date, comprising over 380k sentences from 25 central banks across diverse geographic regions, spanning 28 years of historical data. After uniformly sampling 1k sentences per bank (25k total) across all available years, we annotate and review each sentence using dual annotators, disagreement resolutions, and secondary expert reviews. We define three tasks: Stance Detection, Temporal Classification, and Uncertainty Estimation, with each sentence annotated for all three. We benchmark seven Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and nine Large Language Models (LLMs) (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and with annotation guide) on these tasks, running 15,075 benchmarking experiments. We find that a model trained on aggregated data across banks significantly surpasses a model trained on an individual bank's data, confirming the principle "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." Additionally, rigorous human evaluations, error analyses, and predictive tasks validate our framework's economic utility.

      <title>Stochastic Price Dynamics in Response to Order Flow Imbalance: Evidence from CSI 300 Index Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct modeling of the price dynamics following order flow imbalance in market microstructure and apply the model to the analysis of Chinese CSI 300 Index Futures. There are three findings. The first is that the order flow imbalance is analogous to a shock to the market. Unlike the common practice of using Hawkes processes, we model the impact of order flow imbalance as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with memory and mean-reverting characteristics driven by a jump-type L\'evy process. Motivated by the empirically stable correlation between order flow imbalance and contemporaneous price changes, we propose a modified asset price model where the drift term of canonical geometric Brownian motion is replaced by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We establish stochastic differential equations and derive the logarithmic return process along with its mean and variance processes under initial boundary conditions, and evolution of cost-effectiveness ratio with order flow imbalance as the trading trigger point, termed as the quasi-Sharpe ratio or response ratio. Secondly, our results demonstrate horizon-dependent heterogeneity in how conventional metrics interact with order flow imbalance. This underscores the critical role of forecast horizon selection for strategies. Thirdly, we identify regime-dependent dynamics in the memory and forecasting power of order flow imbalance. This taxonomy provides both a screening protocol for existing indicators and an ex-ante evaluation paradigm for novel metrics.</description>

      <title>Tackling Decision Processes with Non-Cumulative Objectives using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to model a wide variety of applications ranging from game playing over robotics to finance. Their optimal policy typically maximizes the expected sum of rewards given at each step of the decision process. However, a large class of problems does not fit straightforwardly into this framework: Non-cumulative Markov decision processes (NCMDPs), where instead of the expected sum of rewards, the expected value of an arbitrary function of the rewards is maximized. Example functions include the maximum of the rewards or their mean divided by their standard deviation. In this work, we introduce a general mapping of NCMDPs to standard MDPs. This allows all techniques developed to find optimal policies for MDPs, such as reinforcement learning or dynamic programming, to be directly applied to the larger class of NCMDPs. Focusing on reinforcement learning, we show applications in a diverse set of tasks, including classical control, portfolio optimization in finance, and discrete optimization problems. Given our approach, we can improve both final performance and training time compared to relying on standard MDPs.</description>
