      <title>Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Degenerate Einstein Model of Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our Recent advancements in stochastic processes have illuminated a paradox associated with the Einstein model of Brownian motion. The model predicts an infinite propagation speed, conflicting with the second law of thermodynamics. The modified model successfully resolves the issue, establishing a finite propagation speed by introducing a concentration-dependent diffusion matrix. In this paper, we outline the necessary conditions for this property through a counter-example. The second part of the paper focuses on the stability analysis of the solution of the degenerate Einstein model. We introduce a functional dependence on the solution that satisfies a specific ordinary differential inequality. Our investigation explores the solution's dependence on the boundary and initial data of the original problem, demonstrating asymptotic stability under various conditions. These results have practical applications in understanding stochastic processes within bounded domains.</description>
