      <title>On-liquid-gallium surface synthesis of ultra-smooth conductive metal-organic framework thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging electroactive materials for (opto-)electronics. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve reliable MOF-based devices via the existing synthesis methods that are compatible with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, as the surface roughness of thus-far synthetic MOF films or pellets is rather high for efficient electrode contact. Here, we develop an on-liquid-gallium surface synthesis (OLGSS) strategy under chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions for the controlled growth of two-dimensional conjugated MOF (2D c-MOF) thin films with ten-fold improvement of surface flatness (surface roughness can reach as low as ~2 {\AA}) compared with MOF films grown by the traditional methods. Supported by theoretical modeling, we unveil a layer-by-layer CVD growth mode for constructing flattening surfaces, that is triggered by the high adhesion energy between gallium (Ga) and planar aromatic ligands. We further demonstrate the generality of the as-proposed OLGSS strategy by reproducing such a flat surface over nine different 2D c-MOF films with variable thicknesses (~2 to 208 nm) and large lateral sizes (over 1 cm2). The resultant ultra-smooth 2D c-MOF films enable the formation of high-quality electrical contacts with gold (Au) electrodes, leading to a reduction of contact resistance by over ten orders of magnitude compared to the traditional uneven MOF films. Furthermore, due to the efficient interfacial interaction benifited from the high-quality contacts, the prepared van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) of OLGSS c-MOF and MoS2 exhibits intriguing photoluminescence (PL) enhancement, PL peak shift and large work function modulation. The establishment of the reliable OLGSS method provides the chances to push the development of MOF electronics and the construction of multicomponent MOF-based heterostructure materials.</description>

      <title>Interdot Lead Halide Excess Management in PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-harvesting devices made from PbS quantum dot (QD) absorbers are one of the many promising technologies of third-generation photovoltaics. Their simple, solution-based fabrication together with a highly tunable and broad light absorption makes their application in newly developed solar cells particularly promising. In order to yield devices with reduced voltage and current losses, PbS QDs need to have strategically passivated surfaces, most commonly achieved through lead iodide and bromide passivation. The interdot spacing is then predominantly filled with residual amorphous lead halide species that remain from the ligand exchange, thus hindering efficient charge transport and reducing device stability. Herein, we demonstrate that a post-treatment by iodide based 2-phenylethlyammonium salts (X-PEAI) and intermediate 2D perovskite formation can be used to manage the lead halide excess in the PbS QD active layer. This treatment results in improved device performance and increased shelf-life stability, demonstrating the importance of interdot spacing management in PbS quantum dot photovoltaics.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of top SiO2 interlayer thickness on memory window of Si channel FeFET with TiN/SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx/Si (MIFIS) gate structure. The memory window increases with thicker top SiO2. We realize the memory window of 6.3 V for 3.4 nm top SiO2. Moreover, we find that the endurance characteristic degrades with increasing the initial memory window.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1710.07634v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newton-Raphson (N-R) method is useful to find the roots of a polynomial of degree n. However, this method is limited since it diverges for the case in which polynomials only have complex roots if a real initial condition is taken. In the present work, we explain an iterative method that is created using the fractional calculus, which we will call the Fractional Newton-Raphson (F N-R) Method, which has the ability to enter the space of complex numbers given a real initial condition, which allows us to find both the real and complex roots of a polynomial unlike the classical Newton-Raphson method.</description>

      <title>Fractional Newton-Raphson Method and Some Variants for the Solution of Non-linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.01453v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following document presents some novel numerical methods valid for one and several variables, which using the fractional derivative, allow to find solutions for some non-linear systems in the complex space using real initial conditions. The origin of these methods is the fractional Newton-Raphson method but unlike the latter, the orders of fractional derivatives proposed here are functions. In the first method, a function is used to guarantee an order of convergence (at least) quadratic, and in the others, a function is used to avoid the discontinuity that is generated when the fractional derivative of the constants is used, and with this, it is possible that the methods have at most an order of convergence (at least) linear.</description>

      <title>Fractional pseudo-Newton method and its use in the solution of a nonlinear system that allows the construction of a hybrid solar receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.10860v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following document presents a possible solution and a brief stability analysis for a nonlinear system, which is obtained by studying the possibility of building a hybrid solar receiver; It is necessary to mention that the solution of the aforementioned system is relatively difficult to obtain through iterative methods since the system is apparently unstable. To find this possible solution is used a novel numerical method valid for one and several variables, which using the fractional derivative, allows us to find solutions for some nonlinear systems in the complex space using real initial conditions, this method is also valid for linear systems. The method described above has an order of convergence (at least) linear, but it is easy to implement and it is not necessary to invert some matrix for solving nonlinear systems and linear systems.</description>

      <title>An approximation to zeros of the Riemann zeta function using fractional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.14963v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this document, as far as the authors know, an approximation to the zeros of the Riemann zeta function has been obtained for the first time using only derivatives of constant functions, which was possible only because a fractional iterative method was used. This iterative method, valid for one and several variables, uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find multiple zeros of a function using a single initial condition. This partly solves the intrinsic problem of iterative methods that if we want to find N zeros it is necessary to give N initial conditions. Consequently, the method is suitable for approximating nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function when the absolute value of its imaginary part tends to infinity. The deduction of the iterative method is presented, some examples of its implementation, and finally 53 different values near to the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are shown.</description>

      <title>Aviation sector decarbonization within the hydrogen economy A UAE case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UAE aviation sector is vital for its economy and is forecast to grow substantially in the coming decades, increasing thereby fuel consumption. At the same time, the country is committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change. Liquid green hydrogen is expected to emerge as an important aviation fuel in the future. The UAE can use its vast solar energy resources to produce cost-competitive hydrogen at scale, securing so its aviation fuel supply. This development, however, needs several decades to materialize. The PV farms needed to produce the electricity for water electrolysis need yet to be constructed. The infrastructure to produce, liquify, store and transport hydrogen is yet to unfold. Hydrogen-powered aircrafts need to yet evolve from the current small scale demonstration projects to long-haul commercial airplanes. It is realistically by 2050 when hydrogen gains momentum and by 2070 when it becomes the primary aviation fuel. This paper details why and how liquid green hydrogen will find its gap as aviation fuel in the UAE and provides the strategy and policy recommendations to facilitate this development.</description>

      <title>Environmental permittivity-asymmetric BIC metasurfaces with electrical reconfigurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of nanophotonics, achieving precise spectral and temporal light manipulation at the nanoscale remains a critical challenge. While photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a powerful means of controlling light, their common reliance on geometrical symmetry breaking for obtaining tailored resonances makes them highly susceptible to fabrication imperfections and fundamentally limits their maximum resonance quality factor. Here, we introduce the concept of environmental symmetry breaking by embedding identical resonators into a surrounding medium with carefully placed regions of contrasting refractive indexes, activating permittivity-driven quasi-BIC resonances without any alterations of the underlying resonator geometry and unlocking an additional degree of freedom for light manipulation through actively tuning the surrounding refractive index contrast. We demonstrate this concept by integrating polyaniline (PANI), an electro-optically active polymer, to achieve electrically reconfigurable qBICs. This integration not only demonstrates rapid switching speeds, and exceptional durability but also significantly boosts the system's optical response to environmental perturbations. Our strategy significantly expands the capabilities of resonant light manipulation through permittivity modulation, opening avenues for on-chip optical devices, advanced sensing, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Training all-mechanical neural networks for task learning through in situ backpropagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances unveiled physical neural networks as promising machine learning platforms, offering faster and more energy-efficient information processing. Compared with extensively-studied optical neural networks, the development of mechanical neural networks (MNNs) remains nascent and faces significant challenges, including heavy computational demands and learning with approximate gradients. Here, we introduce the mechanical analogue of in situ backpropagation to enable highly efficient training of MNNs. We demonstrate that the exact gradient can be obtained locally in MNNs, enabling learning through their immediate vicinity. With the gradient information, we showcase the successful training of MNNs for behavior learning and machine learning tasks, achieving high accuracy in regression and classification. Furthermore, we present the retrainability of MNNs involving task-switching and damage, demonstrating the resilience. Our findings, which integrate the theory for training MNNs and experimental and numerical validations, pave the way for mechanical machine learning hardware and autonomous self-learning material systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing frustration in real-world signed networks: traditional or relaxed balance?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to traditional balance theory, individual social actors avoid establishing triads with an odd number of negative links. Generalising, mesoscopic balance is realised when the nodes of a signed graph can be grouped into positively connected subsets, mutually connected by negative links. If this prescription is interpreted rigidly without allowing for statistical noise, it quickly dismisses most real graphs as frustrated. As an alternative, a relaxed, yet qualitative, definition of balance has been advanced. After rephrasing both variants in statistically testable terms, we propose an inference scheme to unambiguously assess if a signed graph is traditionally or relaxedly balanced.</description>

      <title>Broad Angle Resolver for THz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication systems hold immense potential for high-speed data transfer across various domains yet face challenges due to directionality constraints because of free space path loss. To address this, directional beams are commonly employed in THz technology. With the usage directional beams, it is important to track the transmitting device to keep the link connectivity. Leaky Parallel Plate Waveguides (LPPWs) were introduced to tackle this challenge. But traditional LPPW uses unique angle-frequency relationship which requires broad range of frequencies. This study proposes a novel approach to mitigate these constraints, balancing directionality with reduced directional gain to enhance LPPW adaptability. The proposed device can accurately determine the receiving angle of a beam by analyzing unique features extracted from the dual peak outputs. Experimentation and simulations reveal that the device allows for a broader angle of acceptance and calculation of the received angle.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Topological In-Bulk Corner State in Pure Diffusion Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared with conventional topological insulator that carries topological state at its boundaries, the higher-order topological insulator exhibits lower-dimensional gapless boundary states at its corners and hinges. Leveraging the form similarity between Schrodinger equation and diffusion equation, researches on higher-order topological insulators have been extended from condensed matter physics to thermal diffusion. Unfortunately, all the corner states of thermal higher-order topological insulator reside within the band gap. Another kind of corner state, which is embedded in the bulk states, has not been realized in pure diffusion systems so far. Here, we construct higher-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models based on sphere-rod structure to elucidate these corner states, which we term ``in-bulk corner states". Due to the anti-Hermitian properties of diffusive Hamiltonian, we investigate the thermal behaviour of these corner states through theoretical calculation, simulation, and experiment. Furthermore, we study the different thermal behaviours of in-bulk corner state and in-gap corner state. Our results would open a different gate for diffusive topological states and provide a distinct application for efficient heat dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, remains one of the foremost public health challenges of our time. Despite decades of research, its etiology largely remains enigmatic. Recently, attention has turned to the gut-brain axis, a complex network of communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain, as a potential player in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we exploited X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography to provide an in-depth analysis of the link between the gut condition and AD, exploring gut anatomy and structure in murine models. We conducted a comprehensive analysis by comparing the outcomes in various mouse models of cognitive impairment, including AD, frail mice, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) affected mice. We discovered an association between substantial changes in the gut structure and the presence of amyloid-beta (A\b{eta}) in the brain. We found that the most important gut alterations are related to A\b{eta} occurrence in the brain. In particular, we investigated the gut morphology, the distribution of enteric micro-processes and neurons in the ileum. Understanding the intricate interplay between gut condition and dementia may open new avenues for early AD diagnosis and treatment offering hope for a future where these diseases may be more effectively addressed.</description>

      <title>Engineering synthetic gauge fields through the coupling phases in cavity magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics, which studies the interaction of light with magnetic systems in a cavity, is a promising platform for quantum transducers and quantum memories. At microwave frequencies, the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasi-particle of a spin wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each photon/magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, but is often neglected in simple systems. However, in "loop-coupled" systems, where there are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres made of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement between theory and the experimental data. These results show that in cavity magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for cavity-mediated coupling and engineering dark mode physics.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer between shifted graphene gratings</title>

Abstract: We examine the near-field radiative heat transfer between finite-thickness planar fused silica slabs covered with graphene gratings, through the utilization of the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions (FMM-LBF), with focus on the lateral shift effect. To do so, we propose and validate a minor modification of the FMM-LBF theory to account for the lateral shift. This approach goes far beyond the effective medium approximation because this latter cannot account for the lateral shift. We show that the heat flux can exhibit significant oscillations with the lateral shift and, at short separation, it can experience up to a 60%-70% reduction compared to the aligned case. Such a lateral shift effect is found to be sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ (separation distance to grating period ratio). When $d/D&gt;1$ (realized through large separation or small grating period), the two graphene gratings see each other as an effective whole rather than in detail, and thus the lateral shift effect on heat transfer becomes less important. Therefore, we can clearly distinguish two asymptotic regimes for radiative heat transfer: the LSE (Lateral Shift Effect) regime, where a significant lateral shift effect is observed, and the non-LSE regime, where this effect is negligible. Furthermore, regardless of the lateral shift, the radiative heat flux shows a non-monotonic dependence on the graphene chemical potential. That is, we can get an optimal radiative heat flux (peaking at about 0.3eV chemical potential) by $\textit{in situ}$ modulating the chemical potential. This work has the potential to unveil new avenues for harnessing the lateral shift effect on radiative heat transfer in graphene-based nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electron Extraction in Co-Doped TiO2 Quantified by Drift-Diffusion Simulation for Stable CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar cells based on inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 are promising candidates to resolve the challenge of operational stability in the field of perovskite photovoltaics. For stable operation, however, it is crucial to thoroughly understand the extractive and recombinative processes occurring at the interfaces of perovskite and the charge-selective layers. In this study, we focus on the electronic properties of (doped) TiO2 as an electron-selective contact. We show via KPFM that co-doping of TiO2 with Nb(V) and Sn(IV) reduces the materials work function by 270 meV, giving it stronger n-type characteristics compared to Nb(V) mono-doped TiO2. The altered electronic alignment with CsPbI3 translates to enhanced electron extraction, as demonstrated with ssPL, trPL and trSPV in triad. Importantly, we extract crucial parameters, such as the concentration of extracted electrons and the interface hole recombination velocity, from the SPV transients via 2D drift-diffusion simulations. When implementing the co-doped TiO2 into full n-i-p solar cells, the operational stability is enhanced to 32000 h of projected TS80 lifetime. This study provides fundamental understanding of interfacial charge extraction and its correlation with operational stability of perovskite solar cells, which can be transferred to other charge-selective contacts.</description>
