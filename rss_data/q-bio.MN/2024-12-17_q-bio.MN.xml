      <title>A theoretical investigation provides an integrated understanding of the complex regulatory network controlling Arabidopsis root hair patterning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex regulatory network controlling Arabidopsis root hair patterning has been defined using data collected over decades. The network, embedded in the root epidermis, contains positive and negative feedback loops, cell-cell signalling within the epidermal tissue, and receives positional signalling from underlying tissue. While there are extensive data regarding individual components and their interactions within the network, the sufficiency of the regulatory network to produce robust epidermal patterning is not clear, nor is it clear how individual components and interactions work together to ensure correct epidermal patterning. Mathematical modelling was used to address the questions of sufficiency, and to gain an integrated understanding of collective behaviour emerging from individual components and interactions within the regulatory network. Theoretical experiments were performed on a model of the root hair patterning regulatory network. It was found that our current understanding of the epidermal patterning network was insufficient to reproduce experimental data. The model was used to hypothesise the existence of an additional negative feedback loop which, when added to the currently understood regulatory network, enabled the model to reproduce wild type and mutant root hair patterning. Results of theoretical experiments on the modified regulatory network were used to; define an essential relationship between diffusive movement of two cell-cell signalling proteins; show that directed movement dysregulation of another cell-cell signalling protein causes root hair patterning to appear as though it no longer receives positional cues; and show that cooperativity or oligomerisation within the regulatory network's positive feedback loop are essential. This work presents an integrated, exploration of the regulatory network controlling epidermal root hair patterning in Arabidopsis.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Control of State Transitions in Dense Associative Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a generalization of Modern Hopfield networks that emerges naturally in the gene regulatory networks that control cellular identity. Here gene expression patterns correspond to stored memories and the dynamics are governed by the interplay between an inverse-temperature-like parameter $\beta$ and a weight vector $\textbf{w}$. The parameter $\beta$ controls the attractor landscape structure: at large $\beta$, memory patterns are stable attractors, while at lower $\beta$ values, the attractors are associated with progenitor patterns: weighted combinations of two or more memory patterns. We associate progenitor states with self similarity of the model following a coarse graining transformation on memory pattern subsets. We use this transformation to propose a hierarchical model for the control of the identity, stability, and basins of attraction of the progenitor states which facilitates transitions between memory patterns through an annealing-like mechanism. We use this framework to explain the dynamical regulation of blood formation in mammals, demonstrating how robust control of attractor transitions may emerge in complex feedback networks and providing a mathematical basis for well established experimental observations on the hierarchical control of cell identity.</description>
