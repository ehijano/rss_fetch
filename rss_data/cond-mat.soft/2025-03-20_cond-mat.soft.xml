      <title>Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</description>

      <title>On the planar impact of a disc and a square particle considering the impact angle and particle orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the simple impact of a rigid particle being a centuries old problem, a conclusive treatment of the general case is still outstanding. The influences of particle shape as well as elastic and plastic deformation of the particle upon contact significantly complicate the problem. Experiments have shown the possibilities of backward movement as well as forward movement with backward rotation after an impact. This paper investigates the planar impact of a disc and square particle under systematic consideration of the impact angle and initial particle orientation. We investigate the kinematic variables of the particle both post-impact as well as their evolution during contact. For impacts with friction, we find oscillatory behaviour of the tangential contact force in both discs and squares depending on the impact angle and particle orientation. We further demonstrate the possibility of backwards deflection for square particles with backward orientation under steep impact angles, which is not possible for round particles under the same conditions. In contrast, high deflection angles are achieved with a kind of "double-impact" where the centroid of the particle moves away from the plane so that the surface detaches first, but reconnects again due to induced rotation, which also is not possible for round particles. Lastly, we present different coefficients of restitution for the square particle with respect to the combined influence of impact angle and particle orientation upon impact.</description>

      <title>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content widely utilized in biomedical applications. Injectable depot-forming hydrogels for drug delivery offer sustained release of biomolecular cargo, leveraging controlled macromolecular diffusion within dynamic networks to promote extended immunity and favorable immunological responses. However, mitigating burst release while maintaining sustained-release properties remains a challenge due to network disruption during needle extrusion, leading to excessive short-term cargo release and local toxicity. While controlling both short- and long-term release profiles would mitigate this issue, it remains a persistent challenge. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy for self-regulating, post-injection network evolution enabled by exchange of functional molecules with physiological environment, achieving controlled cargo release over both short and long durations. By tuning network viscoelasticity, we optimized rheological properties to minimize burst release while preserving sustained-release profiles. Using model protein cargo, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated reduced burst release and comparable sustained-release to unmodified control formulations. These findings highlight a novel strategy for precise cargo delivery in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Active wetting transitions induced by rotational noise at solid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.</description>

      <title>Costs and benefits of phytoplankton motility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather all available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</description>

      <title>Intumescent Polymer-Particle Hydrogels Expand the Retardancy Window for Wildfire Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2025 Los Angeles wildfires caused widespread urban destruction and displacement, and severe economic losses, highlighting the urgent need for better fire retardants. Current fire suppression strategies rely heavily on water, chemical fire retardants, and water-enhancing gels, which use superabsorbent polymers to retain water and adhere to substrates, offering extended fire protection compared to water alone. However, their effectiveness is limited by evaporation and degradation under extreme heat and wind conditions. This study investigates the thermal properties, evaporation dynamics, and fire retardancy mechanisms of a novel polymer-particle (PP) hydrogel with aerogel-forming capabilities. Using a combination of retardancy tests, thermal analysis and modeling, rheological characterization, porosity analysis, and electron microscopy, we analyze how the gelation mechanism, polymer network integrity, and physical interactions of cellulose chains with colloidal silica particles influence fire retardancy and intumescent response. The boiling-induced water vapor expansion and bubble nucleation drive the transformation of the hydrogel into a highly porous, large-volume fire-retardant dome upon rapid heat desiccation, enhancing thermal insulation. By evaluating the retardancy window across different evaporation stages under high heat and wind conditions, this study aims to determine the duration, effectiveness, and governing physical mechanisms of this unique retardant system. These findings provide a framework for designing the next generation of fire retardants with optimized thermal stability and extended protection for wildfire mitigation.</description>

      <title>Charging dynamics of electric double layer capacitors including beyond-mean-field electrostatic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Shape Symmetry Breaking in Surfactant Mediated Crystal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamical model of crystal growth, in which it is possible to reliably achieve asymmetric products, beginning from symmetric initial conditions and growing within an isotropic environment. The asymmetric growth is the result of a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the effect of thermal fluctuations in the coverage of surfactants on the growing crystalline facets. Within our simple model, we are able to understand the kinetic and thermodynamic factors involved in both the onset of symmetry breaking and the persistence of anisotropic growth. We demonstrate that the mechanism is general by studying models with increasing complexity. We argue that this mechanism of symmetry breaking underpins observations of colloidal, seed-mediated syntheses of single crystalline metal nanorods capped with strongly interacting surfactants. The parameters within our model are related to experimental observables such as the concentration, hydrophobicity, and binding strength of the surfactants, which suggests a potential route to optimize the yield of asymmetric products in colloidal nanoparticle syntheses.</description>

      <title>Modeling and computation of the effective elastic behavior of parallelogram origami metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Foundation of classical dynamical density functional theory: uniqueness of time-dependent density-potential mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When can we map a classical density profile to an external potential? In equilibrium, without time dependence, the one-body density is known to specify the external potential that is applied to the many-body system. This mapping from a density to the potential is the cornerstone of classical density functional theory (DFT). Here, we consider non-equilibrium, time-dependent many-body systems that evolve from a given initial condition. We derive explicit conditions, for example, no flux at the boundary, that ensure that the mapping from the density to a time-dependent external potential is unique. We thus prove the underlying assertion of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT), without resorting to the so-called adiabatic approximation often used in applications. By ascertaining uniqueness for all $n$-body densities, we ensure that the proof and the physical conclusions drawn from it hold for general superadiabatic dynamics of interacting systems even in the presence of (known) non-conservative forces.</description>
