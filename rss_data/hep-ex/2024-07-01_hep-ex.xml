      <title>The Belle II Detector Upgrades Framework Conceptual Design Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the planned near-term and potential longer-term upgrades of the Belle II detector at the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider operating at the KEK laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan. These upgrades will allow increasingly sensitive searches for possible new physics beyond the Standard Model in flavor, tau, electroweak and dark sector physics that are both complementary to and competitive with the LHC and other experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurement of differential cross-sections in $t\bar t$ and $t\bar t+$jets production in the lepton+jets final state in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt s=13$ TeV using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of ATLAS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential cross-sections for top-quark pair production, inclusively and in association with jets, are measured in $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. The events are selected with one charged lepton (electron or muon) and at least four jets. The differential cross-sections are presented at particle level as functions of several jet observables, including angular correlations, jet transverse momenta and invariant masses of the jets in the final state, which characterise the kinematics and dynamics of the top-antitop system and the hard QCD radiation in the system with associated jets. The typical precision is 5%-15% for the absolute differential cross-sections and 2%-4% for the normalised differential cross-sections. Next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD predictions are found to provide an adequate description of the rate and shape of the jet-angular observables. The description of the transverse momentum and invariant mass observables is improved when next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD corrections are included.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Thermal Management Strategies for the Silicon Detectors of CBM at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight thermal management is central to the design of the all-silicon Inner Tracker of the Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). This experiment aims to study strongly interacting matter at neutron star core densities through fixed-target Au-Au collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.9 - 4.9\,$GeV; up to 10$^7$ beam-target interactions per second; polar angular acceptance of $2.5^{\circ} \leq \Theta \leq 25^{\circ}$). Studies with thermal demonstrators for both the pixel-based Micro Vertex Detector and the strip-based Silicon Tracking System have validated their thermal management strategies, preparing them for series production now and global commissioning in 2028.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy quarkonium production in heavy ion ultraperipheral collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusive production of pseudoscalar heavy quarkoniua ($\eta_c,~\eta_b$ and $B_c$) via photon-photon fusion in heavy ion ultraperipheral collision (UPC) are calculated to QCD next-to-leading order in the framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). The total cross section of $\eta_c$ produced in Pb-Pb UPC is 194 $\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ and 1052 $\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ at nucleon-nucleon c.m. energies $\sqrt{S_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 5.52 TeV and 39.4 TeV, respectively. The cross sections for $\eta_b$ and $B_c$ mesons are more than two to three orders of magnitude smaller. We make a detailed phenomenological analysis on the $\eta_c$ production; the uncertainties caused by the renormalization scale and the charm quark mass, the cross sections in other ultraperipheral nucleon-nucleon colliding systems, and the transverse momentum distribution are discussed. At the coming HL-LHC and future FCC, the heavy ion UPC opens another door of the study on the production of heavy quarkonium.</description>

      <title>First results on monolithic CMOS detector with internal gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we report on a set of characterisations carried out on the first monolithic LGAD prototype integrated in a customised 110 nm CMOS process having a depleted active volume thickness of 48 $\mu$m. This prototype is formed by a pixel array where each pixel has a total size of 100 $\mu$m $\times$ 250 $\mu$m and includes a high-speed front-end amplifier. After describing the sensor and the electronics architecture, both laboratory and in-beam measurements are reported and described. Optical characterisations performed with an IR pulsed laser setup have shown a sensor internal gain of about 2.5. With the same experimental setup, the electronic jitter was found to be between 50 ps and 150 ps, depending on the signal amplitude. Moreover, the analysis of a test beam performed at the Proton Synchrotron (PS) T10 facility of CERN with 10 GeV/c protons and pions indicated that the overall detector time resolution is in the range of 234 ps to 244 ps. Further TCAD investigations, based on the doping profile extracted from $C(V)$ measurements, confirmed the multiplication gain measured on the test devices. Finally, TCAD simulations were used to tune the future doping concentration of the gain layer implant, targeting sensors with a higher avalanche gain. This adjustment is expected to enhance the timing performance of the sensors of the future productions, in order to cope with the high event rate expected in most of the near future high-energy and high-luminosity physics experiments, where the time resolution will be essential to disentangle overlapping events and it will also be crucial for Particle IDentification (PID).</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD corrections to nucleon Dirac form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading-order perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to nucleon electromagnetic form factors were first made in late 70s. Nearly half a century later, we accomplish the calculation of the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to proton and neutron's Dirac form factors at large momentum transfer, to the leading-twist accuracy in collinear factorization. The effect of NLO perturbative corrections turns out to be positive and substantial. Confronting our state-of-the-art pQCD predictions with the available data for nucleon Dirac form factors, in both space-like and time-like regions, imposes a stringent test on the validity of the parameterized forms of nucleon leading-twist light-cone-distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), which have been predicted by a class of QCD sum rules-based models and lattice QCD simulation.</description>

      <title>Correlating $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays and flavor observables in leptoquark models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate minimal scalar leptoquark models that dynamically generate neutrino Majorana masses at the one-loop level and examine their implications for low-energy processes. We show that these models can produce viable neutrino masses, consistent with neutrino oscillation and cosmological data. By using leptoquark couplings fixed by neutrino data, we predict additional contributions to neutrinoless double-beta decays ($0\nu\beta\beta$), which are chirality enhanced and compete with the standard contributions from the Majorana masses. Our analysis demonstrates that these effects are sizable for leptoquark masses as large as $\mathcal{O}(300~\mathrm{TeV})$, potentially increasing or decreasing the $0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life, and creating an ambiguity between the normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between $0\nu\beta\beta$ and flavor observables, such as kaon decays and $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, emphasizing that the latter is complementary to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

      <title>Tau Tridents at Accelerator Neutrino Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first detailed study of Standard Model (SM) neutrino tridents involving tau leptons at the near detectors of accelerator neutrino facilities. These processes were previously thought to be negligible, even at future facilities like DUNE, based on approximations that underestimated the tau trident cross sections. Our full $2\to 4$ calculation, including both coherent and incoherent scatterings, reveals that the DUNE near detector will actually get a non-negligible number of tau tridents, which is an important background to new physics searches. We identify promising kinematic features that may allow distinction of tau tridents from the usual neutrino charged-current background at DUNE, and thus could establish the observation of tau tridents for the first time. We also comment on the detection prospects at other accelerator and collider neutrino experiments.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic ray muons prove valuable across various fields, from particle physics experiments to non-invasive tomography, thanks to their high flux and exceptional penetrating capability. Utilizing a scintillator detector, one can effectively study the topography of mountains situated above tunnels and underground spaces. The Hankuk Atmospheric-muon Wide Landscaping (HAWL) project successfully charts the mountainous region of eastern Korea by measuring cosmic ray muons with a detector in motion. The real-time muon flux measurement shows a tunnel length accuracy of 6.0 %, with a detectable overburden range spanning from 8 to 400 meter-water-equivalent depth. This is the first real-time portable muon tomography.</description>

      <title>Illuminating all-hadronic final states with a photon: Exotic decays of the Higgs boson to four bottom quarks in vector boson fusion plus gamma at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential to detect Higgs boson decays to four bottom quarks through a pair of pseudoscalars, a final state that is predicted by many theories beyond the Standard Model. For the first time, the signal sensitivity is evaluated for the final state using the vector boson fusion (VBF) production with and without an associated photon, for the Higgs at $m_H=125\,\textrm{GeV}$, at hadron colliders. The signal significance is $4$ to $6\sigma$, depending on the pseudoscalar mass $m_a$, when setting the the Higgs decay branching ratio to unity, using an integrated luminosity of $150\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13\,\textrm{TeV}$. This corresponds to an upper limit of $0.3$, on the Higgs branching ratio to four bottom quarks, with a non-observation of the decay. We also consider several variations of selection requirements - input variables for the VBF tagging and the kinematic variables for the photon - that could help guide the design of new triggers for the Run-3 period of the LHC and for the HL-LHC.</description>

Abstract: We propose Generalized No-Scale Supergravity, the simplest scenario for Effective Super-Natural Supersymmetry, naturally solving the supersymmetry electroweak fine-tuning problem and including natural dark matter. A light right-handed slepton bulk region is realized in $\mathcal{F}$-$SU(5)$ and the pMSSM. The bulk may be beyond the LHC reach, though can be probed at the 1000-day LUX-ZEPLIN, Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) at CERN, Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), and Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Constraining kaon PDFs from Drell-Yan and $J/\psi$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs) are poorly known due to paucity of kaon-induced Drell-Yan data. Nevertheless, these Drell-Yan data suggest a softer valence $u$ quark distribution of kaon than that of pion. We discuss the opportunity to constrain kaon PDFs utilizing existing kaon-induced $J/\psi$ production data. We compare the $K^- / \pi^-$ and $K^+ / \pi^+$ cross-section ratio data with calculations based on two global-fit parametrizations and two recent theoretical predictions for the kaon and pion PDFs, and test the results with two quarkonium production models. The $K^- / \pi^-$ cross-section ratio for $J/\psi$ production provides independent evidence of different valence quark distributions in pion and kaon. The $K^+ / \pi^+$ $J/\psi$ data are found to be sensitive to the gluon distribution in kaon. We show that these $J/\psi$ production data provide valuable constraints for evaluating the adequacy of currently available sets of kaon PDFs.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the masses of heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ in the framework of the QCD sum rules. Considering the double-gluon hybrid meson operators in the octet-octet color structure, we have constructed two independent interpolating currents with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and five independent currents with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$. For the interpolating currents with antisymmetric glueball operator, there exist non-local divergences in one kind of additional Feynman diagrams of the tri-gluon condensate, which will give important contributions to the sum rule stabilities and mass predictions. We use the diagrammatic renormalization to cancel out such divergences. At the leading order of $\alpha_s$, the two-point correlation functions and spectral densities can be expressed in the analytic form of the generalized hypergeometric functions and Meijer's G-functions. After performing the numerical analysis, we predict the masses of the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ charmonium double-gluon hybrid mesons to be around $6.1-7.2$ GeV and $6.3-6.4$ GeV, respectively. For the bottomonium systems, their masses are predicted to be $13.7-14.3$ GeV and $12.6-13.3$ GeV for the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ channels, respectively. Besides, it is possible to hunt for these charmonium hybrids in the radiative decays of bottomonium mesons in BelleII experiment. Further investigations on these hybrid states in various theoretical and phenomenological methods are also anticipated in the future.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of NaI(Tl) crystal encapsulation for the NEON experiment</title>

Abstract: The Neutrino Elastic-scattering Observation with NaI(Tl) experiment (NEON) aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering~(\cenns) in a NaI(Tl) crystal using reactor anti-electron neutrinos at the Hanbit nuclear power plant complex. A total of 13.3 kg of NaI(Tl) crystals were initially installed in December 2020 at the tendon gallery, 23.7$\pm$0.3\,m away from the reactor core, which operates at a thermal power of 2.8\,GW. Initial engineering operation was performed from May 2021 to March 2022 and observed unexpected photomultiplier-induced noise and a decreased light yield that were caused by leakage of liquid scintillator into the detector due to weakness of detector encapsulation. We upgraded the detector encapsulation design to prevent the leakage of the liquid scintillator. Meanwhile two small-sized detectors were replaced with larger ones resulting in a total mass of 16.7\,kg. With this new design implementation, the detector system has been operating stably since April 2022 for over a year without detector gain drop. In this paper, we present an improved crystal encapsulation design and stability of the NEON experiment.</description>
