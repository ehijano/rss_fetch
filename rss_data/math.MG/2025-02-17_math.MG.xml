      <title>Characterization of quasispheres via smooth approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every two-dimensional quasisphere is the limit of a sequence of smooth spheres that are uniform quasispheres. In the case of metric spheres of finite area we provide necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for a quasisphere, involving the doubling property, linear local connectivity, the Loewner property, conformal modulus, and reciprocity. In particular, although an arbitrary quasisphere does not satisfy necessarily all of those geometric conditions, we prove that every quasisphere can be approximated by uniform quasispheres that are uniformly doubling, linearly locally connected, 2-Loewner, reciprocal and satisfy a uniform bound for the modulus of annuli.</description>

      <title>On creating convexity in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\gamma_n$ denote the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Given a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we let \begin{align*} \mathrm{conv}_k(A) := \{ \lambda_1 s_1 + \ldots + \lambda_k s_k : \lambda_i \geq 0, \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i = 1 , s_i \in A \} \end{align*} be the set of $k$-fold convex combinations of $A$. We show that for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(A) \geq 1- \varepsilon$ such that for all $k = O_\varepsilon(\sqrt{\log \log n})$, $\mathrm{conv}_k(A)$ contains no convex set $K$ of Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(K) \geq \varepsilon$. This provides a negative resolution to a stronger version of a conjecture of Talagrand. Our approach involves applying optimal transport techniques to the empirical coordinate measures of vectors in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>On Cantor sets with arbitrary Hausdorff and packing measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every couple of Hausdorff functions $\psi, \varphi$ verifying some mild assumptions, we construct a compact subset $ K $ of the Baire space such that the $\varphi$-Hausdorff measure and the $\psi$-packing measure on $ K $ are both finite and positive. We then embed such examples in any infinite-dimensional Banach space to answer positively to a question of Fan on the existence of metric spaces with arbitrary scales.</description>

      <title>A note on limsup sets of annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the set of points in infinitely many max-norm annuli centred at rational points in $\mathbb R^{n}$. We give Jarn\'ik-Besicovitch type theorems for this set in terms of Hausdorff dimension. Interestingly, we find that if the outer radii are decreasing sufficiently slowly, dependent only on the dimension $n$, and the thickness of the annuli is decreasing rapidly then the dimension of the set tends towards $n-1$. We also consider various other forms of annuli including rectangular annuli and quasi-annuli described by the difference between balls of two different norms. Our results are deduced through a novel combination of a version of Cassel's Scaling Lemma and a generalisation of the Mass Transference Principle, namely the Mass transference principle from rectangles to rectangles due to Wang and Wu (Math. Ann. 2021).</description>

      <title>Fractal dimensions and profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a finitely branching rooted tree such that any node has at least two successors. The path space $[T]$ is an ultrametric space where the distance of distinct paths $f,g$ is $1/|T_n|$, with $T_n$ denoting the set of nodes at distance $n$ from the root. Let $S$ be a subtree of $T$ without leaves that is level-wise uniformly branching, in the sense that the number of successors of a node only depends on its distance from the root. We show that the Hausdorff and lower box dimensions coincide for~$[S]$, and the packing and upper box dimensions also coincide. We give geometric proofs, as well as proofs based on the point to set principles. We use the first result to reprove a result of Barnea and Shalev on the dimension of closed subgroups of a profinite group $G$, referring only on the geometric structure of the closed subgroup in the canonical path space given by an inverse system for $G$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Higson coronas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that under mild set theoretic hypotheses we have rigidity for algebras of continuous functions over Higson coronas, topological spaces arising in coarse geometry. In particular, we show that under $\mathsf{OCA}$ and $\mathsf {MA}_{\aleph_1}$, if two uniformly locally finite metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ have homeomorphic Higson coronas $\nu X$ and $\nu Y$, then $X$ and $Y$ are coarsely equivalent, a statement which provably does not follow from $\mathsf{ZFC}$ alone.</description>

      <title>A tropical approach to rigidity: counting realisations of frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A realisation of a graph in the plane as a bar-joint framework is rigid if there are finitely many other realisations, up to isometries, with the same edge lengths. Each of these finitely-many realisations can be seen as a solution to a system of quadratic equations prescribing the distances between pairs of points. For generic realisations, the size of the solution set depends only on the underlying graph so long as we allow for complex solutions. We provide a characterisation of the realisation number - that is the cardinality of this complex solution set - of a minimally rigid graph. Our characterisation uses tropical geometry to express the realisation number as an intersection of Bergman fans of the graphic matroid. As a consequence, we derive a combinatorial upper bound on the realisation number involving the Tutte polynomial. Moreover, we provide computational evidence that our upper bound is usually an improvement on the mixed volume bound.</description>

      <title>Monotone Sequences of Metric Spaces with Compact Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a fixed metric space (possibly an oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary) with an increasing sequence of distance functions and a uniform upper bound on diameter. When the metric space endowed with the pointwise limit of these distances is compact, then there is uniform and Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) convergence to this limit. When the metric space also has an integral current structure of uniformly bounded total mass (as is true for an oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary that has a uniform bound on total volume), we prove volume preserving intrinsic flat convergence to a subset of the GH limit whose closure is the whole GH limit. We provide a review of all notions and have a list of open questions at the end. Dedicated to Xiaochun Rong.</description>

      <title>The Lamplighter groups have infinite weak cop number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, a variation of the cop number, is an invariant suitable for infinite graphs and is a quasi-isometric invariant. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist locally finite infinite graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists locally finite vertex transitive graphs whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We test this question on Cayley graphs of wreath products, these are objects known for their exotic geometries. We prove that Cayley graphs of wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. The result is proved by defining a new pursuit and evasion game and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. We also include a short argument that Cayley graphs of Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak cop number.</description>
