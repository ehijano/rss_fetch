      <title>Magnetic field of a linear octupole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the magnetic field produced by a linear octupole formed by four magnets placed in such a way that both their magnetic moments and their quadrupole moments cancel each other. The magnetic field is measured with the magnetic sensor of a smartphone together with a suitable app, using the Android operating system. The main objective is to determine the dependence of the x-component of the magnetic field with distance and compare with the theoretical result that tells us that this dependence is a quintic decrease.</description>

      <title>A Low-Frequency Vibration Experimental Platform for University Physics Experiment Designed by LabVIEW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual instrument technology has been increasingly used in university physics experiment teaching. An experimental platform is specifically constructed for studying low-frequency vibrations in university physics, which is based on a computer and its internal sound card, along with a program developed in LabVIEW programming environment to perform control and measurement on our experimental platform. The proposed platform effectively replaces the conventional signal generator and oscilloscope traditionally used in such experiments by integrating virtual instruments and essential experimental equipment. The platform offers various functionalities, such as synchronous transmission and reception of low-frequency signals, frequency measurement, dynamic frequency sweep measurement, and measurement using the three-point approximation method. The proposed platform has been successfully applied in experiments involving forced vibration, resonance of tuning forks, and dynamic measurement of Young's modulus. Unlike conventional low-frequency vibration experiments, the proposed experimental platform optimizes efficiency, reduces costs, and offers opportunities for enhancing the instructional content of experiments. Furthermore, the incorporation of state-of-the-art computer technology enhances students' engagement and enthusiasm for learning.</description>

      <title>Ethel: A Virtual Teaching Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has shown potential in solving physics problems and providing feedback on assessments. However, results are sometimes still inaccurate, at the wrong level, or using notations and definitions not appropriate for a particular course. A possible solution is augmenting the prompts with course-specific reference materials. Also, for feedback on homework solutions and grading exams, the problem text and the sample solution or grading rubric can be injected into the prompts. Project Ethel at ETH Zurich aims to construct a virtual teaching assistant using these practices.</description>

      <title>Communicating the gravitational-wave discoveries of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration has made breakthrough discoveries in gravitational-wave astronomy, a new field of astronomy that provides a different means of observing our Universe. Gravitational-wave discoveries are possible thanks to the work of thousands of people from across the globe working together. In this article, we discuss the range of engagement activities used to communicate LVK gravitational-wave discoveries and the stories of the people behind the science using the activities surrounding the release of the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog as a case study.</description>
