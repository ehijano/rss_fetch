      <title>A Comprehensive Guide to the U.S. Civil Space Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the U.S. federal civil space budget between FY23 and proposed spending in FY25, providing a foundational reference dataset for civil space budget analyses. Projects that support, enable, or leverage space activities for civil purposes are found in more than 100 individual line items spread across 17 federal departments and agencies and are funded by 4 different appropriations bills. Across all these elements, civil space-related appropriations total roughly 44 billion dollars in FY25, of which NASA constitutes about 58 percent (Figure 1).
  To better view the cross-cutting nature of space missions and the support that enables them, the second half of this report introduces a novel representation of the civil space budget by organizing the data into six national priority areas: American Leadership and Manufacturing; Workforce Development; Fundamental Science; Efficiency, Improvements, and Growth; Homeland Security; Infrastructure, Energy, and Resiliency; and Remote Sensing Applications (Figure 2). This organization of the data highlights the ubiquity of space-related activity throughout diverse sectors to reach the same common goal.</description>

      <title>Physical Constraint Preserving Higher Order Finite Volume Schemes for Divergence-Free Astrophysical MHD and RMHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher order finite volume schemes for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) are very valuable because they allow us to carry out astrophysical simulations with very high accuracy. However, astrophysical problems sometimes have unusually large Mach numbers, exceptionally high Lorentz factors and very strong magnetic fields. All these effects cause higher order codes to become brittle and prone to code crashes. In this paper we document physical constraint preserving (PCP) methods for treating numerical MHD and RMHD. While unnecessary for standard problems, for stringent astrophysical problems these methods show their value. We describe higher order methods that allow divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field. We present a novel two-dimensional Riemann solver. This two-dimensional Riemann solver plays a key role in the design of PCP schemes for MHD and RMHD. We present a very simple PCP formulation and show how it is amalgamated with the evolution of face-centered magnetic fields. The methods presented here are time-explicit and do not add much to the computational cost. We show that the methods meet their design accuracies and work well on problems that would otherwise be considered too extreme for typical higher order Godunov methods of the type used in computational astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Micro-Mirror-Devices (MMDs): A New Family of MOEMS for the Habitable World Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new program aimed at developing a new generation of micromirror devices specifically tailored for astronomical applications, multi-slit spectroscopy in particular. We first overview the general characteristics of Multi-Object-Spectrographs based on the current Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs), with particular focus on the newly deployed SAMOS instrument at the 4.1 m SOAR telescope on Cerro Pachon. We illustrate the operational advantages of DMD-based instruments and the technical limitations of the currently available devices, the DMDs produced by Texas Instruments (TI). We then introduce the baseline and target parameters of the new Micro-Mirror-Devices (MMDs) that we plan to develop with the goal of reaching TRL-5 by mid-2029 as required by the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) timeline. We conclude with a brief illustration of the exciting potential of MMD-based spectrographs for an 8 m class space telescope like HWO.</description>

      <title>Daytime Photometry of Starlink Satellites with the Huntsman Telescope Pathfinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in satellite launches in recent years, and the pressure of launches planned into the next decade, demands an improvement in the efficiency of space domain awareness facilities. Optical facilities form an important component of global space domain awareness capabilities, however traditional optical telescopes are restricted to observing satellites during a small twilight window. In this work we explore expanding this operational period to encompass the entire day to dramatically improve the observing opportunities at a single site. We explore daytime space domain awareness observations with the Huntsman Telescope Pathfinder, an instrument built using predominantly off the self components, and Canon telephoto lenses. We report successful detections and photometric light curves of 81 Starlink satellites from Sun altitudes ranging 20 degrees to midday. Starlink satellites are found to be particularly bright at $3.6 \pm 0.05$ mag, $\sigma = 0.6 \pm 0.05$ mag in Sloan r', or $\sim 11\times$ brighter than twilight conditions. We conclude this surprising observed brightness is due to the contribution of Earthshine beneath the orbiting satellites. We also compare our observations to existing satellite optical brightness models and find that satellite optical brightness during the day can only be well described by a model including an Earthshine component. We find that observed light curves are more complex than simple geometric models predict, but generally agree within an order of magnitude. Finally we suggest improvements to satellite optical brightness models by incorporating weather data to measure the actual Earthshine under a satellite.</description>

      <title>Bilateral collaboration between Mexico and the United Kingdom for the construction of technical equipment (CHARM) for the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT/GTM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT), is the largest millimeter radio telescope in the world, and was founded in 2006. This radio telescope is the final product of a collaboration agreement between Mexico and the United States in the 1990s. It is located on top of an extinct volcano in Mexico at an altitude of 4600 meters above sea level. In 2018, the University of Manchester and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory signed an agreement with the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica Optica y Electronica (INAOE) to train Mexican astronomers in high-frequency radio receiver construction techniques by designing an innovative device called Collaborative Heterodyne Amplifier Receiver for Mexico (CHARM) designed to work at a frequency of 345 GHz. The research team, composed of British and Mexican technicians and scientists, installed CHARM at the LMT in 2019 and began testing the equipment until the COVID-19 pandemic shut it down in March 2020. This paper describes the collaboration process between Mexico and the United Kingdom, facilitated by a British institution dedicated to supporting scientific projects in developing countries, the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF).</description>

      <title>Multivariate Time-series Transformer Embeddings for Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical surveys produce time-series data by observing stellar objects across multiple wavelength bands. Foundational transformer-based models, such as Astromer, encode each time-series as a sequence of embeddings of uniform dimensions. However, such models operate independently on each band at a single time and do not natively leverage information across telescope filters. We extend this framework by introducing a fusion mechanism that maps the collection of single-band embeddings to a unified sequence representation, enabling multiband modeling for downstream tasks. The challenge lies in devising a mechanism within the encoder to coordinate between data from different wavelengths, which are often recorded at asynchronous times. We pre-train multiband models on a subset of 600000 high signal-to-noise light curves from the MACHO survey and fine-tune them using the Alcock and ATLAS survey datasets. Experimental results show that both our proposed multiband architectures outperform the single-band models by approximately 10% in F1-score, with jointly pre-trained multiband encoders further improving performance over a collection of independently pre-trained single-band encoders. Furthermore, our experiments show that there are minimal differences in multiband performance when sampling individual band data asynchronously versus sampling all individual bands on the same set of time-steps. However, jointly pre-trained models can take more than twice the time to pre-train. These results demonstrate the trade-offs of the multiband approach where multivariate data are available.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic radio continuum survey maps with diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of radio surveys is going to be transformative for cosmology and other aspects of our understanding of astrophysics. Realistic simulations of radio observations are essential for the design and planning of radio surveys. They are employed in the development of methods for tasks, such as data calibration and reduction, automated analysis and statistical studies in cosmology. We implemented a software for machine learning-assisted simulations of realistic surveys with the LOFAR telescope, resulting in a synthetic radio sky model and a corresponding artificial telescope observation. We employed a diffusion model trained on LoTSS observations to generate individual radio galaxy images with control over the angular size. Single sources are assembled into a radio sky model, using an input catalog from cosmological simulations. We then transformed this sky model into visibilities corresponding to a typical LoTSS pointing. We added realistic noise to this synthetic measurement and obtained our final simulated sky maps through deconvolution. We explored different ways to evaluate our resulting sky model. We were able to simulate realistic LOFAR observations, covering a sky patch of 5x5 degrees at an effective resolution of 8.5 arcseconds. The simulated sources have flux and size distributions that match real observations, and the resulting maps have sensitivities compatible with LoTSS observations. Our diffusion model is able to synthesize high-quality realistic radio galaxy images with precise control over the source sizes. This software can readily be applied to other instruments.</description>

      <title>Insights from a 30-Year international Partnership on Astronomical Archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where astronomical data is expanding at an unprecedented rate, the importance of data sharing and accessibility among astronomy archives cannot be overstated. Since the 1990s, an international partnership between the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) has been focused on this endeavor, facilitating the exchange of data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.
  We will present how this collaboration has evolved over time, highlighting key milestones and innovations in decision-making, communication, and technology. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges we have encountered and the strategies we employed to overcome them, offering insights that could benefit future archive collaborations.</description>

      <title>DBNets2.0: simulation-based inference for planet-induced dust substructures in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust substructures in protoplanetary discs can be signatures of embedded young planets whose detection and characterisation would provide a better understanding of planet formation. Traditional techniques used to link substructures' morphology to the properties of putative embedded planets present several limitations that the use of deep learning methods has partly overcome. In our previous work, we developed DBNets, a tool exploiting an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate the mass of putative planets in disc dust substructures. This inference problem, however, is degenerate as planets of different masses could produce the same rings and gaps if other physical disc properties were different. In this paper, we address this issue improving our simulation-based inference pipeline to estimate the full posterior distribution for the planet mass and three additional disc properties: the disc $\alpha$-viscosity, the scale height and the dust Stokes number. We also address some minor issues of our previous tool. The new pipeline involves a CNN that summarises the input images in a set of summary statistics, followed by an ensemble of normalising flows that model the inferred posterior for the target properties. We tested our pipeline on a dedicated set of synthetic observations using the TARP test and standard metrics, demonstrating its accuracy and precision. Additionally, we use the results obtained on the test set to study the degeneracies between pairs of parameters. Finally, we apply the developed pipeline to a set of 49 gaps in 34 protoplanetary discs' continuum observations. The results show typically low values of $\alpha$-viscosity, disc scale heights, and planet masses, with 83% of them being lower than 1M$_J$. These low masses are consistent with the non-detections of these putative planets in direct imaging surveys. Our tool is publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Potential Danger to Satellites due to Ejecta from a 2032 Lunar Impact by Asteroid 2024 YR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 2032 December 22 the 60 m diameter asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 4% chance of impacting the Moon. Such an impact would release 6.5 MT TNT equivalent energy and produce a ~1 km diameter crater. We estimate that up to 10^8 kg of lunar material could be liberated in such an impact by exceeding lunar escape speed. Depending on the actual impact location on the Moon as much as 10% of this material may accrete to the Earth on timescales of a few days. The lunar ejecta-associated particle fluence at 0.1 - 10 mm sizes could produce upwards of years to of order a decade of equivalent background meteoroid impact exposure to satellites in near-Earth space late in 2032. Our results demonstrate that planetary defense considerations should be more broadly extended to cis-lunar space and not confined solely to near-Earth space.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXVII: The circumbinary disk and the outflow of the L 1551 IRS 5 binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using continuum and $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ line data obtained from the large ALMA program FAUST, we studied the structure of the protostellar binary system L1551 IRS5 at scales between 30 and 3,000 au to constrain its properties, from the circumstellar and circumbinary disks up to the envelope and outflow scales, which exhibits complex and entangled structures at the scales of its inner and outer envelopes, presumably caused by the influence of the central binary. Assuming a dust-to-gas ratio of 100, we calculated the dust+gas mass for the circumbinary disk and each circumstellar disk of the binary, obtaining 0.018 M$_{\odot}$, for the circumbinary disk, 0.004 M$_{\odot}$, and 0.002 M$_{\odot}$, for the northern and southern circumstellar disk respectively. From the line emission, we retrieved the gas masses for each structure component. With the $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ PV diagram along the circumbinary disk, we were able to constrain the centrifugal barrier, $r_{CB}=55$ au, update the specific angular momentum, $j\sim270$~au~km~s$^{-1}$. We built an analytical model that can be used to predict the influence of the morphology of the outflow and a few dynamic features that can reproduce the system emission, allowing us to explain and discern the outflow contribution from the complex emission due to the binary. Additionally, we inferred the density power law index, $\alpha=1.7$, and the envelope rotation velocity, $v_{c}=2$~km~s$^{-1}$. Finally, the observations gave us the physical constraints to obtain a coherent outflow model for L1551 IRS5.</description>

      <title>A nanosecond-duration radio pulse originating from the defunct Relay 2 satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of a burst of emission over a 695.5 MHz-1031.5 MHz bandwidth by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP. The burst was localised through analysis of near-field time delays to the long-decommissioned Relay 2 satellite, and exhibited a dispersion measure of $2.26 \cdot 10^{-5}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ -- 69.7 TECU, consistent with expectations for a single pass through the ionosphere. After coherent dedispersion, the burst was determined to be less than 30 ns in width, with an average flux density of at least 300 kJy. We consider an electrostatic discharge (ESD) or plasma discharge following a micrometeoroid impact to be plausible explanations for the burst. ESDs have previously been observed with the Arecibo radio telescope, but on 1000 times longer timescales. Our observation opens new possibilities for the remote sensing of ESD, which poses a serious threat to spacecraft, and reveals a new source of false events for observations of astrophysical transients.</description>

Abstract: The redshifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization carries invaluable information about the cosmology and astrophysics of the early Universe. Analyzing data from a sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment requires navigating through an intricate parameter space addressing various factors such as foregrounds, beam uncertainties, ionospheric distortions, and receiver noise for the search of the 21-cm signal. The traditional likelihood-based sampling methods for modeling these effects could become computationally demanding for such complex models, which makes it infeasible to include physically motivated 21-cm signal models in the analysis. Moreover, the inference is driven by the assumed functional form of the likelihood. We demonstrate how Simulation-Based Inference through Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) can naturally handle these issues at a reduced computational cost. We estimate the posterior distribution on our model parameters with TMNRE for simulated mock observations, incorporating beam-weighted foregrounds, physically motivated 21-cm signal, and radiometric noise. We find that maximizing information content by analyzing data from multiple time slices and antennas significantly improves the parameter constraints and enhances the exploration of the cosmological signal. We discuss the application of TMNRE for the current configuration of the REACH experiment and demonstrate its potential for exploring new avenues.</description>

      <title>A Next-Generation Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework for Transmission Spectroscopy (NEXOTRANS): Comparative Characterization for WASP-39 b Using JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI Observations</title>

Abstract: The advent of JWST has marked a new era in exoplanetary atmospheric studies, offering higher-resolution data and greater precision across a broader spectral range than previous space-based telescopes. Accurate analysis of these datasets requires advanced retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces. We present NEXOTRANS, an atmospheric retrieval framework that integrates Bayesian inference using UltraNest/PyMultiNest with four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Stacking Regressor. This hybrid approach enables a comparison between traditional Bayesian methods and computationally efficient machine learning techniques. Additionally, NEXOTRANS incorporates NEXOCHEM, a module for solving equilibrium chemistry. We applied NEXOTRANS to JWST observations of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39 b, spanning wavelengths from 0.6 microns to 12.0 microns using NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI. Four chemistry models - free, equilibrium, modified hybrid equilibrium, and modified equilibrium-offset chemistry - were explored to retrieve precise Volume Mixing Ratios (VMRs) for H2O, CO2, CO, H2S, and SO2. Absorption features in both NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI data constrained SO2 log VMRs to values between -6.25 and -5.73 for all models except equilibrium chemistry. High-altitude aerosols, including ZnS and MgSiO3, were inferred, with constraints on their VMRs, particle sizes, and terminator coverage fractions, providing insights into cloud composition. For the best-fit modified hybrid equilibrium model, we derived super-solar elemental abundances of O/H = 14.12 (+2.86/-1.82) x solar, C/H = 21.37 (+4.93/-3.18) x solar, and S/H = 5.37 (+0.79/-0.65) x solar, along with a C/O ratio of 1.35 (+0.05/-0.02) x solar, demonstrating NEXOTRANS's potential for atmospheric characterization in the JWST era and beyond.</description>

      <title>Extending the micro-Hertz detection horizons via hidden orbital resonance effect for geocentric gravitational wave antennas</title>

Abstract: The microhertz gravitational wave (GW) band holds critical insights into coalescing supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) and the stochastic GW background, yet remains observationally inaccessible due to technical barriers. This work presents a strategy to unlock this band by exploiting orbital resonance effects in the proposed geocentric GW antennas, circumventing the need for impractical ultralong baselines or advanced technologies. We demonstrate that when GW frequencies resonate with integer multiples of a satellite's orbital frequency, sustained orbital deviations amplify signals through time-cumulative effects. Benifit from orbital modulation and resonance phenomena, detector sensitivity can be enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the microhertz regime. For proposed missions like TianQin, gLISA, and GADFLI, this long-overlooked resonance-induced mechanism extends detectable GW frequencies and expands the observable parameter space of SMBHBs, exceeding conventional sensitivity assessments. This approach may leverage geocentric missions as cost-effective platforms to bridge the microhertz observational gap.</description>
