      <title>Simulation of the impact of an additional corrugated structure impedance on the bursting dynamics in an electron storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the case of single-digit picosecond bunch length, synchrotron light sources produce intense coherent radiation up to the THz range. The reduction of the bunch length by lowering the momentum compaction factor (low-$\alpha$) gives rise to the micro-bunching instability, which is on one hand a crucial roadblock in the X-ray range during to the resulting effective bunch lengthening but on the other hand also an opportunity for the generation of intense THz radiation if it can be controlled appropriately. In the KIT storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator), two parallel plates with periodic rectangular corrugations are planned to be installed in an electron storage ring. These plates create an additional longitudinal impedance based on their geometry, which can affect the beam dynamics. The resulting impedance manipulation will be used to study and control the longitudinal electron beam dynamics and the emitted coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR). This paper presents the results of systematic studies in simulation of the impact of additional corrugated plate impedances on the longitudinal beam dynamics using the example of the KARA storage ring. If the periodicity of the wake function of the corrugated plates matches the size of the substructures in the longitudinal bunch profile, the instability threshold can be effectively manipulated. This extends intense THz radiation to different beam current regimes.</description>

      <title>Excitation of nonlinear second order betatron sidebands for Knock Out slow extraction at the third-integer resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11279</link>

Abstract: Radio Frequency Knock Out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Classically, the beam is excited with an RF field comprising a frequency band around one of the betatron sidebands. This article demonstrates that the third-integer resonance commonly used for the slow extraction induces nonlinear motion, resulting in the appearance of additional sidebands of higher order at multiples of the betatron tune. Measured and simulated beam spectra are presented, revealing these sidebands and the beam's response to being excited at first and second order sidebands. The feasibility of using a second order sideband for the purpose of slow extraction is demonstrated. This results in a significant improvement in the temporal structure (spill quality) of the extracted beam, but at the cost of higher excitation power requirements. This is observed both experimentally and in tracking simulations. The mechanism behind the observed improvement is explained using beam dynamics simulations.</description>
