      <title>Hidden symmetries, hidden conservation laws and exact solutions of dispersionless Nizhnik equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among Lie submodels of the (real symmetric potential) dispersionless Nizhnik equation, we single out a remarkable submodel as such that, despite being the only one, is associated with a family of in general inequivalent one-dimensional subalgebras of the maximal Lie invariance algebra of this equation, which are parameterized by an arbitrary function of the time variable. The wide family of invariant solutions of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation that are related to the above submodel is expressed in terms of an arbitrary function of the time variable and the double quadrature of the well-known (implicit) general solution of the inviscid Burgers equation with respect to a space-like submodel invariant variable. The singled out submodel possesses many other interesting properties. In particular, we show that it is Lie-remarkable, and its maximal Lie invariance algebra completely defines its point symmetry pseudogroup, which provides the second but simpler example of the latter phenomenon in literature. Moreover, only hidden Lie symmetries of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation that are associated with this submodel are essential for finding its exact solutions. Using Lie reductions, we construct new families of exact solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nizhnik equation in closed or parametric form. We also exhaustively described generalized symmetries, cosymmetries and conservation laws of the submodel, which gives the corresponding nonlocal and hidden structures for the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nizhnik equation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Joyce structures and poles of Painlev\'e equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joyce structures are a class of geometric structures that first arose in relation to Donaldson-Thomas theory. There is a special class of examples, called class $S[A_1]$, whose underlying manifold parameterises Riemann surfaces of some fixed genus equipped with a meromorphic quadratic differential with poles of fixed orders. We study two Joyce structures of this type using the isomonodromic systems associated to the Painlev\'e II and III$_3$ equations. We give explicit formulae for the Pleba\'nski functions of these Joyce structures, and compute several associated objects, including their tau functions, which we explicitly relate to the corresponding Painlev\'e tau functions. We show that the behaviour of the Joyce structure near the zero-section can be studied analytically through poles of Painlev\'e equations. The systematic treatment gives a blueprint for the study of more general Joyce structures associated to meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere.</description>

      <title>Blobbed topological recursion and KP integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revise the notion of the blobbed topological recursion by extending it to the setting of generalized topological recursion as well as allowing blobs which do not necessarily admit topological expansion. We show that the so-called non-perturbative differentials form a special case of this revisited version of blobbed topological recursion. Furthermore, we prove the KP integrability of the differentials of blobbed topological recursion for the input data that include KP-integrable blobs. This result generalizes, unifies, and gives a new proof of the KP integrability of nonperturbative differentials conjectured by Borot--Eynard and recently proved by the authors.</description>

      <title>Exact Spin Correlators of Integrable Quantum Circuits from Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions of strings of spin operators for integrable quantum circuits exactly. These observables can be used for calibration of quantum simulation platforms. We use algebraic Bethe Ansatz, in combination with computational algebraic geometry to obtain analytic results for medium-size (around 10-20 qubits) quantum circuits. The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a local charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>
