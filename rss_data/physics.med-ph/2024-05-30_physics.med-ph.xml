      <title>A Staged Approach using Machine Learning and Uncertainty Quantification to Predict the Risk of Hip Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in medical care, hip fractures impose a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems. This paper focuses on the prediction of hip fracture risk in older and middle-aged adults, where falls and compromised bone quality are predominant factors. We propose a novel staged model that combines advanced imaging and clinical data to improve predictive performance. By using CNNs to extract features from hip DXA images, along with clinical variables, shape measurements, and texture features, our method provides a comprehensive framework for assessing fracture risk. A staged machine learning-based model was developed using two ensemble models: Ensemble 1 (clinical variables only) and Ensemble 2 (clinical variables and DXA imaging features). This staged approach used uncertainty quantification from Ensemble 1 to decide if DXA features are necessary for further prediction. Ensemble 2 exhibited the highest performance, achieving an AUC of 0.9541, an accuracy of 0.9195, a sensitivity of 0.8078, and a specificity of 0.9427. The staged model also performed well, with an AUC of 0.8486, an accuracy of 0.8611, a sensitivity of 0.5578, and a specificity of 0.9249, outperforming Ensemble 1, which had an AUC of 0.5549, an accuracy of 0.7239, a sensitivity of 0.1956, and a specificity of 0.8343. Furthermore, the staged model suggested that 54.49% of patients did not require DXA scanning. It effectively balanced accuracy and specificity, offering a robust solution when DXA data acquisition is not always feasible. Statistical tests confirmed significant differences between the models, highlighting the advantages of the advanced modeling strategies. Our staged approach could identify individuals at risk with a high accuracy but reduce the unnecessary DXA scanning. It has great promise to guide interventions to prevent hip fractures with reduced cost and radiation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Optical Anisotropy of the Morpho Butterfly Wing for Quantitative, Stain-Free, and Contact-Free Assessment of Biological Tissue Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changes in the density and organization of fibrous biological tissues often accompany the progression of serious diseases ranging from fibrosis to neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease and cancer. However, challenges in cost, complexity, or precision faced by existing imaging methodologies pose barriers to elucidating the role of tissue microstructure in disease. Here, we leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing and introduce Morpho-Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE-PoL), a stain- and contact-free imaging platform which enhances and quantifies the birefringent material properties of fibrous biological tissues. We develop a mathematical model, based on Jones calculus, which quantifies fibrous tissue density and organization. As a representative example, we analyze collagen-dense and collagen-sparse human breast cancer tissue sections and leverage our technique to assess the microstructural properties of distinct regions of interest. We compare our results with conventional Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining procedures and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy for fibrillar collagen detection. Our findings demonstrate that our MorE-PoL technique provides a robust, quantitative, and accessible route toward analyzing biological tissue microstructures, with great potential for application to a broad range of biological materials.</description>

      <title>Rational Approximation of Golden Angles: Accelerated Reconstructions with Simple and Numerically Reproducible Radial Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a generic radial sampling scheme that combines the advantages of golden ratio sampling with simplicity of equidistant angular patterns. The irrational angle between consecutive spokes in golden ratio based sampling schemes enables a flexible retrospective choice of temporal resolution, while preserving good coverage of k-space for each individual bin. Nevertheless, irrational increments prohibit precomputation of the point-spread function (PSF), can lead to numerical problems, and require more complex processing steps. To avoid these problems, a new sampling scheme based on a rational approximation of golden angles (RAGA) is developed.
  Methods: The theoretical properties of RAGA sampling are mathematically derived. Sidelobe-to-peak ratios (SPR) are numerically computed and compared to the corresponding golden ratio sampling schemes. The sampling scheme is implemented in the BART toolbox and in a radial gradient-echo sequence. Feasibility is shown for quantitative imaging in a phantom and a cardiac scan of a healthy volunteer.
  Results: RAGA sampling can accurately approximate golden ratio sampling and has almost identical PSF and SPR. In contrast to golden ratio sampling, each frame can be reconstructed with the same equidistant trajectory using different sampling masks, and the angle of each acquired spoke can be encoded as a small index, which simplifies processing of the acquired data.
  Conclusion: RAGA sampling provides the advantages of golden ratio sampling while simplifying data processing, rendering it a valuable tool for dynamic and quantitative MRI.</description>
