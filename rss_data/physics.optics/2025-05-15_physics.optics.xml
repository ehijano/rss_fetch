      <title>Petahertz-bandwidth spectral combs from the amplified spontaneous emission of a collisional plasma-based x-ray laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of generating spectral combs of petahertz bandwidth is demonstrated from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of a collisional plasma-based x-ray laser when its active medium is irradiated with a linearly polarized near-infrared (IR) laser field. It is shown that at a sufficiently high IR-field intensity these combs correspond to a sequence of subfemtosecond beats of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation of a deterministic shape. At the same time, at a lower IR-field intensity ASE remains quasimonochromatic, but its frequency shifts as a result of the IR-induced quadratic Stark effect. In this case, the frequency tuning range of XUV radiation is approximately twice the frequency of the modulating IR field. In addition, modulation by the IR field leads to amplitude and frequency discrimination of the polarization components of ASE, parallel and orthogonal to the IR field. The possibility of observing these effects is analyzed for a collisional plasma x-ray laser based on neon-like Ti12+ ions with an unperturbed ASE wavelength of 32.6 nm and a modulating field with a wavelength of 1 {\mu}m and an intensity in the range of 10^16 - 10^17 W/cm^2.</description>

      <title>Scalable Trapped Ion Addressing with Adjoint-optimized Multimode Photonic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computing requires precise optical control for individual qubit manipulation. However, conventional free-space optics face challenges in alignment stability and scalability as the number of qubits increases. Integrated photonics offers a promising alternative, providing miniaturized optical systems on a chip. Here, we propose a design for a multimode photonic circuit integrated with a surface-electrode ion trap capable of targeted and reconfigurable light delivery. Three closely positioned ions can be addressed using a focusing grating coupler that emits multimode light through electrode openings to ions trapped 80 $\mu$m above the chip. Simulations show that the couplers achieve diffraction-limited spot with a 4.3 $\mu$m beam waist along the trap axis and 2.2 $\mu$m perpendicular to the trap axis. Controlled interference of the TE$_{\text{10}}$ and TE$_{\text{20}}$ modes results in crosstalk of -20 dB to -30 dB at ion separations of 5-8 $\mu$m when addressing ions individually, and down to -60 dB when two of the three ions are addressed simultaneously. Additionally, the higher-order TE modes can offer a novel mechanism for driving spin-motion coupling transitions, potentially enabling alternative approaches to quantum gates and simulations. The proposed integrated platform offers a viable path for constructing large-scale trapped-ion systems, leveraging the benefits of nanophotonic design for precise and reliable ion manipulation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Offset of Excited States in Non-Hermitian Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of light-wave packets injected into
  non-Hermitian microcavity lattices under highly dissipative
  conditions. While all eigenstates of the lattice exhibit exponential
  decay, a specifically excited state maintains coherent propagation. In
  a one-dimensional lattice, this state undergoes a spatial
  displacement shift away from the injection position, which is
  a fundamental property of non-Hermitian systems with a point
  gap when the spectrum encircles a finite region in the
  complex plane. Extending such a shift to two-dimensional lattices reveals
  a geometrically anomalous V-shaped wave packet formation with orientation-tunable arms.
  Notably, this geometric control mechanism
  enables all-optical steering of non-Hermitian photonic states without
  requiring structural modifications.</description>

      <title>Photoswitchable exceptional points derived from bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) and exceptional points (EPs), as two distinct physical singularities represented by complex frequencies in non-Hermitian systems, have garnered significant attention and clear definitions in their respective fields in recent years. They share overlapping applications in areas such as high-sensitivity sensing and laser emission. However, the transition between the two, inspired by these intersections, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we reveal the transition process in a non-Hermitian two-mode system, evolving from one bound singularity to a two-dimensional exceptional ring, where the EP is the coalescent state of the quasi-Friedrich-Wintgen (FW)-BIC. This phenomenon is experimentally validated through pored dielectric metasurfaces in terahertz band. Furthermore, external pumping induced photocarriers as the dissipative perturbation, facilitates the breaking of degeneracy in the complex eigenfrequency and enables dynamic EP switching. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate a switchable terahertz beam deflection driven by the phase singularities of the EP. These findings are instrumental in advancing the development of compact devices for sensing and wavefront control within non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Photonic Chip Design via Interpretable Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic chip design has seen significant advancements with the adoption of inverse design methodologies, offering flexibility and efficiency in optimizing device performance. However, the black-box nature of the optimization approaches, such as those used in inverse design in order to minimize a loss function or maximize coupling efficiency, poses challenges in understanding the outputs. This challenge is prevalent in machine learning-based optimization methods, which can suffer from the same lack of transparency. To this end, interpretability techniques address the opacity of optimization models. In this work, we apply interpretability techniques from machine learning, with the aim of gaining understanding of inverse design optimization used in designing photonic components, specifically two-mode multiplexers. We base our methodology on the widespread interpretability technique known as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, or LIME. As a result, LIME-informed insights point us to more effective initial conditions, directly improving device performance. This demonstrates that interpretability methods can do more than explain models -- they can actively guide and enhance the inverse-designed photonic components. Our results demonstrate the ability of interpretable techniques to reveal underlying patterns in the inverse design process, leading to the development of better-performing components.</description>

      <title>Production-ready double-side fabrication of dual-band infrared meta-optics using deep-UV lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09488v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet interband plasmonics down to the vacuum UV with ultrathin amorphous silicon nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon dominates electronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photonics thanks to its suitable properties, abundance, and well-developed cost-effective manufacturing processes. Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from surface plasmonic to epsilon-near-zero plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Subskin modes in a nonlinear non-Hermitian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subskin modes are distinct from conventional skin modes as they localize not at the system's edge but rather below the edge. Unlike skin modes, where a substantial number of them can accumulate at the boundaries of a system due to the non-Hermitian skin effect, subskin modes are typically limited to one or a few and emerge only when the size of the system and the couplings are related in a very specific way. The nonlinear interaction can lift the restrictions on the couplings for the formation of these modes. The findings reveal the potential of subskin modes for practical applications and new research in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>TorchGDM: A GPU-Accelerated Python Toolkit for Multi-Scale Electromagnetic Scattering with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present "torchGDM", a numerical framework for nano-optical simulations based on the Green's Dyadic Method (GDM). This toolkit combines a hybrid approach, allowing for both fully discretized nano-structures and structures approximated by sets of effective electric and magnetic dipoles. It supports simulations in three dimensions and for infinitely long, two-dimensional structures. This capability is particularly suited for multi-scale modeling, enabling accurate near-field calculations within or around a discretized structure embedded in a complex environment of scatterers represented by effective models. Importantly, torchGDM is entirely implemented in PyTorch, a well-optimized and GPU-enabled automatic differentiation framework. This allows for the efficient calculation of exact derivatives of any simulated observable with respect to various inputs, including positions, wavelengths or permittivity, but also intermediate parameters like Green's tensors. We anticipate that this toolkit will be valuable for applications merging nano-photonics and machine learning, as well as for solving nano-photonic optimization and inverse problems, such as the global design and characterization of metasurfaces, where optical interactions between structures are critical.</description>

      <title>Effects of Random Birefringence in Multimode Fibers on Nonlinear Ultrashort Pulse Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear pulse propagation in multimode fibers (MMFs) has attracted significant attention recently due to the rich spatiotemporal nonlinearities and promising applications. In practical scenarios, random birefringence in MMFs cannot be neglected, affecting the polarization-dependent nonlinear pulse propagation. This paper investigates the influence of random birefringence in MMFs on nonlinear ultrashort pulse propagation using a modified generalized multimode nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Two scenarios, spatial beam self-cleaning and multimode soliton propagation, are specifically examined. It is found that while random birefringence typically weakens nonlinearity in MMFs, certain nonlinear processes such as soliton self-frequency shift caused by intra-pulse Raman effect exhibit a complex relationship with random birefringence. Moreover, the study reveals that beam self-cleaning can endure random birefringence at high input peak powers. This research provides guidance for practical applications that utilize the nonlinear transmission of ultrashort pulses in MMFs.</description>

      <title>0.82 um 105 W diode-pumped thulium-doped all silica fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An all-silica-fiber thulium-doped fiber laser emitting at 0.82 um on the transition from 3H4 to the ground state 3H6 outputs 105 W continuous-wave (CW) power and 555 W quasi-continuous-wave (QCW) instantaneous power with 0.96% duty cycle in 240-us rectangular pulses. The TDFL comprises a double-clad thulium-doped fiber (TDF) which is designed and fabricated in-house and is incorporated into an all-fiber cavity and cladding-pumped by five pigtailed diode lasers at 0.79 um. Co-lasing at 1.9 um counteracts population trapping in 3F4. The slope efficiency relative to absorbed pump power reaches 64% QCW and 77.5% CW. QCW, the beam quality M2 becomes 2.2 (beam parameter product BPP 0.57 mm mrad) and 2.45 (BPP 0.64) in orthogonal directions at ~250 W of instantaneous output power. Additionally, a modified QCW setup is continuously wavelength-tunable from 812 nm to 835 nm. We believe this is the first reported demonstration of high-power laser operation of the 3H4 to 3H6 transition in a TDF. Given also the simplicity and other attractions of an all-silica-fiber laser with direct-diode cladding-pumping, we believe our demonstration is valuable for applications ranging from laser machining of aluminum (benefitting from an absorption peak at 0.83 um) to scientific applications including strontium-based atomic clocks and cesium-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Topological Parity Anomaly and Half-integer Hall Effect in High-dimensional Synthetic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in constructing synthetic dimension provide a powerful tool for exploring exotic topological states of matter in high dimensions. Here we report that the parity anomaly and associated \textit{half-integer} quantized Hall conductance, arising in 2$j$+1 (space-time) dimensions with a single or odd number of Dirac cones, can be realized by the boundary states of $n$-th order topological insulators in (2$j$+$n$)-dimensional synthetic lattices. We establish a general bulk-boundary correspondence by integrating the ``nested" Wilson loop theory with the time-reversal polarization at highly-symmetric momenta, a set of $Z_2$ topological invariants are extracted which determines the number of higher-order-boundary Dirac cones and their locations. We develop a general construction procedure for Hamiltonians supporting such higher-order topological parity anomaly. Moreover, we propose an experimental implementation scheme based on photonic synthetic dimensions and provide a method for probing the associated half-integer Hall conductance by the transmission spectra. Our work offers the realization and characterization of parity anomaly in general high-dimensional higher-order topological insulators and opens an avenue for exploring fundamental physics and possible device applications enabled by manipulating Dirac cones.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Quantum Dot Cavity Placement Using Hyperspectral Imaging with High Spatial Accuracy and Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single emitters in solid state are great sources of single and entangled photons. To boost their extraction efficiency and tailor their emission properties, they are often incorporated in photonic nanostructures. However, achieving accurate and reproducible placement inside the cavity is challenging but necessary to ensure the highest mode overlap and optimal device performance. For many cavity types -- such as photonic crystal cavities or circular Bragg grating cavities -- even small displacements lead to a significantly reduced emitter-cavity coupling. For circular Bragg grating cavities, this yields a significant reduction in Purcell effect, a slight reduction in efficiency and it introduces polarization on the emitted photons. Here we show a method to achieve high accuracy and precision for deterministically placed cavities on the example of circular Bragg gratings on randomly distributed semiconductor quantum dots. We introduce periodic alignment markers for improved marker detection accuracy and investigate overall imaging accuracy achieving $(9.1 \pm 2.5) nm$ through image correction. Since circular Bragg grating cavities exhibit a strong polarization response when the emitter is displaced, they are ideal devices to probe the cavity placement accuracy far below the diffraction limit. From the measured device polarizations, we derive a total spatial process accuracy of $(33.5 \pm 9.9) nm$ based on the raw data, and an accuracy of $(15 \pm 11) nm$ after correcting for the system response, resulting in a device yield of $68 \%$ for well-placed cavities.</description>

The robustness of the experiment on the one hand, and the theoretical description taken from the statistical-mechanics treatment of the heat transfer problem, on the other hand, allows for the study of the arrow of time's problem within the clean and precise framework of experimental optical physics. The central aspect of the experiment is a light beam incident and split at an interface to produce a second common interaction point again at the interface. The experiment was carried out with two light sources that only differ in their coherence length. In the case of the highly coherent light source, we were able to combine the previously split parts of the light back into a single beam. This is indicative of the reversibility of the process of coherent light transmission through the interface. The light source with low coherence length, on the contrary, does not allow for such a recombination, thus producing an irreversible process. We explain how the latter case is analogous to the process of interfacial heat transport, thus establishing an important connection between optical non-coherence and irreversibility of transport phenomena. Our finding paves the way for the study of fundamental processes in heat transfer and the surge of irreversibility in the realm of optical physics.</description>

      <title>Resonant cavity-QED with chiral flat bands</title>

Abstract: Flat bands exhibit high degeneracy and intrinsic localization, offering a promising platform for enhanced light-matter interactions. Here, we investigate the resonant interaction between a two-level emitter and a chiral flat band hosted by a photonic lattice. In the weak coupling regime, the emitter undergoes Rabi oscillations with a lifted photonic mode whose spatial structure reflects the nature of compact localized states and the onset of Anderson localization. We illustrate our approach using selected chiral quasi-1D lattices. Our findings provide a route to flat band state preparation via quench dynamics while preserving the structure of the flat band.</description>

      <title>Flexible single multimode fiber imaging using white LED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimode fiber (MMF) has been proven to have good potential in imaging and optical communication because of its advantages of small diameter and large mode numbers. However, due to the mode coupling and modal dispersion, it is very sensitive to environmental changes. Minor changes in the fiber shape can lead to difficulties in information reconstruction. Here, white LED and cascaded Unet are used to achieve MMF imaging to eliminate the effect of fiber perturbations. The output speckle patterns in three different color channels of the CCD camera produced by transferring images through the MMF are concatenated and inputted into the cascaded Unet using channel stitching technology to improve the reconstruction effects. The average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of the reconstructed images from the Fashion-MINIST dataset is 0.83. In order to check the flexibility of such a system, perturbation tests on the image reconstruction capability by changing the fiber shapes are conducted. The experimental results show that the MMF imaging system has good robustness properties, i. e. the average PCC remains 0.83 even after completely changing the shape of the MMF. This research potentially provides a flexible approach for the practical application of MMF imaging.</description>

      <title>Anderson Localization in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Broadband source-surrounded cloak for on-chip antenna radiation pattern protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the frequency range of electromagnetic wave communication continues to expand and the integration of integrated circuits increases, electromagnetic waves emitted by on-chip antennas are prone to scattering from electronic components, which limits further improvements in integration and the protection of radiation patterns. Cloaks can be used to reduce electromagnetic scattering; however, they cannot achieve both broadband and omnidirectional effectiveness simultaneously. Moreover, their operating modes are typically designed for scenarios where the source is located outside the cloak, making it difficult to address this problem. In this work, we propose a dispersionless air-impedance-matched metamaterial over the 2-8 GHz bandwidth that achieves an adjustable effective refractive index ranging from 1.1 to 1.5, with transmittance maintained above 93%. Based on this metamaterial, we introduce a broadband source-surrounded cloak that can guide electromagnetic waves from a broadband source surrounded by the cloak in any propagation direction to bypass obstacles and reproduce the original wavefronts outside the cloak. Thereby protecting the radiation pattern from distortion due to scattering caused by obstacles. Our work demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the integration density of integrated circuits and improving the operational stability of communication systems.</description>

      <title>A bound state attractor in optical turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study numerically the nonintegrable dynamics of coherent, solitonic, nonlinear waves, in a spatially nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation relevant to realistic modelling of optical systems: the Schrodinger-Helmholtz equation. We observe a single oscillating, coherent solitary wave emerging from a variety of initial conditions. Using the direct scattering transform of the (integrable) cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that this structure is a bound state, comprising of a primary and secondary soliton whose amplitudes oscillate out of phase. We interpret this as the solitons periodically exchanging mass. We observe this bound state self-organising from a state of incoherent turbulence, and from solitonic structures launched into the system. When a single (primary) solitonic structure is launched, a resonance process between it and waves in the system generates the secondary soliton, resulting in the bound state. Further, when two solitons are initially launched, we show that they can merge if their phases are synchronised when they collide. When the system is launched from a turbulent state comprised of many initial solitons, we propose that the bound state formation is preceded a sequence of binary collisions, in which the mass is transferred on average from the weak soliton to the strong one, with occasional soliton mergers. Both processes lead to increasingly stronger and fewer dominant solitons. The final state -- a solitary double-solitonic bound state surrounded by weakly nonlinear waves -- is robust and ubiquitous. We propose that for nonlocal media, it is a more typical statistical attractor than a single-soliton attractor suggested in previous literature.</description>
