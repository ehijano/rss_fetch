      <title>Analysis and applications of the upwind conservation element and solution element scheme for compressible flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upwind conservation element and solution element (CESE) scheme is an alternative discontinuity-capturing numerical approach to solving hyperbolic conservation laws. To evaluate the numerical properties of this spatiotemporal coupled scheme, a formal analysis is conducted on the upwind CESE discretization applied to the linear advection problem. The modified equation and the effective modified wavenumber are derived, which theoretically confirm the order of accuracy and reveal the dissipation and dispersion properties of this scheme. Several examples are considered to demonstrate the capabilities of the upwind CESE scheme for simulating compressible flows, including shock-vortex and shock-bubble interactions. The results of the present scheme agree well with exact solutions, results of other numerical methods, and experimental data. This demonstrates the high resolution of the scheme in capturing shock waves, material interfaces, and small-scale flow structures.</description>

      <title>Goodbye Christoffel Symbols: A Flexible and Efficient Approach for Solving Physical Problems in Curved Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for solving physical equations in curved spaces, especially in fluid mechanics and general relativity, rely heavily on the use of Christoffel symbols. These symbols provide the necessary corrections to account for curvature in differential geometries but lead to significant computational complexity, particularly in numerical simulations. In this paper, we propose a novel, simplified approach that obviates the need for Christoffel symbols by symbolic programming and advanced numerical methods.
  Our approach is based on defining a symbolic mapping between Euclidean space and curved coordinate systems, enabling the transformation of spatial and temporal derivatives through Jacobians and their inverses. This eliminates the necessity of using Christoffel symbols for defining local bases and tensors, allowing for the direct application of physical laws in Cartesian coordinates even when solving problems in curved spaces.
  We demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of our method through several examples, including the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates, the modeling of complex flows in bent cylindrical tubes, and the breakup of viscoelastic fluid threads. These examples highlight how our method simplifies the numerical formulation while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we explore how these advancements benefit free-surface flows, where mapping physical 3D domains to a simpler computational domain is essential for solving moving boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Response of a turbulent boundary layer to steady, square-wave-type transverse wall-forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatial evolution of a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL) imposed by a square-wave (SqW) of steady spanwise wall-forcing, which varies along the streamwise direction ($x$). The SqW wall-forcing is imposed experimentally via a series of streamwise periodic belts running in opposite spanwise directions, following the methodology of Knoop et al., (Exp Fluids, vol 65, 2024), with the streamwise extent increased to beyond $\sim 11$ times the boundary layer thickness (${\delta}_o$) in the present study. This unique setup is leveraged to investigate the influence of viscous-scaled wavelength of SqW wall-forcing on the turbulent drag reduction (DR) efficacy, for $\lambda^+_x = $ 471 (sub-optimal), 942 (near-optimal), and 1884 (post-optimal conditions), at fixed viscous-scaled wall-forcing amplitude, $A^+ = 12$, and friction Reynolds number, $Re_\tau = 960$. The DR mechanisms associated with SqW wall-forcing are elucidated by comparing against established DR mechanisms for traditionally studied sinusoidal forcing (SinW), based on analysis of the streamwise-phase variation of the Stokes strain rate (SSR). The analysis reveals SqW forcing to be a combination of two distinctly different/decoupled SSR states: (i) strong impulses of SSR at half- ($\lambda_x$/2) and full-phase ($\lambda_x$) locations associated with reversal in spanwise forcing directions leading to significant turbulence attenuation, and (ii) near-zero SSR over the remainder of forcing phase that enables turbulence recovery (when wall-forcing magnitudes and direction remain constant). While present experiments are limited to low Reynolds number TBLs, the results are extrapolated to depict a conceptual picture of SqW forcing efficacy in high Reynolds number TBLs (corresponding to a broader scale hierarchy).</description>

      <title>Differentiable Conservative Radially Symmetric Fluid Simulations and Stellar Winds -- jf1uids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present jf1uids, a one-dimensional fluid solver that can, by virtue of a geometric formulation of the Euler equations, model radially symmetric fluid problems in a conservative manner, i.e., without losing mass or energy. For spherical problems, such as ideal supernova explosions or stellar wind-blown bubble expansions, simulating only along a radial dimension drastically reduces compute and memory demands compared to a full three-dimensional method. This simplification also alleviates constraints on backpropagation through the solver. Written in JAX, jf1uids is a GPU-compatible and fully differentiable simulator. We demonstrate the advantages of this differentiable physics simulator by retrieving the wind's parameters for an adiabatic stellar wind expansion from the final fluid state using gradient descent. As part of a larger "stellar winds, cosmic rays and machine learning" research track, jf1uids serves as a solid foundation to be extended with additional physics modules, foremost cosmic rays and a neural-net powered gas-cooling surrogate and improved by higher order and more accurate numerical schemes. All code is available under https://github.com/leo1200/jf1uids/.</description>

      <title>Unsteady aerodynamic response of pitching airfoils represented by Gaussian body forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The actuator line method (ALM) is an approach commonly used to represent lifting and dragging devices like wings and blades in large-eddy simulations (LES). The crux of the ALM is the projection of the actuator point forces onto the LES grid by means of a Gaussian regularisation kernel. The minimum width of the kernel is constrained by the grid size; however, for most practical applications like LES of wind turbines, this value is an order of magnitude larger than the optimal value which maximises accuracy. This discrepancy motivated the development of corrections for the actuator line, which, however, neglect the effect of unsteady spanwise shed vorticity. In this work, we develop a model for the impact of spanwise shed vorticity on the unsteady loading of an airfoil modelled as a Gaussian body force. The model solution is derived both in the time and frequency domain and features an explicit dependence on the Gaussian kernel width. We validate the model with LES within the linear regime of the lift curve for both pitch steps and periodic pitching with reduced frequencies of k=0.1, 0.2 and 0.3. The Gaussian kernel width affects, in particular, the amplitude of the unsteady lift, which can be up to 40% smaller than the quasi-steady amplitude within the considered range of reduced frequencies and kernel widths.</description>

      <title>FIEVel: A Fast InExpensive Velocimeter based on an optical mouse sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid velocimetry is fundamental to a breadth of applications spanning academia and industry, however velocimetry at high temporal resolution is often prohibitively costly. Here, we introduce a Fast and InExpensive Velocimeter (FIEVel) based on an optical mouse sensor. At its core, the optical mouse sensor consists of a small pixel array that acquires image data at high rates, with onboard hardware to compute and output motion in two orthogonal axes directly. By adapting this widely available integrated circuit to fluid velocimetry, we demonstrate that FIEVel is capable of resolving two components of velocity non-intrusively in the bulk of a flowing fluid at rates up to 6.4 kHz, at orders of magnitude lower cost than traditional velocimetry devices. We demonstrate and validate the velocimeter across a range of flows, operating conditions, and illumination strategies. As a sample application, we measure the temporal spectrum of a grid-generated turbulent flow and show excellent agreement with traditional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) using a high-speed camera.</description>

      <title>Classically studied coherent structures only paint a partial picture of wall-bounded turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the last 140 years, the mechanisms of transport and dissipation of energy in a turbulent flow have not been completely understood due to the complexity of this phenomenon. The dissipation of energy due to turbulence is significative, and understanding turbulence physics is crucial for fighting the present climate emergency. Previous research has focused on analyzing the so-called coherent structures of the flow (Q events, streaks, and vortices), which are regions of high turbulence transport, high/low streamwise fluctuation, and rotation, respectively. However, the connection between these classically studied structures and the flow development is still uncertain. To fill this gap, here we show a data-driven methodology for objectively identifying high-importance regions in a turbulent flow. A deep-learning model is trained to predict a future state of a turbulent channel flow and the gradient-SHAP explainability algorithm is used to calculate the importance of each grid point for such a prediction. Finally, high-importance regions are computed using the SHAP data, analyzing and comparing their characteristics with those of the other coherent structures. The SHAP analysis provides an objective way to identify the regions of highest importance in the turbulent flow, which exhibit different levels of agreement with the classically studied structures.</description>

      <title>Understanding Density Fluctuations in Supersonic, Isothermal Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersonic turbulence occurs in many environments, particularly in astrophysics. In the crucial case of isothermal turbulence, the probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density, $s$, is well measured, but a theoretical understanding of the processes leading to this distribution remains elusive. We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to track $s$ and $\frac{ds}{dt}$ in direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions of $s$ and $\frac{ds}{dt}$ decay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is $\approx$ 1/6 the eddy turnover time. The behavior of the conditional averages of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ and $\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$ is also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trajectories and Spectral Boundary Conditions for Enhanced Diffusion in Immersed Boundary Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive framework for enhanced diffusion modeling in fluid-structure interactions by combining the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) with stochastic trajectories and high-order spectral boundary conditions. Using semi-Lagrangian schemes, this approach captures complex diffusion dynamics at moving interfaces, integrating probabilistic methods that reflect multi-scale fluctuations. In addition to a rigorous mathematical foundation that includes stability proofs, this model exhibits reduced numerical diffusion errors and improved stability in long-term simulations. Comparative studies highlight its effectiveness in multi-scale scenarios that require precision in interface dynamics. Focusing on various shear and circular flows, including those with H\"older and Lipschitz regularities and critical points, we establish sharp bounds on effective diffusion rates using specific initial data examples. This dual exploration in enhanced diffusion highlights how flow regularity and critical points influence dissipation. These findings advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of enhanced diffusion in fluid dynamics, offering new insights into diffusion rate optimization through interface dynamics and flow structure regularities. Future research can further refine the IBM framework by exploring alternative probabilistic methods to improve interface accuracy, opening up the potential for improved modeling in applications that require precise control over mixing rates and dissipation processes.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and turbulence in phase-space and formation of phase-space vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the recently introduced fluid-like treatment of the phase-space has been further extended and some interesting outcomes have been presented. A modified form of the Vlasov equation has been presented which describes the diffusion of the phase-space density. This anisotropic diffusion is analysed and the flow of the phase-space probability field is shown. Growth of phase-space vortices is then shown due to increased turbulent-like flow, which is marked by the dominating inertial flow above the diffusive flow. The nature of this flow is judged by using a parameter for the phase-space. It is then shown that the formation of phase-space vortices is due to growth of turbulent-like flow in the phase-space. On the bases of the diffusion parameters, the vorticity field transport of the hydrodynamic phase-space is studied and a Schamel-KdV form of the vorticity transport equation is derived, suggesting solitary modes of the phase-space vorticity waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum Carleman linearisation efficiency in nonlinear fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a specialised branch of fluid mechanics that utilises numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze fluid-flow problems. One promising avenue to enhance CFD is the use of quantum computing, which has the potential to resolve nonlinear differential equations more efficiently than classical computers. Here, we try to answer the question of which regimes of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for fluid dynamics can have an efficient quantum algorithm. We propose a connection between the numerical parameter, $R$, that guarantees efficiency in the truncation of the Carleman linearisation, and the physical parameters that describe the fluid flow. This link can be made thanks to the Kolmogorov scale, which determines the minimum size of the grid needed to properly resolve the energy cascade induced by the nonlinear term. Additionally, we introduce the formalism for vector field simulation in different spatial dimensions, providing the discretisation of the operators and the boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>An extension of the compound flow theory with friction between the streams and at the wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compound flows consist of two or more parallel compressible streams in a duct and their theoretical treatment has gained attention for the analysis and modelling of ejectors. Recent works have shown that these flows can experience choking upstream of the geometric throat. While it is well known that friction can push the sonic section downstream the throat, no mechanism has been identified yet to explain its displacement in the opposite direction. This study extends the existing compound flow theory and proposes a 1D model, including friction between the streams and the duct walls. The model captures the upstream and downstream displacements of the sonic section. Through an analytical investigation of the singularity at the sonic section, it is demonstrated that friction between the streams is the primary driver of upstream displacement. The 1D formulation is validated against axisymmetric Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a compound nozzle for various inlet pressure and geometries. The effect of friction is investigated using an inviscid simulation for the isentropic case and viscous simulations with both slip and no-slip conditions at the wall. The proposed extension accurately captures the displacement of the sonic section, offering a new tool for in-depth analysis and modeling of internal compound flows.</description>

Abstract: A macroscopic hydrodynamic system that couples a particle and a wave has recently renewed interest in the question as to what extent a classical system may reproduce quantum phenomena. Here we investigate single-particle diffraction with a pilot-wave model originally developed to describe the hydrodynamic system. We study single-particle interactions with a barrier and slits of increasing width by focusing on the near field. We find single-particle diffraction arising as wavelike patterns in the particles' position statistics, which we compare to the predictions of quantum mechanics. We provide a mechanism that rationalizes the diffractive behavior in our system.</description>

      <title>Correlations for the interphase drag in the two-fluid model of gas-liquid flows through packed-bed reactors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments conducted by NASA measured the pressure drop due to gas-liquid flow through a packed-bed reactor under microgravity conditions. From these experiments, we develop correlations for the gas-liquid $f_{gl}$ interphase drag in a two-fluid model (TFM). We use an Ergun-type closure for liquid-solid drag. Then, under a 1D flow assumption, $f_{gl}$ is the only unknown in the TFM. Using a data-driven approach, we determine $f_{gl}$ and correlate it (via composite fits) with the liquid and gas Reynolds numbers, $Re_{l}$ and $Re_{g}$, respectively, and the Suratman number $Su_{l}$. To validate the proposed $f_{gl}(Re_{l},Re_{g},Su_{l})$ closure, we perform two-dimensional transient simulations at microgravity conditions using ANSYS Fluent and employing an Euler-Euler formulation. We find good agreement between the simulations based on the proposed $f_{gl}$ closure and the experimental data.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A Monotonic, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian Tracer Transport Scheme for Flow with Large Courant Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local conservation of mass and entropy are becoming increasingly desirable properties for modern numerical weather and climate models. This work presents a Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme, called SWIFT, that facilitates this conservation for tracer variables, whilst maintaining other vital properties such as preservation of a constant, monotonicity and positivity. Importantly, these properties all hold for large Courant numbers and multi-dimensional flow, making the scheme appropriate for use within a dynamical core which takes large time steps.
  The SWIFT scheme presented here can be seen as an evolution of the FFSL methods of Leonard et al and Lin and Rood. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes consist of a splitting into a sequence of one-dimensional calculations. The new SWIFT splitting presented here allows monotonic and positivity properties from the one-dimensional calculations to be inherited by the multi-dimensional scheme. These one-dimensional calculations involve separating the mass flux into terms that correspond to integer and fractional parts of the Courant number. Key to achieving conservation is coupling the transport of tracers to the transport of the fluid density, through re-use of the discrete mass flux that was calculated from the fluid density in the transport of the tracers. This work also describes how these properties can still be attained when the tracer is vertically-staggered from the density in a Charney-Phillips grid.</description>
