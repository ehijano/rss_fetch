      <title>A Unified Framework for High-Dimensional Pure Root Lattices, Sphere Packing, and Cosmological Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework that synthesizes advances in high-dimensional lattice theory with novel computational algorithms for the shortest vector problem (SVP) to model pure root lattices and compute sphere packing densities. Building on our pure root lattice formulation characterized by a novel dimension formula and minimal vector length scaling. we integrate the recent polynomial-time approximation algorithm for SVP and discrete Gaussian sampling techniques. Our work also draws on classical results in sphere packing bounds via spherical codes and the rich structure of exceptional lattices such as the Leech lattice. Finally, we discuss how these results may have cosmological implications specifically, supporting the possibility that our universe emerges from a white hole.</description>

      <title>The hadronic contribution to the running of $\alpha$ and the electroweak mixing angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our update to [1] on the hadronic running of electroweak couplings from $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions with $N_f=2+1$ flavours. The inclusion of additional ensembles at very fine lattice spacings together with a number of techniques to split the different contributions for a better control of cutoff effects allows us to substantially improve the precision. We employ two different discretizations of the vector current to compute the subtracted Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) functions $\bar{\mathit{\Pi}}^{\gamma\gamma}$ and $\bar{\mathit{\Pi}}^{Z\gamma}$ for Euclidean time momenta up to $Q^2\leq 9 \ \mathrm{GeV}^2$ . To reduce cutoff effects in the short distance region we apply a suitable subtraction to the TMR kernel function, which cancels the leading $x_0^4$ behaviour. The subtracted term is then computed in perturbative QCD using the Adler function and added back to compensate for the subtraction. Chiral-continuum extrapolations are performed with five values of the lattice spacing and several pion masses, including its physical value, and several fit ans\"atze are explored to estimate the systematics arising from model selection. Our results show excellent prospects for high-precision estimates of $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(M_Z^2)$ at the Z-pole.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning techniques as noise reduction strategies in lattice calculations of the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice calculations of the hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment are numerically highly demanding due to the necessity of reaching total errors at the sub-percent level. Noise-reduction techniques such as low-mode averaging have been applied successfully to determine the vector-vector correlator with high statistical precision in the long-distance regime, but display an unfavourable scaling in terms of numerical cost. This is particularly true for the mixed contribution in which one of the two quark propagators is described in terms of low modes. Here we report on an ongoing project aimed at investigating the potential of machine learning as a cost-effective tool to produce approximate estimates of the mixed contribution, which are then bias-corrected to produce an exact result. A second example concerns the determination of electromagnetic isospin-breaking corrections by combining the predictions from a trained model with a bias correction.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD constraints on the critical point from an improved precision equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter we employ lattice simulations to search for the critical point of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We search for the onset of a first order QCD transition on the phase diagram by following contours of constant entropy density from imaginary to real chemical potentials under conditions of strangeness neutrality. We scan the phase diagram and investigate whether these contours meet to determine the probability that the critical point is located in a certain region on the $T-\mu_B$ plane. To achieve this we introduce a new, continuum extrapolated equation of state at zero density with improved precision using lattices with $N_\tau=8,10,12,16$ timeslices, and supplement it with new data at imaginary chemical potential. The current precision allows us to exclude, at the $2\sigma$ level, the existence of a critical point at $\mu_B &lt; 450$~MeV.</description>

      <title>Lattice Schwinger Model and Spacetime Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories in (1+1)D have attracted renewed attention partially due to their experimental realizations in quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we revisit the lattice massive Schwinger model and the (1+1)D lattice Abelian-Higgs model, uncovering previously overlooked universal features, including the emergence of a supersymmetric quantum critical point when the Maxwell term's coefficient changes sign. To facilitate the quantum simulation of these theories, we adopt a strategy of truncating the electric field eigenvalues to a finite subset, preserving the exact gauge and global symmetries. Our primary focus is the truncated lattice Schwinger model at $\theta=0$, a model not equivalent to familiar spin models. We find that upon reversing the sign of the Maxwell term, the second-order deconfinement-confinement transition can become first-order, and the two types of transitions are connected by a supersymmetric critical point in the tricritical Ising universality class. In the case of truncated abelian-Higgs model at $\theta=0$, which turns out to be equivalent to the quantum Blume-Capel model, the very existence of a deconfined phase requires a negative-sign Maxwell term. Similarly, there is a tricritical Ising point separating first-order and second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Tomography of Pions and Kaons in the QCD Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the pion and kaon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM), a model of the QCD vacuum at low resolution. The relevant TMDs are factored into a constituent quark distribution times a rapidity dependent soft factor from staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed parton longitudinal momentum and transverse separation. The results are evolved to higher rapidities and higher resolution using the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) renormalization group evolution. The comparison to existing extractions of pion TMDs from Drell-Yan (DY) data is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. We calculate the $\beta$ function of all couplings in the dimensionally reduced Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional with Pauli-G\"ursey SU(4) symmetry. We compare results of the perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.</description>

      <title>Pion condensation versus 2SC, speed of sound, and charge neutrality effects in the quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model as a low-energy model for QCD at non-zero quark and isospin chemical potentials $\mu$ and $\mu_I$, and at zero temperature. We map out the phase diagram in the $\mu$-$\mu_I$ plane, which has four phases: a vacuum phase, a phase with condensed charged pions/Cooper pairs of $u$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks, a normal quark matter phase, and a color superconducting phase (2SC phase). %In the 2SC phase, we study the effects of imposing color and %electric charge neutrality. The global symmetry breaking $SU(3)_c\rightarrow SU(2)_c$ in the 2SC phase gives rise to a number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We classify them and briefly discuss their properties. We calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ in the two special cases, finite $\mu_I$ and $\mu=0$, and finite $\mu$ and $\mu_I=0$. In both cases, the speed of sound exhibits a maximum and approaches the conformal limit from above as the density increases. For non-zero isospin $\mu_I$, this behavior is in agreement with the speed of sound obtained from lattice simulations. In the 2SC phase, the behavior is qualitatively the same if we impose local charge neutrality. Finally, we discuss the possibility of having a mixed phase of negatively charged normal quark matter and positively charged 2SC matter with global color charge neutrality imposed on the latter.</description>

      <title>Gribov copies in the quark propagator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of Gribov copies on the quark propagator in lattice 2-colour QCD. We find that the Gribov noise is comparable to the gauge noise for smaller volumes but becomes less significant for larger spatial volumes. The Gribov noise in the quark propagator is found to be comparable to, but smaller than in the gluon propagator on the same ensembles. No correlation is found between the values of the wave function Z(p) and the value of the gauge fixing functional, nor between the two form factors. A very mild negative correlation was found between the value of the quark mass function M(p) and the gauge fixing functional.</description>

      <title>Non-local Nucleon Matrix Elements in the Rest Frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting parton structure from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations requires studying the coordinate scale $z_3$ dependence of the matrix elements of bilocal operators. The most significant contribution comes from the $z_3$ dependence induced by ultraviolet (UV) renormalization of the Wilson line. We demonstrate that the next-to-leading order perturbative calculations of the renormalization factor can describe, to a few percent accuracy, the logarithm of the lattice QCD rest frame matrix elements with separations up to distances of 0.6~fm on multiple lattice spacings. The residual discrepancies can be modeled by a leading effect from the structure of the nucleon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-spin asymmetries observed in polarised deep-inelastic scattering are important probes of hadron structure. The Sivers asymmetry has been the focus of much attention in QCD phenomenology and is yet to be understood at the quark level. In this Letter, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the spatial distribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton. We determine a spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent force distributions with local forces on the order of 3 GeV/fm. These distributions offer a complementary picture of the Sivers asymmetry in transversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have claimed that the strong $CP$ problem does not occur in QCD, proposing a new order of limits in volume and topological sectors when studying observables on the lattice. We study the effect of the topological term on a simple quantum mechanical rotor that allows a lattice description. We particularly focus on recent proposals to face the challenging problems that this study poses in lattice QCD and that are also present in the quantum rotor, such as topology freezing and the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of splitting of the chiral and deconfinement transition due to rotation in QCD: the phase diagram of linear sigma model coupled to Polyakov loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of rigid rotation on the critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral transitions in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and the Polyakov loop. We point out the essential role of the causality condition, which requires that any point of the system should rotate slower than the velocity of light. We show that imposing this physical requirement leads to inhibition of the splitting between the chiral and confining transitions, which becomes negligibly small ({\Delta}T ~ 1 MeV or less) for experimentally relevant, slow angular velocities {\Omega} ~ 10 MeV of a 5-10 fm-sized systems. Moreover, the boundedness of the system has a much bigger effect on temperature splitting than the rotation itself: the splitting reaches 10 MeV in a small, one-fermi-sized non-rotating system. The temperature splitting may, however, become enhanced in an academic limit of ultra-relativistic regimes when the boundary of the system rotates at near-to-light velocities.</description>
