      <title>RUL-QMoE: Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Remaining Useful Life Predictions of Varying Battery Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are the major type of battery used in a variety of everyday applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), mobile devices, and energy storage systems. Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring their reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness in battery-powered systems. The materials used for the battery cathodes and their designs play a significant role in determining the degradation rates and RUL, as they lead to distinct electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, RUL prediction models often overlook the cathode materials and designs to simplify the model-building process, ignoring the effects of these electrochemical reactions. Other reasons are that specifications related to battery materials may not always be readily available, and a battery might consist of a mix of different materials. As a result, the predictive models that are developed often lack generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel material-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for predicting the RUL of batteries, specifically addressing the complexities associated with heterogeneous battery chemistries. The MoE is integrated into a probabilistic framework, called Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Prediction (RUL-QMoE), which accommodates battery operational conditions and enables uncertainty quantification. The RUL-QMoE model integrates specialized expert networks for five battery types: LFP, NCA, NMC, LCO, and NMC-LCO, within a gating mechanism that dynamically assigns relevance based on the battery's input features. Furthermore, by leveraging non-crossing quantile regression, the proposed RUL-QMoE produces coherent and interpretable predictive distributions of the battery's RUL, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in the battery's RUL prediction.</description>

      <title>Beamforming for Massive MIMO Aerial Communications: A Robust and Scalable DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed beamforming framework for a constellation of airborne platform stations (APSs) in a massive Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) non-terrestrial network (NTN) that targets the downlink sum-rate maximization under imperfect local channel state information (CSI). We propose a novel entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach where each non-terrestrial base station (NTBS) independently computes its beamforming vector using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to capture long-range dependencies in the frequency domain. To ensure scalability and robustness, the proposed framework integrates transfer learning based on a conjugate prior mechanism and a low-rank decomposition (LRD) technique, thus enabling efficient support for large-scale user deployments and aerial layers. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline schemes including WMMSE, ZF, MRT, CNN-based DRL, and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in terms of average sum rate, robustness to CSI imperfection, user mobility, and scalability across varying network sizes and user densities. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method achieves significant computational efficiency compared to CNN-based and WMMSE methods, while reducing communication overhead in comparison with shared-critic DRL approaches.</description>

      <title>A multimodal Transformer for InSAR-based ground deformation forecasting with cross-site generalization across Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-real-time regional-scale monitoring of ground deformation is increasingly required to support urban planning, critical infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation. While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Multi-Region Beam Coverage: A Multi-Notch-Filter-Inspired Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance wireless communication performance by exploiting the new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna position optimization. In this letter, we investigate the MA-enhanced wide beam coverage over multiple subregions in the spatial domain. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum beam gain over the desired subregions by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and antenna position vector (APV). Although this problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve it by leveraging the similarity between the considered multi-region coverage and classical multi-notch filter (MNF) design. In particular, we construct a spatial MNF-based transmit beamforming vector by assuming a continuous amplitude and phase-shift profile within the antenna movement region. Based on this continuous profile, we propose a sequential update algorithm to select an optimal subset of MA positions for multi-region coverage, jointly with a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure to avoid undesired local optimum. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform conventional fixed position antennas (FPAs) and achieve a comparable performance to the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with dramatically lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Discovering Optimal Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs) through Exhaustive Search and Algebraic Formulation of a New Sub-Optimal RMRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern sparse arrays are maximally economic in that they retain just as many sensors required to provide a specific aperture while maintaining a hole-free difference coarray. As a result, these are susceptible to the failure of even a single sensor. Contrarily, two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRSAs) and robust minimum redundancy arrays (RMRAs) ensure robustness against single-sensor failures due to their inherent redundancy in their coarrays. At present, optimal RMRA configurations are known only for arrays with sensor counts N=6 to N=10. To this end, this paper proposes two objectives: (i) developing a systematic algorithm to discover optimal RMRAs for N&gt;10, and (ii) obtaining a new family of near-/sub-optimal RMRA that can be completely specified using closed-form expressions (CFEs). We solve the combinatorial optimization problem of finding RMRAs using an exhaustive search technique implemented in MATLAB. Optimal RMRAs for N = 11 to 14 were successfully found and near/sub-optimal arrays for N = 15 to 20 were determined using the proposed technique. As a byproduct of the exhaustive search, a large catalogue of valid near- and sub-optimal RMRAs was also obtained. In the second stage, CFEs for a new TFRSA were obtained by applying pattern mining and algebraic generalizations to the arrays obtained through exhaustive search. The proposed family enjoys CFEs for sensor positions, available aperture, and achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs). The CFEs have been thoroughly validated using MATLAB and are found to be valid for $N\geq8$. Hence, it can be concluded that the novelty of this work is two-fold: extending the catalogue of known optimal RMRAs and formulating a sub-optimal RMRA that abides by CFEs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the advantage of vector over scalar magnetic sensor networks for undersea surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monitoring of maritime environments is an important problem for monitoring and optimising shipping, as well as national security. New developments in compact, fibre-coupled quantum magnetometers have led to the opportunity to critically evaluate how best to create such a sensor network. Here we explore various magnetic sensor network architectures for target identification. Our modelling compares networks of scalar vs vector magnetometers. We implement an unscented Kalman filter approach to perform target tracking, and we find that vector networks provide a significant improvement in target tracking, specifically tracking accuracy and resilience compared with scalar networks.</description>

      <title>OptiVote: Non-Coherent FSO Over-the-Air Majority Vote for Communication-Efficient Distributed Federated Learning in Space Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity spectral shaping method for OFDM signals with dynamically adaptive emission mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals with rectangular pulses exhibit low spectral confinement. Shaping their power spectral density (PSD) is imperative in the increasingly overcrowded spectrum to benefit from the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. However, since the available spectrum is non-contiguous and its occupancy changes with time, the spectral shaping solution has to be dynamically adapted. This work proposes a framework that allows using a reduced set of preoptimized pulses to shape the spectrum of OFDM signals, irrespective of its spectral width and location, by means of simple transformations. The employed pulses combine active interference cancellation (AIC) and adaptive symbol transition (AST) terms in a transparent way to the receiver. They can be easily adapted online by the communication device to changes in the location or width of the transmission band, which contrasts with existing methods of the same type that require solving NP-hard optimization problems.</description>

      <title>The Wigner-Ville Transform as an Information Theoretic Tool in Radio-frequency Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel interpretations to the field of classical signal processing of the Wigner-Ville transform as an information measurement tool. The transform's utility in detecting and localizing information-laden signals amidst noisy and cluttered backgrounds, and further providing measure of their information volumes, are detailed herein using Tsallis' entropy and information and related functionals. Example use cases in radio frequency communications are given, where Wigner-Ville-based detection measures can be seen to provide significant sensitivity advantage, for some shown contexts greater than 15~dB advantage, over energy-based measures and without extensive training routines. Such an advantage is particularly significant for applications which have limitations on observation resources including time/space integration pressures and transient and/or feeble signals, where Wigner-Ville-based methods would improve sensing effectiveness by multiple orders of magnitude. The potential for advancement of several such applications is discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With great flexibility to adjust antenna positions, pinching antennas (PAs) are promising for alleviating large-scale attenuation in wireless networks. In this work, we investigate the antenna positioning and beamforming (AP-BF) design in a multi-PA multi-user system under probabilistic light-of-sight (LoS) blockage and formulate a power minimization problem subject to per-user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. For a single PA, we prove the convexity of the simplified problem and obtain its global optimum. For multiple PAs, we derive closed-form BF structures and develop an efficient first-order algorithm to achieve high-quality local solutions. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed designs and the substantial performance advantage of PA systems compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems in a term of power saving.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation via Backscatter-Aware Transmit Antenna Selection for Low-PAPR and Ultra-Reliable WSNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental physical layer conflict in hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) between high-throughput primary communication and the stringent power envelope requirements of passive backscatter sensors. We propose a Backscatter-Constrained Transmit Antenna Selection (BC-TAS) framework, a per-subcarrier selection strategy for multi-antenna illuminators operating within a Multi-Dimensional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MD-OFDM) architecture. Unlike conventional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) centric selection schemes, BC-TAS employs a multi-objective cost function that jointly maximizes desired link reliability, stabilizes the incident RF energy envelope at passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors, and suppresses interference toward coexisting victim receivers. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of MD-OFDM, the proposed framework enables dual-envelope regulation, simultaneously reducing the transmitter Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and the Backscatter Crest Factor (BCF) observed at the tag. To enhance robustness under imperfect Channel State Information (CSI), a Kalman-based channel smoothing mechanism is incorporated to maintain selection stability in low-SNR regimes. Numerical results using IEEE 802.11be dispersive channel models and a nonlinear Rapp power amplifier demonstrate that BC-TAS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in outage probability and significant gains in energy efficiency compared to conventional MU-MIMO baselines, while ensuring spectral mask compliance under reduced power amplifier back-off. These results establish BC-TAS as an effective illuminator-side control mechanism for enabling reliable and energy-stable sensing and communication coexistence in dense, power-constrained wireless environments.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Pilot and Data Payload Optimization Framework for OTFS-Based ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signal is considered a promising solution for high-mobility wireless environments. It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication.</description>

      <title>Beam-Squint-Aided Hierarchical Sensing for Integrated Sensing and Communications with Uniform Planar Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical sensing framework for wideband integrated sensing and communications with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Leveraging the beam-squint effect inherent in wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the proposed framework enables efficient two-dimensional angle estimation through a structured multi-stage sensing process. Specifically, the sensing procedure first searches over the elevation angle domain, followed by a dedicated search over the azimuth angle domain given the estimated elevation angles. In each stage, true-time-delay lines and phase shifters of the UPA are jointly configured to cover multiple grid points simultaneously across OFDM subcarriers. To enable accurate and efficient target localization, we formulate the angle estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem and develop a modified matching pursuit algorithm tailored to the hierarchical sensing architecture. Additionally, we design power allocation strategies that minimize total transmit power while meeting performance requirements for both sensing and communication. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over conventional sensing methods with reduced sensing power.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome inherent limitations of analog signals in over-the-air computation (AirComp), this letter proposes a two's complement-based coding scheme for the AirComp implementation with compatible digital modulations. Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two's complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the target of computational results, theoretically ensuring asymptotic error free computation with the minimal codeword length. To further mitigate the adverse effects of channel fading, we adopt a truncated inversion strategy for pre-processing. Benefiting from the unified symbol distribution after the proposed encoding, we derive the optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector in closed form and propose a low complexity algorithm seeking for the optimal truncation selection. Furthermore, the inherent importance differences among the coded outputs motivate an uneven power allocation strategy across subcarriers to improve computational accuracy. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing digital AirComp approaches, especially at low signal to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Joint Resource Allocation for Wireless Powered ISAC with Target Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless powered integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) faces a fundamental tradeoff between energy supply, communication throughput, and sensing accuracy. This paper investigates a wireless powered ISAC system with target localization requirements, where users harvest energy from wireless power transfer (WPT) and then conduct ISAC transmissions in a time-division manner. In addition to energy supply, the WPT signal also contributes to target sensing, and the localization accuracy is characterized by Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Under this setting, we formulate a max-min throughput maximization problem by jointly allocating the WPT duration, ISAC transmission time allocation, and transmit power. Due to the nonconvexity of the resulting problem, a suitable reformulation is developed by exploiting variable substitutions and the monotonicity of logarithmic functions, based on which an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate convergence and significant performance gains over benchmark schemes, highlighting the importance of coordinated time-power optimization in balancing sensing accuracy and communication performance in wireless powered ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>No Vision, No Wearables: 5G-based 2D Human Pose Recognition with Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing maturity of contactless human pose recognition (HPR) technology, indoor interactive applications have raised higher demands for natural, controller-free interaction methods. However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state. Experimental results demonstrate that in typical indoor environments, our proposed 5G-based ISAC HPR system significantly outperforms current mainstream baseline solutions in HPR performance, providing a solid technical foundation for universal human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits for Near-Field Sensing -- Part I: Narrow-Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) envisioned for 6G enable high-resolution sensing. However, the ELAAs worked in extremely high frequency will push operation into the near-field region, where spherical wavefronts invalidate classical far-field models and alter fundamental estimation limits. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits for Near-Field Sensing -- Part II: Wide-Band Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field sensing with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) in practical 6G systems is expected to operate over broad bandwidths, where delay, Doppler, and spatial effects become tightly coupled across frequency. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part I) is to develop the unified Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for sensing systems spanning from far-field to near-field, and narrow-band to wide-band. This paper (Part II) derives fundamental estimation limits for a wide-band near-field sensing systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signaling over a coherent processing interval. We establish an exact near-field wide-band signal model that captures frequency-dependent propagation, spherical-wave geometry, and the intrinsic coupling between target location and motion parameters across subcarriers and slow time. Similar as Part I using the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive the wide-band Fisher information matrix and the CRBs for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section, and we show how wide-band information aggregates across orthogonal subcarriers. We further develop tractable far-field and near-field approximations which provide design-level insights into the roles of bandwidth, coherent integration length, and array aperture, and clarify when wide-band effects. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and its approximations, demonstrating close agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative ranges, bandwidths, and array configurations.</description>

      <title>Overflow-Avoiding Memory AMP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) type algorithms are widely used for signal recovery in high-dimensional noisy linear systems. Recently, a principle called Memory AMP (MAMP) was proposed. Leveraging this principle, the gradient descent MAMP (GD-MAMP) algorithm was designed, inheriting the strengths of AMP and OAMP/VAMP. In this paper, we first provide an overflow-avoiding GD-MAMP (OA-GD-MAMP) to address the overflow problem that arises from some intermediate variables exceeding the range of floating point numbers. Second, we develop a complexity-reduced GD-MAMP (CR-GD-MAMP) to reduce the number of matrix-vector products per iteration by 1/3 (from 3 to 2) with little to no impact on the convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Random Modulation: Achieving Asymptotic Replica Optimality over Arbitrary Norm-Bounded and Spectrally Convergent Channel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a random modulation technique that is decoupled from the channel matrix, allowing it to be applied to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. The proposed random modulation constructs an equivalent dense and random channel matrix, ensuring that the signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. It also guarantees the asymptotic replica maximum a posteriori (MAP) bit-error rate (BER) optimality of approximate message passing (AMP)-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices when their state evolution has a unique fixed point. Then, a low-complexity cross-domain memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for random modulation, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the random transform-domain channel. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation schemes are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random-modulated linear systems, assuming the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. Numerical results show that the proposed random modulation can achieve BER and block-error rate (BLER) performance gains of up to 2 - 3 dB compared to existing OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with 5G-NR LDPC codes, under both average and optimized power allocation.</description>

      <title>Continuous Angular Power Spectrum Recovery From Channel Covariance via Chebyshev Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Chebyshev polynomial expansion framework for the recovery of a continuous angular power spectrum (APS) from channel covariance. By exploiting the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials in a transformed domain, we derive an exact series representation of the covariance and reformulate the inherently ill-posed APS inversion as a finite-dimensional linear regression problem via truncation. The associated approximation error is directly controlled by the tail of the APS's Chebyshev series and decays rapidly with increasing angular smoothness. Building on this representation, we derive an exact semidefinite characterization of nonnegative APS and introduce a derivative-based regularizer that promotes smoothly varying APS profiles while preserving transitions of clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed Chebyshev-based framework yields accurate APS reconstruction, and enables reliable downlink (DL) covariance prediction from uplink (UL) measurements in a frequency division duplex (FDD) setting. These findings indicate that jointly exploiting smoothness and nonnegativity in a Chebyshev domain provides an effective tool for covariance-domain processing in multi-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Random Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.</description>

      <title>CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Decentralized No-Regret Frequency-Time Scheduling for FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars are indispensable to modern ADAS and autonomous-driving systems, but their increasing density has intensified the risk of mutual interference. Existing mitigation techniques, including reactive receiver-side suppression, proactive waveform design, and cooperative scheduling, often face limitations in scalability, reliance on side-channel communication, or degradation of range-Doppler resolution. Building on our earlier work on decentralized Frequency-Domain No-Regret hopping, this paper introduces a unified time-frequency game-theoretic framework that enables radars to adapt across both spectral and temporal resources. We formulate the interference-avoidance problem as a repeated anti-coordination game, in which each radar autonomously updates a mixed strategy over frequency subbands and chirp-level time offsets using regret-minimization dynamics. We show that the proposed Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping algorithm achieves vanishing external and swap regret, and that the induced empirical play converges to an $\varepsilon$-coarse correlated equilibrium or a correlated equilibrium. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds in the joint domain, revealing how temporal adaptation implicitly regularizes frequency selection and enhances robustness against asynchronous interference. Numerical experiments with multi-radar scenarios demonstrate substantial improvements in SINR, collision rate, and range-Doppler quality compared with time-frequency random hopping and centralized Nash-based benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis under unseen working conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

      <title>Throughput Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS under Jittering and Imperfect CSI via DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can reshape wireless propagation on-demand. However, their performance is sensitive to UAV jitter and cascaded channel uncertainty. This paper investigates a downlink multiple-input single-output UAV-mounted RIS system in which a ground multiple-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users under practical impairments. Our goal is to maximize the expected throughput under stochastic three-dimensional UAV jitter and imperfect cascaded channel state information (CSI) based only on the available channel estimates. This leads to a stochastic nonconvex optimization problem subject to a BS transmit power constraint and strict unit-modulus constraints on all RIS elements. To address this problem, we design a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with a contextual bandit formulation. A differentiable feasibility layer is utilized to map continuous actions to feasible solutions, while the reward is a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected throughput. We instantiate this framework with constrained variants of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) that do not use target networks. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms yield higher throughput than conventional alternating optimization-based weighted minimum mean-square error (AO-WMMSE) baselines under severe jitter and low CSI quality. Across different scenarios, the proposed methods achieve performance that is either comparable to or slightly below the AO-WMMSE benchmark, based on sample average approximation (SAA) with a relative gap ranging from 0-12%. Moreover, the proposed DRL controllers achieve online inference times of 0.6 ms per decision versus roughly 370-550 ms for AO-WMMSE solvers.</description>

      <title>Sidelink Positioning: Standardization Advancements, Challenges and Opportunities</title>

Abstract: With the integration of cellular networks in vertical industries that demand precise location information, such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), public safety, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), positioning has become an imperative component for future wireless networks. By exploiting a wider spectrum, multiple antennas and flexible architectures, cellular positioning achieves ever-increasing positioning accuracy. Still, it faces fundamental performance degradation when the distance between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) is large or in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. To this end, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18 proposes to standardize sidelink (SL) positioning, which provides unique opportunities to extend the positioning coverage via direct positioning signaling between UEs. Despite the standardization advancements, the capability of SL positioning is controversial, especially how much spectrum is required to achieve the positioning accuracy defined in 3GPP. To this end, this article summarizes the latest standardization advancements of 3GPP on SL positioning comprehensively, covering a) network architecture; b) positioning types; and c) performance requirements. The capability of SL positioning using various positioning methods under different imperfect factors is evaluated and discussed in-depth. Finally, according to the evolution of SL in 3GPP Rel-19, we discuss the possible research directions and challenges of SL positioning.</description>

      <title>A Close Examination of the Multipath Propagation Stochastic Model for Communications over Power Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the parameterization of the multipath propagation model (MPM) for indoor broadband power line communications (PLC), which up to now has been established in an heuristic way. The MPM model was initially proposed in the PLC context for outdoor channels in the band up to 20 MHz, but its number of parameters becomes extremely large when used to model indoor channel frequency responses (CFR), which are much more frequency-selective than outdoor ones, and the band is extended to 80 MHz. This work proposes a fitting procedure that addresses this problem. It allows determining the model parameters that yield the best fit to each channel of a large database of single-input single-output (SISO) experimental measurements acquired in typical home premises of different European countries. Then, the statistics of the MPM parameters are analyzed. The study unveils the relation between the model parameters and the main characteristics of the actual CFR like the frequency selectivity and the average attenuation. It also estimates the probability density function (PDF) of each parameter and proposes a fitting distribution for each of them. Moreover, the relationship among the main parameters of the model, as well as their impact on the performance of PLC communication systems are also explored. Provided results can be helpful for the development of MPM-based models for indoor broadband PLC.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on MIMO-OFDM ISAC: From Far-Field to Near-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the key usage scenarios for future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, where communication and sensing (C&amp;S) services are simultaneously provided through shared wireless spectrum, signal processing modules, hardware, and network infrastructure. Such an integration is strengthened by the technology trends in 6G, such as denser network nodes, larger antenna arrays, wider bandwidths, higher frequency bands, and more efficient utilization of spectrum and hardware resources, which incentivize and empower enhanced sensing capabilities. As the dominant waveform used in contemporary communication systems, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is still expected to be a very competitive technology for 6G, rendering it necessary to thoroughly investigate the potential and challenges of OFDM ISAC. Thus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of ISAC systems enabled by large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and OFDM technologies and to discuss their fundamental principles, advantages, and enabling signal processing methods. To this end, a unified MIMO-OFDM ISAC system model is first introduced, followed by four frameworks for estimating parameters across the spatial, delay, and Doppler domains, including parallel one-domain, sequential one-domain, joint two-domain, and joint three-domain parameter estimation. Next, sensing algorithms and performance analyses are presented in detail for far-field scenarios where uniform plane wave (UPW) propagation is valid, followed by their extensions to near-field scenarios where uniform spherical wave (USW) characteristics need to be considered. Finally, this paper points out open challenges and outlines promising avenues for future research on MIMO-OFDM ISAC.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Nonlinear Mixed-Integer Location Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For three decades, carrier-phase observations have been used to obtain the most accurate location estimates using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). These estimates are computed by minimizing a nonlinear mixed-integer least-squares problem. Existing algorithms linearize the problem, orthogonally project it to eliminate real variables, and then solve the integer least-square problem. There is now considerable interest in developing similar localization techniques for terrestrial and indoor settings. We show that algorithms that linearize first fail in these settings and we propose several algorithms for computing the estimates. Some of our algorithms are elimination algorithms that start by eliminating the non-linear terms in the constraints; others construct a geometric arrangement that allows us to efficiently enumerate integer solutions (in polynomial time). We focus on simplified localization problems in which the measurements are range (distance) measurements and carrier phase range measurements, with no nuisance parameters. The simplified problem allows us to focus on the core question of untangling the nonlinearity and the integer nature of some parameters. We show using simulations that the new algorithms are effective at close ranges at which the linearize-first approach fails.</description>

      <title>Frequency-switching Array Enhanced Physical-Layer Security in Terahertz Bands: A Movable Antenna Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new frequency-switching array (FSA) to enhance the physical-layer security (PLS) in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), where the carrier frequency can be flexibly switched and small frequency offsets can be imposed on each antenna at the secrecy transmitter (Alice).First, we analytically show that by flexibly controlling the carrier frequency parameters, FSAs can effectively form uniform/non-uniform sparse arrays, hence resembling existing mechanically controlled movable antennas (MAs) via the control of inter-antenna spacing and providing additional degree-of-freedom in the beam manipulation.Although the proposed FSA suffers from additional path-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware and signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning accuracy, extra hardware and energy cost.Then, a secrecy-rate maximization problem is formulated under the constraints on the frequency control.To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem with a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission beamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform frequency increment.Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed FSA can flexibly realize null-steering over Eve in both the angular domain and range domain, thereby achieving improved PLS performance.Then, for the general case, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem by using the block coordinate descent and projected gradient ascent techniques. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FSA achieves superior secrecy rate performance over conventional fixed-position array, while it only suffers a slight secrecy rate loss than the existing mechanically controlled MA.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Detector for Faulty GNSS Measurements Detection With Non-Gaussian Noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault detection is crucial to ensure the reliability of navigation systems. However, mainstream fault detection methods are developed based on Gaussian assumptions on nominal errors, while current attempts at non-Gaussian fault detection are either heuristic or lack rigorous statistical properties. The performance and reliability of these methods are challenged in real-world applications. This paper proposes the jackknife detector, a fault detection method tailored for linearized pseudorange-based positioning systems under non-Gaussian nominal errors. Specifically, by leveraging the jackknife technique, a test statistic is derived as a linear combination of measurement errors, eliminating the need for restrictive distributional assumptions while maintaining computational efficiency. A hypothesis test with the Bonferroni correction is then constructed to detect potential faults in measurements. Theoretical analysis proves the equivalence between the jackknife detector and the solution separation (SS) detector, while revealing the former's superior computational efficiency. Through a worldwide simulation and a real-world satellite clock anomaly detection experiment--both involving non-Gaussian nominal errors--the proposed jackknife detector demonstrates equivalent detection performance to the SS detector but achieves a fourfold improvement in computational efficiency. These results highlight the jackknife detector's substantial potential for real-time applications requiring robust and efficient fault detection in non-Gaussian noise environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Artifacts Removal for Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation and a Temporal Event Localization Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) leverages symptom-related biomarkers to deliver personalized neuromodulation therapy, with the potential to improve treatment efficacy and reduce power consumption compared to conventional DBS. However, stimulation-induced signal contamination remains a major technical barrier to advancing its clinical application. Existing artifact removal strategies, both front-end and back-end, face trade-offs between artifact suppression and algorithmic flexibility. Among back-end algorithms, Shrinkage and Manifold-based Artifact Removal using Template Adaptation (SMARTA) has shown promising performance in mitigating stimulus artifacts with minimal distortion to local field potentials (LFPs), but its high computational demand and inability to handle transient direct current (DC) artifacts limit its use in real-time applications. To address this, we developed SMARTA+, a computationally efficient extension of SMARTA capable of suppressing both stimulus and transient DC artifacts while supporting flexible algorithmic design. We evaluated SMARTA+ using semi-real aDBS data and real data from Parkinson's disease patients. Compared to SMARTA and other established methods, SMARTA+ achieved comparable or superior artifact removal while significantly reducing computation time. It preserved spectral and temporal structures, ranging from beta band to high-frequency oscillations, and demonstrated robustness across diverse stimulation protocols. Temporal event localization analysis further showed improved accuracy in detecting beta bursts. These findings support SMARTA+ as a promising tool for advancing real-time, closed-loop aDBS systems.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna Systems for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the pinching antenna system (PASS) has attracted considerable attention due to their advantages in flexible deployment and reduction of signal propagation loss. In this work, a multiple waveguide PASS assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is proposed, where the base station (BS) is equipped with transmitting pinching antennas (PAs) and receiving uniform linear array (ULA) antennas. The full-duplex (FD) BS transmits the communication and sensing signals through the PAs on waveguides and collects the echo sensing signals with the mounted ULA. Based on this configuration, a target sensing Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) minimization problem is formulated under communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, power budget constraint, and PA deployment constraints. The alternating optimization (AO) method is employed to address the formulated non-convex optimization problem. In each iteration, the overall optimization problem is decomposed into a digital beamforming sub-problem and a pinching beamforming sub-problem. The sensing covariance matrix and communication beamforming matrix at the BS are optimized by solving the digital beamforming sub-problem with semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The PA deployment is updated by solving the pinching beamforming sub-problem with the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, penalty method, and element-wise optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed PASS assisted ISAC framework achieves superior performance over benchmark schemes, is less affected by stringent communication constraints compared to conventional MIMO-ISAC, and benefits further from increasing the number of waveguides and PAs per waveguide.</description>

      <title>Dual-IRS Aided Near-/Hybrid-Field SWIPT: Passive Beamforming and Independent Antenna Power Splitting Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dual-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided interference-limited simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with independent power splitting (PS), where each receiving antenna applies different PS factors to offer an advantageous trade-off between the useful information and harvested energy. We separately establish the near- and hybrid-field channel models for IRS-reflected links to evaluate the performance gain more precisely and practically. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the harvested power by jointly optimizing dual-IRS phase shifts, independent PS ratio, and receive beamforming vector in both near- and hybrid-field cases. In the near-field case, the alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by applying the Lagrange duality method and the difference-of-convex (DC) programming. In the hybrid-field case, we first present an interesting result that the AP-IRS-user channel gains are invariant to the phase shifts of dual-IRS, which allows the optimization problem to be transformed into a convex one. Then, we derive the asymptotic performance of the combined channel gains in closed-form and analyze the characteristics of the dual-IRS. Numerical results validate our analysis and indicate the performance gains of the proposed scheme that dual-IRS-aided SWIPT with independent PS over other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Time-Modulated Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Integrated Sensing, Communication and Security: A Generative AI Design Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to achieve physical layer security for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating in the presence of targets that may be eavesdroppers. The system is aided by a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS), which is configured to preserve the integrity of the transmitted data at one or more legitimate communication users (CUs) while making them appear scrambled in all other directions. The TM-IRS design leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) framework to learn a stochastic policy that samples high-performing TM-IRS configurations from a vast discrete parameter space. Specifically, we begin by formulating the achievable sum rate for the legitimate CUs and the beampattern gain toward the target direction, based on which we construct reward functions for GFlowNets that jointly capture both communication and sensing performance. The TM-IRS design is modeled as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state corresponds to a complete configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets, parametrized by deep neural networks are employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their associated reward. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GFlowNet-based method in integrating sensing, communication and security simultaneously, and also exhibit significant sampling efficiency as compared to the exhaustive combinatorial search and enhanced robustness against the existing benchmarks of physical layer security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated optimization method for ray path tracing in environments containing planar reflectors and straight diffraction edges. Based on Fermat's principle, our approach reformulates the path-finding problem as the minimization of total path length, enabling efficient parallel execution on modern GPU architectures. Unlike existing methods that require separate algorithms for reflections and diffractions, our unified formulation maintains consistent problem dimensions across all interaction sequences, making it particularly suitable for vectorized computation. Through implicit differentiation, we achieve efficient gradient computation without differentiating through solver iterations, significantly outperforming traditional automatic differentiation approaches. Numerical simulations demonstrate convergence rates comparable to specialized Newton methods while providing superior scalability for large-scale applications. The method integrates seamlessly with differentiable programming libraries such as JAX and DrJIT, enabling new possibilities in inverse design and optimization for wireless propagation modeling.

      <title>Simultaneous Source Separation, Synchronization, Localization and Mapping for 6G Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach for future 6G networks to jointly estimate the positions of transmitters and receivers together with the propagation environment. In cooperative MP-SLAM, information collected by multiple mobile terminals (MTs) is fused to enhance accuracy and robustness. Existing methods, however, typically assume perfectly synchronized base stations (BSs) and orthogonal transmission sequences, rendering inter-BS interference at the MTs negligible. In this work, we relax these assumptions and address simultaneous source separation, synchronization, and mapping. A relevant example arises in modern 5G systems, where BSs employ muting patterns to mitigate interference, yet localization performance still degrades. We propose a novel BS-dependent data association and synchronization bias model, integrated into a joint Bayesian framework and inferred via the sum-product algorithm on a factor graph. The impact of joint synchronization and source separation is analyzed under various system configurations. Compared with state-of-the-art cooperative MP-SLAM assuming orthogonal and synchronized BSs, our statistical analysis shows no significant performance degradation. The proposed BS-dependent data association model constitutes a principled approach for classifying features by arbitrary properties, such as reflection order or feature type (scatterers versus walls).</description>

      <title>The Power of Preconditioning in Overparameterized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$, a preconditioned gradient descent method to tackle the low-rank matrix sensing problem when the true rank is unknown, and when the matrix is possibly ill-conditioned. Using overparametrized factor representations, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ starts from a small random initialization, and proceeds by gradient descent with a specific form of damped preconditioning to combat bad curvatures induced by overparameterization and ill-conditioning. At the expense of light computational overhead incurred by preconditioners, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent ($\textsf{GD}$) even with overprameterization. Specifically, we show that, under the Gaussian design, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ converges to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate after a small number of iterations that scales only logarithmically with respect to the condition number and the problem dimension. This significantly improves over the convergence rate of vanilla $\textsf{GD}$ which suffers from a polynomial dependency on the condition number. Our work provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in accelerating the convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized learning.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Users in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Stream Allocation and Necessity of Downlink Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple antennas on the users and access points (APs). In previous works, the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) has been evaluated using the hardening bound that requires no downlink pilots. This approach works well for single-antenna users. In this paper, we show that much higher SEs can be achieved if downlink pilots are sent when having multi-antenna users. The reason is that the effective channel matrix does not harden. We propose a pilot-based downlink estimation scheme, derive a new SE expression, and show numerically that it yields substantially higher performance when having correlated Rayleigh fading channels.
  In cases with multi-antenna users, the APs can either transmit the same or different data streams. The latter reduces the fronthaul signaling but comes with a SE loss. We propose precoding and combining schemes for these cases and consider whether channel knowledge is shared between the APs. Finally, we show numerically how the number of users, APs, and the number of antennas on users and APs affect the SE.</description>
