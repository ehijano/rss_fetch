      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Origin of the insulating state in the Kitaev candidate Cu$_2$IrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a combination of crystal symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations we unveil a possible microscopic origin of the unexpected insulating behavior reported in the honeycomb Kitaev material Cu$_2$IrO$_3$. Our study suggests that this material hosts an instability towards charge ordering of the Ir ions, with alternating magnetic Ir$^{4+}$ and non-magnetic Ir$^{3+}$ ions arranged on the honeycomb lattice. In this case, the next-nearest-neighbor interactions that couple magnetic Ir$^{4+}$ ions form an enlarged triangular lattice, instead of the expected honeycomb lattice. The magnetic Cu$^{2+}$ ions located at the centre of the iridium honeycomb voids also form a triangular lattice, and additionally contribute to the magnetization of the system. Together, the interpenetrated Ir$^{4+}$ and Cu$^{2+}$ triangular lattices present a novel type of honeycomb Kitaev lattice composed of two types of magnetic ions.</description>

      <title>Collective quantum phases in frustrated arrays of Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collective quantum phases and quantum phase transitions occurring in frustrated sawtooth arrays of small quantum Josephson junctions. Frustration is introduced through the periodic arrangement of $0$- and $\pi$- Josephson junctions with the Josephson coupling energies $\alpha E_\mathrm{J}$ of different signs, $-1\leq \alpha \leq 1$. The complexity of the potential landscape of the system is controlled by the frustration parameter $f=(1-\alpha)/2$. The potential energy has a single global minimum in the non-frustrated regime ($f&lt;f_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$) and a macroscopic number of equal minima in the frustrated regime ($f&gt;f_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$). We address the coherent quantum regime and identify several collective quantum phases: disordered (insulating) and ordered (superconducting) phases in the non-frustrated regime, as well as highly entangled patterns of vortices and anti-vortices in the frustrated regime. These collective quantum phases are controlled by several physical parameters: the frustration $f$, the Josephson coupling, and the charging energies of junctions and islands. We map the control parameter phase diagram by characterizing the quantum dynamics of frustrated Josephson junction arrays by spatially and temporally resolved quantum-mechanical correlation function of the local magnetization.</description>

      <title>Solving and visualizing fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions with neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to variationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in magnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working directly with the full Hilbert space of $N$ electrons confined to a disk, our FNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization (ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL mixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance behavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and strong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a phase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL mixing. Our study demonstrates unprecedented power and universality of FNN based variational method for solving strong-coupling many-body problems with topological order and electron fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Many-body multipole indices revealed by the real-space dynamical mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multipole moments are fundamental properties of insulators, and have attracted lots of attention with emerging of the higher-order topological insulators. A couple of ways, including generalization of the formula for the polarization and the Wilson loop, have been proposed to calculate it in real materials. However, a practical method to explore it in correlated insulators is still lacking. Here, we proposed a systematic way, which combines the general Green's function formula for multiopoles with the real-space dynamical mean-field theory, to calculate the multipole moments in correlated materials. Our demonstrating calculations are consistent with symmetry analysis, and the calculations of the spectral functions further confirm our results. This method opens the new avenue to study the topological phase transitions in correlated multipole insulators and other crucial physical quantities closely related to multipole moments.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement entropy and Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to liquid transition in biquadratic spin-1 XY chain with rhombic single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are investigated in biquadratic spin-$1$ XY chain with rhombic single-ion anisotropy by using the ground state energy (GE), the bipartite entanglement entropy (BEE), and the mutual information (MI). It turns out that there are three spin nematic phases and two Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid phases with the central charge $c = 1$. The TL Liquid phases emerge roughly for biquadratic interaction strength two times stronger than the absolute value of the single-ion anisotropy. The GE and the derivatives up to the second order reveal a first-order QPT between spin nematic ferroquarupole (FQ) phases but cannot capture an evident signal of QPTs between the spin nematic phases and the TL Liquid phases as well as QPT between the two TL liquid phases. The TL liquid-to-liquid transition point features a highly degenerate state and the spin-block entanglement entropy increases logarithmically with block size. The BEE exhibits a divergent or convergent behavior identifying the TL Liquid or spin nematic FQ phases, respectively. Similarly, the MI and the spin-spin correlation are shown to decay algebraically or exponentially with increasing the lattice distance in the TL Liquid or spin nematic FQ phases, respectively. In the TL liquid phase, the exponents $\eta_I$ and $\eta_z$ of the MI and the spin-spin correlation vary with the interaction parameter of the biquadratic interaction strength and the rhombic single-ion anisotropy and satisfy the relationship of $\eta_z &lt;\eta_I$. Such changes of characteristic behavior of the BEE, the MI and the spin-spin correlation indicate an occurrence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-type QPT between the TL Liquid phase and the spin nematic FQ phase. The staggered spin fluctuation $\langle S^x S^y \rangle$ is shown to play a significant role for the emergence of the TL liquid phase and thus give rise to the BKT-type QPT.</description>

      <title>Theory of rare-earth Kramers magnets on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice: dimer phases in presence of strong spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase that appears near the Heisenberg limit, some peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable with dispersive quantum excitations. We discuss how to distinguish the singlet and triplet dimer phases in experiments, and discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ and Er$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the formalism of patch bosonization of Fermi surfaces, with a focus on the problem of a two-dimensional metal at a quantum critical point. I argue that this formalism is fundamentally inapplicable to the problem, except in synthetic limits. One such limit is the small-$N$ limit, which was already discussed in early studies of the problem; a similar but slightly less unphysical large-$N$ limit is proposed. I show that it is at least formally possible to construct perturbative expansions around these synthetic limits. However, I argue that nonperturbative effects become important when $N\sim1$.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotons in Moir\'e Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the intraband neutral excitations in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) within moir\'e flatband systems, particularly focusing on the twisted transition metal dichalocogenide homobilayers. Our work provides a detailed description of the magnetorotons in FCIs utilizing exact diagonalization. We further explore the nature of the geometrical excitations in the long-wavelength limit, identifying chiral angular momentum-2 features. Additionally, we find that these modes exhibit chiral mixing and become unstable as the FCI deviates from its ideal conditions. Interestingly, we find evidence of the nonchiral geometrical excitations in the charge density wave (CDW), demonstrating that the geometrical excitations might be supported even in the absence of topology. Our work sheds light on the profound interplay between geometry and topology from the perspectives of excitations.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations in epitaxial graphene: Mott states proximitized to a relativistic electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene, renowned for its exceptional electronic and optical properties as a robust 2D material, traditionally lacks electronic correlation effects. Proximity coupling offers a promising method to endow quantum materials with novel properties. In this study, we achieve such a proximity coupling by intercalating Sn between the buffer layer of graphene on SiC(0001), allowing us to explore the coupling between a correlated 2D electron gas and a Dirac metal. This results in the stabilization of Sn-$\sqrt{3}$ superlattice structures at the interface, which reveal Mott-Hubbard bands, in excellent agreement with both experimental observations and theoretical predictions. Additionally, we found signatures of quasiparticle peaks close to the Fermi energy, in detail depending on the hybridization strength and doping level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study charge-exchange dynamics between slow atomic particles and condensed matter revealing a strong dependence of the mean charge state on particle trajectory. Exploiting transmission geometries, single crystalline targets and distributions of the interaction distances obtained in simulations, we show the differences being rooted in the interaction with inner-shell electrons despite the low ion energy. Energy dissipation due to deexcitation of modified inner shell states as well as increased local ionization density due to altered mean charge states aggregate the excessive energy deposition in amorphous targets compared to channeling trajectories and ab-initio calculations.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significant challenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application during the decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{\hat{O}} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{\hat{O}e^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture the complex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which provides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Non-chiral 1T-TiSe2 creates circular dichroism in resonant X-ray diffraction via multipole scattering interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant X-ray diffraction (RXD) provides a unique capability to investigate electronically ordered states in matter. Importantly, circular dichroism in RXD can determine the absolute chirality formed by anisotropic multipole arrangement. Here, we demonstrate that the scattering interference between distinct atomic electric multipoles can create circular contrast in resonant RXD even in a non-chiral crystal. These general considerations are applied to 1T-TiSe2, where recently reported circular dichroism in RXD was used to claim a chiral charge density wave order. We show that the experimental observations are well reproduced by our ab initio calculations based on the centrosymmetric crystal structure. Our results not only illuminate a way for a better understanding of possible chiral electronic order but also propose a general approach to extract buried high-order atomic multipoles via circular contrast in RXD. Besides, we discuss the difference in the circular dichroism of RXD originated by crystal chirality in chiral crystals and the interference effect in non-chiral crystals.</description>

      <title>Anomalous enhancement of Neel order in the $S = 1/2$ square lattice Heisenberg model under fictitious magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fictitious magnetic fields can be introduced in quantum magnets by the strain engineering and the Aharonov-Casher effect. Here, we study impacts of a uniform fictitious magnetic field and corresponding Landau quantization on the Neel order in the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice as a prototypical system of quantum magnets. We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave approximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the fictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect to the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix renormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account and obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be anomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation induced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of correlated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.</description>

Abstract: The quantum loop model (QLM), along with the quantum dimer model (QDM), are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, these models are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg quantum simulators. However, the effect of finite temperature fluctuations on these quantum constrained models has been barely explored. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite temperature phase diagram of the QLM on the triangular lattice. We discover that the vison plaquette (VP) crystal experiences a finite temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase.</description>

      <title>The dynamical enhancement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in lattice Anderson impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new route to generate an interband Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in metals from solely microscopic perspective. The system consists of conduction band electrons in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling which are coupled to a $f(d)$-type localized and interacting electrons. The double occupancy in the $f$-band is penalized by a significant Coulomb interaction energy, $U$. When the hybridization between two bands is not strictly local, it leads an alternative pathway to a spin Hamiltonian that may proliferate the formation of Skyrmion textures. The effective spin Hamiltonian is derived using the Schriffer-Wolff perturbation theory. In addition to a Kondo spin exchange interaction between conduction band spins and $f(d)$-band spins, which is denoted as $\vec{s}_m \cdot \vec{S}_n$, the spin Hamiltonian admits a {\bf Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya} spin coupling term, $\vec{s}_m \times \vec{S}_n$. The magnitude of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term is approximately ten to hundred times smaller than that of the Kondo term under physically relevant assumptions.
  The magnitude of spin coupling terms can be engineered using time-dependent external fields, motivating a generalization to a effective time-dependent Hamiltonian. In this respect, the perturbative derivation is extended to include time-dependent external field using a time-dependent SW transformation. The form of the effective spin Hamiltonian is retained while the spin coupling coefficients gain time dependence. It has been shown that the DM term acquires a new energy scale, which leads to an enhancement of one to two orders of magnitude and makes it comparable to the Kondo coupling.</description>

      <title>Defect-induced spin textures in magnetic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin textures induced by nonmagnetic vacancies in classical noncollinear magnets. By developing an "elasticity theory" for spin systems, we show that a defect-induced spin readjustment decays with a power law at large distances. The power-law exponent depends on the multipole moment of the local spin deformation, which is in turn determined by both the lattice symmetry and the equilibrium spin configuration in the absence of a defect. The interplay of these two ingredients is best illustrated by the J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice for which a point vacancy may produce spin deformations that decay as 1/r^2 for the q=0 ground state and as a 1/r for the \sqrt{3} x \sqrt{3} magnetic structure. The analytic conclusions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. We also compute the fractional magnetic moments associated with vacancies and other lattice defects. Our results shed light on relative fragility of different magnetic structures with respect to spin glass formation at higher doping levels.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Markov length: a diagnostic for fault tolerance via mixed-state phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the fault-tolerance of local stabilizer codes experiencing measurement and physical errors and the mixed-state phases of decohered resource states in one higher dimension. Drawing from recent developments in mixed-state phases of matter, this motivates a diagnostic of fault-tolerance, which we refer to as the spacetime Markov length. This is a length scale determined by the decay of the (classical) conditional mutual information of repeated syndrome measurement outcomes in spacetime. The diagnostic is independent of the decoder, and its divergence signals the intrinsic breakdown of fault tolerance. As a byproduct, we find that decoherence may be useful for exposing transitions from higher-form symmetry-protected topological phases driven by both incoherent and coherent perturbations.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the phase transition of the massive Thirring model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum computing technology has made it possible to study the thermodynamic properties of fermionic systems at finite temperatures through quantum simulations on a quantum computer. This provides a novel approach to the study of the chiral phase transition of fermionic systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states (QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into L parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. We show that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a fractal multipartite decomposition: it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction. Building upon this result, we then build exact, analytical tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of generalized Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and universality in stationary state of long-range Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the signature of quantum criticality in the long-time stationary state of the long-range Kitaev chain by performing various quench protocols. In this model, the pairing interaction decays with distance according to a power law with exponent $\alpha$. Using quantum information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and logarithmic negativity, we show that, irrespective of the values of $\alpha$, critical-to-critical quench displays quantum criticality even in the stationary state. Remarkably, in the presence of long-range pairing interactions, where fermionic correlators decay algebraically even at non-critical points, signature of quantum criticality persists in the stationary state. Furthermore, the effective central charge, calculated from both mutual information and logarithmic negativity of stationary state following a critical-to-critical quench, agrees with the central charge of the corresponding ground states for both $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 2$. Therefore, information of the universality class can be inferred from the stationary state.</description>

      <title>Light-induced hysteresis of electronic polarization in antiferromagnet FePS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on manipulating materials using light has garnered significant interest, yet examples of controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate the hysteresis of electronic polarization in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor FePS3 via light. Below the N\'eel temperature, we observe linear dichroism (i.e., optical anisotropy) without structural symmetry breaking. Light-induced net polarization aligns along the a-axis (zigzag direction) at 1.6 eV due to the dipolar polarization and along the b-axis (armchair direction) at 2.0 eV due to the combined effects of dipolar and octupolar polarizations, resulting from charge transfer from the armchair to the zigzag direction by light. Unexpected hysteresis of the electronic polarization occurs at 2.0 eV due to the octupolar polarization, in contrast to the absence of such hysteresis at 1.6 eV. We attribute this to a symmetry breaking of the light-induced phase of FePS3 involving electronic polarization within the spin lattice. This study suggests a new mechanism for generating and controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials using light, with implications for future device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. It is an example of a correlated hopping model in which chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter in the anyon-Hubbard model and we find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard pattern in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Transition-Induced Colossal Magnetoresistance in the Ferrimagnetic Semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is observed only when a magnetic field is applied along the magnetic hard axis ($\mathbf{H}\parallel c$). This phenomenon suggests an unconventional CMR mechanism potentially driven by the interplay between magnetism, topological band structure, and/or chiral orbital currents (COC). By comparing electrical resistance measurements using continuous direct currents and pulse currents, we found that the current-induced insulator-metal transition, supporting the COC-driven CMR mechanism, is likely a consequence of Joule heating effects. Additionally, multiple magnetic field-induced metamagnetic transitions were identified through AC magnetostriction coefficient experiments, but only when $\mathbf{H}\parallel c$. Importantly, the transition at $\sim$ 5 T marks the boundary between the low-field CMR and high-field weak MR. These findings suggest that field-induced metamagnetic transition combined with partial polarization of magnetic moments are the primary causes of the band gap closure, leading to the observed CMR in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$.</description>

      <title>Superposing and gauging fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair states to get lattice gauge theory groundstates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) form a novel type of Ansatz state for the groundstate of lattice gauge theories. The advantage of these states is that they allow efficient calculation of observables by combining Monte-Carlo integration over gauge fields configurations with Gaussian tensor network machinery for the fermionic part. Remarkably, for GGFPEPS the probability distribution for the gauge field configurations is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem.
  In this work we will demonstrate that gauged (non-Gaussian) fermionic projected pair states (GFPEPS) exactly capture the groundstate of generic lattice gauge theories. Additionally, we will present a framework for the efficient computation of observables in the case where the non-Gaussianity of the PEPS follows from the superposition of (few) Gaussian PEPS.
  Finally, we present a new graphical notation for Gaussian tensor and their contractions into Gaussian tensor network states.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram, $d$-Wave Superconductivity, and Pseudogap of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06322v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) order has been unveiled in the ground state of the 2D $t$-$t'$-$J$ model -- with both nearest-neighbor ($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings -- by density matrix renormalization group studies. However, there is currently a debate on whether the $d$-wave SC holds up strong on both $t'/t&gt;0$ and $t'/t&lt;0$ cases for the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which correspond to the electron- and hole-doped sides of the cuprate phase diagram, respectively. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach to accurately obtain the phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on cylinders with widths up to $W=6$ and down to low temperature as $T/J \simeq 0.06$, pushing the boundaries of contemporary finite-$T$ calculations. For $t'/t&gt;0$, we find a dome-like SC regime with a diverging $d$-wave pairing susceptibility, $\chi_\textrm{SC} \propto 1/T^\alpha$ below a characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Near optimal doping, $T_c^*$ reaches its highest value of about $0.15 J$. Above $T_c^*$ yet below a higher crossover temperature $T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility becomes suppressed, which can be related to the onset of pseudogap (PG) behaviors. On the other hand, for $t'/t&lt;0$ we find the pairing correlations are much weaker, although there exhibits a node-antinode structure in the PG regime as observed in the hole-doped cuprates. The thermal tensor network calculations of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model underscore both the similarities and differences in the finite-temperature phase diagram between the fundamental model and cuprates, yielding unique insights into their intricate behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Bound on Thermalization from Diffusive Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local equilibration time of quantum many-body systems has been conjectured to satisfy a `Planckian bound', $\tau_{\rm eq}\gtrsim \frac{\hbar}{T}$. We provide a sharp and universal definition of this time scale, and show that it is bounded below by the strong coupling scale of diffusive fluctuations, which can be expressed in terms of familiar transport parameters. When applied to quantum field theories at finite temperature, this fluctuation bound implies the Planckian bound. The fluctuation bound moreover applies to any local thermalizing system, and we study its implication for correlated insulators, metals, as well as disordered fixed points, where it can be used to establish a lower bound on the diffusivity in terms of the specific heat $D\gtrsim 1/(c_V^{2/d}\tau_{\rm eq})$. Finally, we discuss how the local equilibration time can be directly measured in experiments.</description>

      <title>Fermi Liquid near a q=0 Charge Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the quasiparticle interaction function (the fully dressed and antisymmetrized interaction between fermions) for a two-dimensional Fermi liquid at zero temperature close to a q=0 charge quantum critical point (QCP) in the $s-$wave channel (the one leading to phase separation). By the Ward identities, this vertex function must be related to quasiparticle residue $Z$, which can be obtained independently from the fermionic self-energy. We show that to satisfy these Ward identities, one needs to go beyond the standard diagrammatic formulation of Fermi-liquid theory and include series of additional contributions to the vertex function. These contributions are not present in a conventional Fermi liquid, but do emerge near a QCP, where the effective 4-fermion interaction is mediated by a soft dynamical boson. We demonstrate explicitly that including these terms restores the Ward identity. Our analysis is built on previous studies of the vertex function near an antiferromagnetic QCP [Phys. Rev. B 89, 045108 (2014)] and a d-wave charge-nematic QCP [Phys. Rev. B 81, 045110 (2010)]. We show that for $s-$wave charge QCP the analysis is more straightforward and allows one to obtain the full quasiparticle interaction function (the Landau function) near a QCP. We show that all partial components of this function (Landau parameters) diverge near a QCP, in the same way as the effective mass $m^*$, except for the $s$-wave charge component, which approaches $-1$. Consequently, the susceptibilities in all channels, except for the critical one, remain finite at a QCP, as they should.</description>

Abstract: Understanding competing charge density wave (CDW) orders in the bilayer kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ remains challenging. Experimentally, upon cooling, short-range order with wave vector $\mathbf{q}_{2}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ forms, which is subsequently suppressed by the condensation of long-range $\mathbf{q}_{3}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ CDW order at lower temperature. Theoretically, however, the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW is predicted as the ground state, leaving the CDW mechanism elusive. Here, using anharmonic phonon-phonon calculations combined with density functional theory, we predict a temperature-driven structural phase transitions from the high-temperature pristine phase to the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW, followed by the low-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW, explaining experimental observations. We demonstrate that semi-core electron states stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW over the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW. Furthermore, we find that the out-of-plane lattice parameter controls the competing CDWs, motivating us to propose compressive bi-axial strain as an experimental protocol to stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW. Finally, we suggest Ge or Pb doping at the Sn site as another potential avenue to control CDW instabilities. Our work provides a full theory of CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, rationalizing experimental observations and resolving earlier discrepancies between theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas</title>

Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.</description>

Abstract: X-ray spectroscopy has been a key method to determine ground and excited state properties of quantum materials with atomic specificity. Now, new x-ray facilities are opening the door to the study of pump-probe x-ray spectroscopy - specifically time-resolved x-ray absorption (trXAS) and time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (trRIXS). In this paper we will present simulations of each of these spectroscopies using a time-domain full atomic multiplet, charge transfer Hamiltonian, adapted to study the properties of a generalized cluster model including a central transition metal ion caged by ligand atoms in a planar geometry. The numerically evaluated trXAS and trRIXS cross-sections for representative electron configurations $3d^9$ and $3d^8$ demonstrate the insights that can be obtained from charge transfer pumping, and how this nonequilibrium process affects ground and excited state properties. The straightforward characterization of the excitations in these systems, based on our analysis of the simulations, can serve as a benchmark for future experiments, as access to these time-resolved spectroscopic techniques becomes more widely available.</description>

Abstract: In designing material functionalities for transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are key determinants. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, growth kinetics, and stoichiometry precision, particularly for metastable phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond conventional pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented with stronger oxidation at elevated temperatures, whereas growth kinetics is sustained by laser ablation at lower temperatures. We demonstrate the accurate growth of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure with alternating single and double NiO2 layers possessing distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy, as a parent of high-temperature superconductor. The GOALL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Fully Augmented Matrix Product States (FAMPS) methods to investigate the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model. To differentiate between the Columnar Valence Bond Solid (CVBS) and Plaquette Valence Bond Solid (PVBS) phases, we introduce an anisotropy $\Delta_y$ in the nearest neighboring coupling in the $y$-direction, aiming at detecting the possible spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. In the calculations, we push the bond dimension to as large as $D = 25000$ in FAMPS, simulating systems at a maximum size of $14 \times 14$. With a careful extrapolation of the truncation errors and appropriate finite-size scaling, followed by finite $\Delta_y$ scaling analysis of the VBS dimer order parameters, we identify the VBS phase as a PVBS type, meaning there is no spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. This study not only resolves the long-standing issue of the characterization of the VBS order in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model but also highlights the capabilities of FAMPS in the study of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Multinode quantum spin liquids in extended Kitaev honeycomb models: the view from variational Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the discovery by variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods of a series of multinode quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in extended Kitaev models on the honeycomb lattice. Like the gapless Kitaev spin liquid with its two nodes at K and K$^\prime$, these multinode QSLs are characterized by an emergent Z$_2$ gauge structure and a discrete number of symmetry-protected Majorana cones in their low-energy excitation spectrum. Because the cones are gapped by weak magnetic fields, nonzero Chern numbers are obtained and the ground state becomes one of many possible Abelian or non-Abelian chiral spin liquids. Here we focus on the projective symmetry group (PSG)-guided VMC approach to the Kitaev model with various symmetry-allowed extended interactions. Based on the VMC phase diagrams of these models, we propose a framework for the classification of nodal QSLs that includes the PSG, the chiralities of the cones, and the way in which the cones are symmetry-related. At present, the known candidate Kitaev materials seem to lie outside the parameter regimes of the multinode QSL phases. However, with more than 100 Z$_2$ PSGs for spin-orbit-coupled states on the honeycomb lattice, we anticipate that more than one multinode QSL will be realized experimentally in future work.</description>

Abstract: A ferroic alignment of a time-reversal-even axial vector, which is called the ferroaxial ordered state, is identified by the spontaneous rotational distortion of the lattice structure to break the vertical mirror symmetry. We theoretically investigate what happens in the electronic structure once the ferroaxial ordering occurs by analyzing a tetragonal d-p cluster model with transition metal oxide in mind. By adopting the symmetry-adapted multipole representation, we elucidate the emergent cross-product form of the spin-orbit coupling by the interplay between the atomic spin-orbit coupling and the d-p hybridization according to the vertical mirror symmetry breaking, which corresponds to the electronic order parameter of the ferroaxial ordering.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Symmetries as Ground States of Local Superoperators: Hydrodynamic Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry algebras of quantum many-body systems with locality can be understood using commutant algebras, which are defined as algebras of operators that commute with a given set of local operators. In this work, we show that these symmetry algebras can be expressed as frustration-free ground states of a local superoperator, which we refer to as a ``super-Hamiltonian". We demonstrate this for conventional symmetries such as $Z_2$, $U(1)$, and $SU(2)$, where the symmetry algebras map to various kinds of ferromagnetic ground states, as well as for unconventional ones that lead to weak ergodicity breaking phenomena of Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars. In addition, we show that the low-energy excitations of this super-Hamiltonian can be understood as approximate symmetries, which in turn are related to slowly relaxing hydrodynamic modes in symmetric systems. This connection is made precise by relating the super-Hamiltonian to the superoperator that governs the operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits, and this physical interpretation also provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions. We find examples of gapped/gapless super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence/presence of slow-modes, which happens in the presence of discrete/continuous symmetries. In the gapless cases, we recover hydrodynamic modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry, Hilbert space fragmentation, and a tower of quantum scars respectively. In all, this demonstrates the power of the commutant algebra framework in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of exact symmetries, and associated approximate symmetries and hydrodynamic modes, and their dynamical consequences in systems with locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum many-body spin systems, the interplay between the entangling effect of multi-qubit Pauli measurements and the disentangling effect of single-qubit Pauli measurements may give rise to two competing effects. By introducing a randomized measurement pattern with such bases, a phase transition can be induced by altering the ratio between them. In this work, we numerically investigate a measurement-based model associated with the $(2+1)$d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fradkin-Shenker Hamiltonian model, encompassing the deconfining, confining, and Higgs phases. We determine the phase diagram in our measurement-only model by employing entanglement measures. For the bulk topological order, we use the topological entanglement entropy. We also use the mutual information between separated boundary regions to diagnose the boundary phase transition associated with the Higgs or the bulk SPT phase. We observe the structural similarity between our phase diagram and the one in the standard quantum Hamiltonian formulation of the Fradkin-Shenker model with the open rough boundary. First, a deconfining phase is detected by nonzero and constant topological entanglement entropy. Second, we find a (boundary) phase transition curve separating the Higgs=SPT phase from the rest. In certain limits, the topological phase transitions reside at the critical point of the formation of giant homological cycles in the bulk 3d spacetime lattice, as well as the bond percolation threshold of the boundary 2d spacetime lattice when it is effectively decoupled from the bulk. Additionally, there are analogous mixed-phase properties at a certain region of the phase diagram, emerging from how we terminate the measurement-based procedure. Our findings pave an alternative pathway to study the physics of Higgs=SPT phases on quantum devices in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common technique in the study of complex quantum-mechanical systems is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian by using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. While the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation achieves this and constructs an effective Hamiltonian, its scaling is suboptimal, it is limited to two subspaces, and implementing it efficiently is both challenging and error-prone. We introduce an algorithm for constructing an equivalent effective Hamiltonian as well as a Python package, Pymablock, that implements it. Our algorithm combines an optimal asymptotic scaling and the ability to handle any number of subspaces with a range of other improvements. The package supports numerical and analytical calculations of any order and it is designed to be interoperable with any other packages for specifying the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the package handles constructing a k.p model, analyses a superconducting qubit, and computes the low-energy spectrum of a large tight-binding model. We also compare its performance with reference calculations and demonstrate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Density-wave-like gap evolution in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure revealed by ultrafast optical spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density wave (DW) order is believed to be correlated with superconductivity in the recently discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. However, experimental investigations of its evolution under high pressure are still lacking. Here, we explore the quasiparticle dynamics in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy under high pressures up to 34.2 GPa. At ambient pressure, the temperature-dependent relaxation dynamics demonstrate a phonon bottleneck effect due to the opening of an energy gap around 151 K. The energy scale of the DW-like gap is determined to be 66 meV by the Rothwarf-Taylor model. Combined with recent experiential results, we propose that this DW-like transition at ambient pressure and low temperature is spin density wave (SDW). With increasing pressure, this SDW order is significantly suppressed up to 13.3 GPa before it completely disappears around 26 GPa. Remarkably, at pressures above 29.4 GPa, we observe the emergence of another DW-like order with a transition temperature of approximately 135 K, which is probably related to the predicted charge density wave (CDW) order. Our study provides the experimental evidence of the evolution of the DW-like gap under high pressure, offering critical insights into the correlation between DW order and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions and characteristic lengthscales in flat band superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of an unconventional form of high temperature superconductivity in flat band (FB) material does not cease to challenge our understanding of the physics in correlated systems. Here, we calculate the normal and anomalous one-particle correlation functions in various one and two dimensional FB systems and systematically extract the characteristic lengthscales. When the Fermi energy is located in the FB, it is found that the coherence length ($\xi$) is of the order of the lattice spacing and weakly sensitive to the strength of the electron-electron interaction. Recently, it has been argued that in FB compounds $\xi$ could be decomposed into a conventional part of BCS type ($\xi_{BCS}$) and a geometric contribution which characterises the FB eigenstates, the quantum metric ($\langle g \rangle$). However, by calculating the coherence length in two possible ways, our calculations show that $\xi \neq \sqrt{\langle g \rangle.}$ This may suggest that the link between QM and coherence length is more complex, and leaves us with the open question: what is the appropriate definition of the coherence length in flat-band systems?</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics, magnetic properties, and global $U(1)$ symmetry breaking of the S-type Gubser-Rocha model</title>

Abstract: We study an explicit formula for the thermodynamic potential of the AdS dyonic black brane solution with an axio-dilaton hair, which was discovered in an extension of the $(3+1)$d Gubser-Rocha model enjoying S-duality. From the thermodynamic potential, we can compute the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibilities of the dyonic solution. The result of the magnetization is negative implying that the system is diamagnetic. Subsequently, we consider a specific neutral limit of the dyonic solution. In this setup, we find that the system exhibits spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. The order parameter is given by a complex operator which is dual to the axio-dilaton field in the bulk. Interestingly, the system has a finite Hall conductivity even in the absence of the external magnetic field, and it is related to the phase of the complex operator.</description>

      <title>How pure can we go with adiabatic state manipulation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative systems with decoherence free subspaces, a.k.a. dark spaces (DSs), can be used to protect quantum information. At the same time, dissipation is expected to give rise to coherent information degradation outside the DS. Employed to support quantum information platforms, DSs can be adiabatically modified in a way that resembles adiabatic control of coherent systems. Here we study the slow evolution of a purely dissipative system with a spectral gap $\gamma$, characterized by a strong symmetry, under a cyclic protocol with period $T$. Non-adiabatic corrections to the state evolution give rise to decoherence: the evolution within the instantaneous DS is described by a time-local effective Liouvillian operator that leads to purity degradation over a period, of order $1/\gamma T$. We obtain a closed form of the latter to order $1/(\gamma T)^2$. Our analysis underlines speed limitations in quantum information processing in the absence of corrective measures.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of spin transport in the Haldane-Shastry chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use kinetic theory and the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to derive the hydrodynamics of spin transport in the Haldane-Shastry chain. We obtain analytical expressions for relaxation from weak-domain-wall initial conditions and corresponding predictions for the spin Drude weight. We corroborate the latter against an exact microscopic calculation at infinite temperature and Luttinger-liquid expectations at zero temperature. We further obtain an analytical expression for the long-wavelength dynamics of the longitudinal spin structure factor at all fillings and temperatures. We show that the latter interpolates between an empirically exact expression that we have found at infinite temperature and the long-wavelength limit of the Haldane-Zirnbauer formula at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>
