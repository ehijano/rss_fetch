      <title>Models for elementary particles under a unified framework without making use of gauge symmetry</title>

Abstract: This paper consists of two parts. In the first part, a concise reformulation is derived for that part of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) electroweak interaction Hamiltonian, which describes interactions between leptons (in the first generation) and vector bosons. In this reformulation, different particle species are associated with different types of spinor spaces for the description of their spin states and, as a consequence, the former are characterizable by configurations of the latter. In the second part, based on results of the first part, a framework is proposed which may be useful for constructing models of elementary particles and their interactions without making use of gauge symmetry at the fundamental level. Three models within this framework are constructed and studied. The first model predicts the above mentioned part of the GWS electroweak interactions, while, it suffers a flaw. Remove of the flaw by a small modification gives rise to a second model; and, as a byproduct of the modification, this model contains only one coupling constant, with the Weinberg angle fixed at $\sin^2 \theta_{W} = 0.25$. The third model predicts interactions that show certain similarities to strong interactions, with the quantum number of color related to certain type of spinor-space configuration.</description>

      <title>Spacetime uncertainty makes quantum field theory finite</title>

Abstract: Since Einstein's equations $G_{ij} = 8\pi \, G \, T_{ij} \, / c^4 $ relate the metric $g_{ij}$ of spacetime to the energy-momentum tensor $T_{ij}$ which is a quantum field, the metric $g_{ij}$ must be a quantum field. And since the metric $g_{ij}(x)$ is the dot product $g_{ij}(x) = \partial_i p^\alpha(x) \, \partial_j p_\alpha(x)$ of the derivatives of the points $p(x)$ of spacetime, spacetime must be a quantum field. Its points have average values $\langle p(x) \rangle$ that obey general relativity and fluctuations $q(x) = p(x) - \langle p(x) \rangle$ that obey quantum mechanics. It is suggested that the fields of quantum field theory be regarded not as functions $\phi(x)$ of their classical coordinates $x$ but as functions $\phi(p(x))$ of their quantum coordinates $p(x)$. In empty flat spacetime where $p(x) = x + q(x)$ and $x = (t, \boldsymbol x)$, the Fourier exponentials $\exp(i k(x+q(x))$ averaged over normally distributed fluctuations $q(x)$ are gaussians $\exp(i kx -\ell^2 \boldsymbol k^2 - \ell^2 m^2/2)$. These gaussians make Feynman diagrams finite. The zero-point energy density of the vacuum also is finite -- but negative and too large to explain dark energy unless new bosons exist.</description>
