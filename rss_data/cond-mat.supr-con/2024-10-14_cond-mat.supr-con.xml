      <title>Casimir effect in Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Josephson junction, the supercurrent is determined by both the discrete sub-gap part of the spectrum due to Andreev bound states and the continuous part of the spectrum from energy states outside the superconducting gap. We consider the cohesive force exerted on a junction, which is thermodynamically conjugated to the superflow, and comment on its connection to the Casimir effect in quantum electrodynamics. In contrast to the supercurrent, it is shown that in ballistic short junctions, the force is predominantly contributed by the continuum. Its magnitude is universally defined by the energy gap and coherence length of the superconductor per spin-dependent transverse mode. This force scales non-analytically with the junction length and is periodic with the superconducting phase. For long ballistic junctions, the force results from the interplay of oscillatory contributions originating from both bound states and the continuum. The resulting asymptotic limit for the force is established, including the correction terms. Thermal and impurity effects on the force are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Superconducting memory and trapped magnetic flux in ternary lanthanum polyhydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting memory is a promising technology for data storage because of its speed, high energy efficiency, non-volatility, and compatibility with quantum computing devices. However, the need for cryogenic temperatures makes superconducting memory an extremely expensive and specialized device. Ternary lanthanum polyhydrides, due to their high critical temperatures of 240-250 K, represent a convenient platform for studying effects associated with superconductivity in disordered granular systems. In this work, we investigate a trapped magnetic flux and memory effects in recently discovered lanthanum-neodymium (La,Nd)H$_{10}$ and lanthanum-scandium (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ superhydrides at a pressure of 175-196 GPa. We use a steady magnetic field of a few Tesla (T) and strong pulsed fields up to 68 T to create the trapped flux state in the compressed superhydrides. A study of the current-voltage characteristics and voltage-temperature curves of the samples with frozen magnetic flux indicates a significant memory effect in La-Sc polyhydrides already at 225-230 K.</description>

      <title>Bodge: Python package for efficient tight-binding modeling of superconducting nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bodge is a free and open-source Python package for constructing large-scale real-space tight-binding models for calculations in condensed matter physics. "Large-scale" means that it should remain performant even for lattices with millions of atoms, and "real-space" means that the model is formulated in terms of individual lattice sites and not in momentum space, for example.
  Although general tight-binding models can be constructed with this package, the main focus is on the Bogoliubov-De Gennes ("BoDGe") Hamiltonian used to model superconductivity in the clean limit. The package is designed to be easy to use, flexible, and extensible - and very few lines of code are required to model heterostructures containing, e.g., conventional and unconventional superconductors, ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnetism, and spin-orbit coupling.
  In other words: If you want a lattice model for superconducting nanostructures, and want something that is computationally efficient yet easy to use, Bodge should be a good choice.</description>

      <title>Density of states in the heterostructure ferromagnetic insulator-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spin valve composed of a superconducting film (S) between two ferromagnetic insulators (FI) on two sides. In the dirty limit the superconductor is described by Usadel equations. Appropriate boundary conditions were chosen for two S-FI interfaces, which are described via the interface parameter spin mixing angle. By numerically solving the Usadel equations, the density of states (DOS) at different spin mixing angles were obtained. It was shown previously that critical temperature of such FI-S-FI structure depends on the mutual alignment of the FI layers magnetization. We follow the evolution of DOS at change of misalignment of ferromagnets magnetization and probe the zero bias peak creation. The DOS characteristic features may give a fruitful information about triplet superconducting components creation and interplay inside the S layer.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic and Quantum Effects on the Vibrational and Superconducting Properties of Fm-3m and I43d NbH3 Under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles calculations are employed to explore the influence of quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the crystal structure and superconductivity of Fm-3m and I43d NbH3 under pressures ranging from 100 to 300 GPa for the Fm-3m-NbH3 and 187 GPa for the I43d-NbH3, employing the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The study predicts corrections to the crystal lattice parameters, phonon spectra, superconductivity and the phase transition order under high pressure. Our calculations, based on the self-consistent harmonic approximation method that extends beyond perturbation theory to include anharmonicity, indicate that the Fm-3m phase remains dynamically stable up to at least 145 GPa, which is approximately 145 GPa lower than the pressures predicted by the harmonic approximation. Furthermore, the structure with the I43d space group is found to be dynamically unstable with our anharmonic treatment. The electron-phonon coupling constants ({\lambda}) for Fm3 m NbH3 are suppressed by pressure from 2.14 at 167 GPa to 1.65 at 227 GPa. Notably, this reduction in {\lambda} does not lead to a rapid decrease in the critical temperature (Tc). The anharmonic Tc values obtained from the McMillan equation for Fm-3m NbH3 are in good agreement with experimental findings. These results underscore the pivotal role of quantum anharmonic effects in stabilizing the Fm-3m phase and determining the phase transition order in NbH3.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Heat Transport under Phonon Confinement in Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transport in bulk materials is well described using the Debye theory of 3D vibrational modes (phonons) and the acoustic match model. However, in cryogenic nanodevices, phonon wavelengths exceed device dimensions, leading to confinement effects that standard models fail to address. With the growing application of low-temperature devices in communication, sensing, and quantum technologies, there is an urgent need for models that accurately describe heat transport under confinement. We introduce a computational approach to obtain phonon heat capacity and heat transport rates between solids in various confined geometries, that can be easily integrated into, e.g., the standard two-temperature model.
  Confinement significantly reduces heat capacity and may slow down heat transport. We have validated our model in experiments on strongly disordered NbTiN superconducting nanostructures, widely used in highly efficient single-photon detectors, and we argue that confinement is due to their polycrystalline granular structure. These findings point to potential advances in cryogenic device performance through tailored material and microstructure engineering.</description>

      <title>Magnonic Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a new superconducting state with partial spin polarization induced by a magnetic field. This state, which we call "magnonic superconductor", lacks a conventional pairing order parameter, but is characterized instead by a composite order parameter that represents the binding of electron pairs and magnons. We rigorously demonstrate the existence of magnonic superconductivity with high transition temperature in a triangular lattice Hubbard model with repulsive interaction. We further show that magnonic Cooper pairs can attract to form higher-charge bound states, which can give rise to charge-$6e$ superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Sign structure of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$J$ model and its physical consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13498v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the doped Mott insulator is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we first explicitly identify a new sign structure in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice that replaces the conventional Fermi statistics for weakly interacting electrons. Then we show that the singular, i.e., the phase-string part of the sign structure in the partition function can be precisely turned off in a modified model. The density matrix renormalization group method is then employed to study these two models comparatively on finite-size systems, which is designed to unveil the consequences of the phase-string component. We find that the hole pairing is present not only in the quasi-long-range superconducting phase but also in the stripe phase of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model. However, once the phase-string is switched off, both the superconducting and stripe orders together with the underlying hole pairing disappear. The corresponding ground state reduces to a trivial Fermi-liquid-like state with small hole Fermi pockets that is decoupled from the antiferromagnetic spin background. It is in sharp contrast to the original $t$-$t'$-$J$ model where large Fermi surfaces can be restored in the stripe phase found at $t'/t&lt;0$ or the superconducting phase at $t'/t&gt;0$ in the six-leg ladder calculation. Our study clearly demonstrates that the strong correlation effect in doped Mott insulator should be mainly attributed to the long-range quantum entanglement between the spin and charge, which is, non-perturbatively, beyond a simple spin-charge separation under the no double occupancy constraint.</description>
