      <title>Diquark size effects in the quark-diquark approximation for baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryons can be described within several theoretical frameworks. Among them, the constituent approach is widely used. In this context, we aim to evaluate the accuracy of a particular model of baryons: the quark-diquark approximation. It consists in separating the three-body system into two subsequent two-body ones: a pair of two quarks, the diquark, and a second system consisting of the diquark and the third quark. This approximation is widely used, but its accuracy is rarely evaluated. The goal of this work is to perform this evaluation by comparing the quark-diquark model with a three-body model, both using the same semi-relativistic interaction. The baryon masses and some characteristic distances are computed and analysed within both approaches. Additionally, an original procedure to establish the quark-diquark potential will be presented with the aim to increase the precision of this approximation. It is shown that a diquark must not necessarily be compact to obtain good baryon masses.</description>

      <title>Portals to New Physics: The W-Quark Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore new EFT operators where single new exotic states interact with the Standard Model through an asymmetric Standard Model portal with couplings to at least one quark and one W boson. Effective operators up to dimension 6 are considered, and we specify SM charges of all new states accessible through this portal. We explore our interactions by detailing possible collider production processes at e-p and p-p colliders. Finally, we study the LHC production of a new weak-quadruplet SU(3) fundamental fermion which can be singly produced in association with a SM quark through W-quark portal processes.</description>

      <title>Inferring the breakdown scales of the chiral expansions for $g_A$ and $m_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Bayesian inference to the order-by-order chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) expansions for the axial-vector coupling constant $g_A$ and the nucleon mass m_N, and thereby infer the scales at which $\chi$PT breaks down for these two observables. Using a pointwise Bayesian analysis, we find that the inferred breakdown scales are notably different for the two observables. For the chiral expansion of $g_A$, we obtain $251^{+20}_{-50}$ MeV and $211^{+20}_{-30}$ MeV using two distinct sets of low-energy constants, while for the chiral expansion of $m_N$ we infer a significantly larger breakdown scale of $491^{+60}_{-90}$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Photon emission from weakly magnetized neutral pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a hadronic framework, we derive an explicit expression for photon production from neutral pions in a weak background magnetic field. Our calculation is built on the proton triangle diagram with an effective Yukawa $\pi^0$-proton coupling, offering an alternative to quark-level descriptions that is advantageous when the magnetic length greatly exceeds the proton size. Corrections to the pion decay constant are computed up to second order in the magnetic field strength, revealing that the field generally suppresses the decay rate. Quantitatively, however, the effect remains modest even for fields as strong as $|eB|\simeq m_\pi^2$. The differential photon emission rate exhibits anisotropy, with the strongest suppression occurring when the pion momentum is perpendicular to the magnetic field. Overall, the modification of the $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ rate is parametrically small, scaling as $|eB|^2/m_P^4$, where $m_P$ is the proton mass. Nevertheless, under favorable conditions, the resulting angular anisotropy could lead to observable signatures in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>The impact of inclusive electron ion collider data on the strong coupling determination in a global PDF fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the impact of data from the upcoming Electron Ion Collider (EIC) on the determination of the strong coupling within the context of the global MSHT fitting framework. To achieve this, we generate EIC electron-proton scattering pseudodata according to both conservative and optimistic experimental uncertainty projections and perform a simultaneous fit to obtain the proton PDFs and the value of the strong coupling. In the conservative case the impact is found to be moderate, but non-negligible, while in the optimistic case it is observed to be rather significant. These results therefore underline the promising potential for the EIC in the determination of the strong coupling. We in addition explore the impact of any potential tensions between the EIC data and the rest of the data in the global fit by injecting explicit inconsistencies into the pseudodata generation. This can lead to a noticeable bias in the extracted value of the strong coupling, highlighting the importance of accounting for all sources of theoretical uncertainty in the fit as well as the relevance of an enlarged, conservative, error definition in the determination of the strong coupling.</description>

      <title>On the efficiency of parameter space exploration: A scotogenic case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common problem in beyond Standard Model phenomenology is the exploration of a multi-dimensional parameter space in view of a large number of constraints. We study and compare two methods applicable to this challenge, namely a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scan (MCMC) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We illustrate both methods via their application to different scotogenic frameworks, allowing to extend the Standard Model to include viable dark matter candidates while generating neutrino mass terms at the one-loop level. Our studies allow us to compare the two employed methods, both at the level of phenomenology and at the level of computing effort. We find that, while phenomenologically speaking both methods deliver compatible conclusions, the obtained datasets feature differences at the detail level in the distributions of observables, e.g. the dark matter mass.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis in Type I Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-I seesaw models with a spontaneously broken $B-L$ symmetry provide a natural framework for spontaneous leptogenesis driven by a Majoron. The kinetic background of the Majoron acts as a CP-violating source, generating a lepton asymmetry both through the decay of right-handed neutrinos and through equilibration via inverse-decay processes. We construct the Boltzmann equations in a fully consistent manner, incorporating both effects, to enable a quantitative analysis. When the neutrino Yukawa coupling is large enough to maintain $B-L$ violating interactions in thermal equilibrium, the resulting asymmetry closely tracks its equilibrium value. In contrast, when this condition is not satisfied, a nontrivial interplay emerges between decay and inverse-decay dynamics, determined by the Yukawa coupling strength and the initial abundance of right-handed neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Constraining meV Axion Dark Matter with ALMA Observations of the Galactic Center Magnetar SGR 1745-2900</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a mm-wave search for axions from the magnetar SGR 1745-2900, based on 4.8 h of ALMA observations. No statistically significant features are detected between 133.99-135.78, 135.91-137.70, 145.99-147.78, and 147.99-149.78 GHz. Interpreting this null result via resonant conversion with a state-of-the-art star model and the dark-matter density expected at the Galactic Center, we constrain the axion-photon coupling at the level of $g_{\gamma}\gtrsim 2\times10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ within 0.55-0.62 meV, accessing for the first time the QCD axion parameter space near the meV scale.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector molecules $\Upsilon B_{c}^{-}$ and $\eta_{b}B_{c}^{\ast-} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axial-vector hadronic molecules $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}=\Upsilon B_{c}^{-} $ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_{\mathrm{AV}}=\eta_{b}B_{c}^{\ast -} $ with the quark content $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are studied using QCD sum rule method. The spectroscopic parameters of these molecules are computed in the context of the two-point sum rule method. Predictions for their masses are identical to each other and confirm that they are structures unstable against dissociations to ordinary heavy mesons. We evaluate the width of the state $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ and assume that it is equal to that of $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_{\mathrm{AV}} $. To this end, we explore its dominant decay channels $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}} \to \Upsilon B_{c}^{-} $ and $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}} \to \eta_{b}B_{c}^{\ast -}$. There also are subleading modes of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ generated due to annihilation of $\overline{b}b$ quarks. We consider decays of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ to pairs of the mesons $B^{\ast -} \overline{D}^{0}$, $\overline{B}^{\ast 0} D^{-}$, $B^{-} \overline{D} ^{\ast 0}$, $\overline{B}^{0} D^{\ast -}$, $\overline{B}_{s}^{\ast 0} D_{s}^{-}$, and $\overline{B}_{s}^{0} D_{s}^{\ast -}$. To find strong couplings at the $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$-meson-meson vertices which determine the partial widths of these processes, we apply QCD three-point sum rule approach. The mass $m=(15800 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma [\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}]=(112 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the molecule $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ are useful for experimental studies of fully heavy molecular structures at ongoing and planning experiments.</description>

      <title>On the determination of the proton electromagnetic form factors from the DVCS measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the proton electromagnetic form factors (FFs) using exclusive photon leptoproduction (EP) data in kinematic regions where the Bethe-Heitler (BH) contribution dominates the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) cross section. By exploiting the strong sensitivity of the BH amplitude to the Dirac and Pauli FFs, we determine $F_{1}(t)$, $F_{2}(t)$ and the corresponding Sachs FFs from several fitting scenarios based on dipole and $ P $-pole parametrizations, and evaluate the charge and magnetic radii of the proton. We show that EP measurements in the range $ 0.11 &lt; |t| &lt; 0.45 $ GeV$ ^2 $ provide meaningful constraints on $F_{1}(t)$, while offering limited sensitivity to $F_{2}(t)$. Our results systematically favor smaller charge radius values compared with those from traditional elastic electron-proton scattering measurements, consistent with recent high-precision PRad measurements. This study demonstrates that EP measurements, especially when covering smaller values of $|t|$, can serve as a complementary and powerful tool for determining the proton electromagnetic structure and may offer additional insight into the long-standing charge-radius puzzle. The methodology developed here establishes a framework for future combined analyses of EP and elastic electron-proton scattering data which enables a unified determination of the nucleon FFs.</description>

      <title>Probing anomalous $W^-W^+\gamma/Z$ couplings in the SMEFT with $e^-e^+ \to W^-W^+ \to 4j/\ell^-\ell^+\slashed{E}$ channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous charged triple gauge boson couplings induced by $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators in the HISZ basis through the processes $e^-e^+ \to 4j$ and $e^-e^+ \to \ell^-\ell^+ + \text{missing energy}$ at $\sqrt{s}=250\,$GeV with longitudinally polarized beams. The analysis includes three CP-even operators $(O_{WWW}, O_W, O_B)$ and two CP-odd operators $(\tilde O_{WWW}, \tilde O_W)$, which parameterize deviations in the $W^-W^+\gamma/Z$ vertex. All leading-order contributions are included, including interference between $W^-W^+$ production and non-resonant amplitudes. In the $e^-e^+ \to 4j$ channel, $W^-W^+$ candidates are selected using boosted decision trees. The $W$-boson charges are reconstructed using a jet-charge observable, and jet flavors from $W$ decays are identified with a dedicated classifier, enabling measurements of vector polarization and correlation asymmetries. In the $e^-e^+ \to \ell^-\ell^+ + \text{missing energy}$ channel, events are selected with cuts on lepton transverse momentum and dilepton mass, and the two neutrino momenta are reconstructed using neural-network regression. Combining total cross sections with spin asymmetries allows constraints on anomalous gauge couplings. The fully hadronic channel provides the strongest sensitivity to $O_B$ and $\tilde O_W$, while the semi-leptonic channel yields tighter limits on $O_{WWW}$, $O_W$, and $\tilde O_{WWW}$. The fully leptonic channel adds complementary sensitivity. Finally, we derive marginalized limits on all five operators using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for several choices of systematic uncertainties and integrated luminosities.</description>

      <title>Nucleon 3D intrinsic spin structure from the weak-neutral axial-vector form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic 3D weak-neutral axial-vector four-current and spin distributions inside a nucleon (or a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron) including three weak-neutral axial-vector form factors are investigated for the first time. We clarify that the relativistic 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame is completely described by the induced pseudotensor form factor $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than by the axial form factor $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We demonstrate that $R_A \equiv \sqrt{ \frac{-6}{G_A^Z(0) }\frac{\text{d} G_A^Z(Q^2) }{\text{d} Q^2} \Big|_{Q^2=0} }$ can not be interpreted as the physically meaningful 3D root-mean-square axial radius of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron. The genuine axial radius for any spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ hadron in fact does not exist. We also show that the relativistic 3D weak-neutral spin radius $r_\text{spin} = \sqrt{\langle r_\text{spin}^2 \rangle}$, with $\langle r_\text{spin}^2 \rangle \equiv R_A^2 + \frac{ 1 }{ 4M^2 }\left[ 1 + \frac{ 2 G_P^Z(0) }{ G_A^Z(0) } \right]$ based on the relativistic and intrinsic 3D weak-neutral spin distribution in the Breit frame, is a physically meaningful radius that can be unambiguously defined for the nucleon, which provides an additional key motivation for the further determination of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $G_P^Z(Q^2)$. Numerically, we find that $R_A \approx 0.6510~\text{fm}$, $r_\text{spin} \approx 2.1054~\text{fm}$ and $\overline r_\text{spin} \equiv r_\text{spin}/3 \approx 0.7018~\text{fm}$. For future experimental measurements of $G_A^Z(Q^2)$ and $G_T^Z(Q^2)$, we also derive the full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections for neutrino-proton and antineutrino-proton elastic scattering in the lab frame, in hoping to provide a complementary and new perspective to unveil the nucleon spin structure by using (anti)neutrino-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Solving the Inverse Source Problem in Femtoscopy with a Toy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadron-hadron interactions, as a non-perturbative effect, play a significant role in understanding phenomenological problems in particle physics. Femtoscopy is a powerful tool in heavy-ion collision experiments, enabling the extraction of hadron-hadron interactions via momentum-correlation functions (CFs). These CFs are generally factorized into a convolution of source functions and hadron-hadron wave functions, with the latter encoding information about hadron-hadron interactions. However, source functions remain ambiguous and are commonly approximated by a Gaussian form. Reconstructing source functions from experimental correlation data constitutes an ``inverse problem." To address it, we propose a toy model based on the Tikhonov regularization. Employing a square potential well of four distinct potential strengths, we calculate the CFs for inputs of a Gaussian source function and its hybrid form. The obtained CFs are subsequently used to reconstruct the source functions via the Tikhonov regularization. Our results demonstrate that the Gaussian source function can be successfully reconstructed, indicating the potential of this approach for extracting realistic source functions of hadron pairs of interest in the future.</description>

      <title>Could electron-top interactions spoil the measurement of the Higgs trilinear? -A quantitative estimate at future lepton colliders-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the Higgs self-coupling is considered the next milestone in the study of the Higgs boson properties. At future $e^+e^-$ facilities below the double Higgs production threshold, this is extracted from the $Zh$ production cross-section, which is sensitive to the trilinear coupling at the one-loop level. At the same perturbative order, potential effects beyond the Standard Model (SM) may affect the Higgstrahlung rate and distort the self-coupling determination. We study the question focusing especially on contact interactions containing two electron and two top-quark fields. We conclude that, in the context of FCC-ee and its planned runs at different energies, $eett$ interactions change the Higgs self-coupling sensitivity below the percent level. Even in the most pessimistic scenarios, we confirm a robust sensitivity of the order of 17% at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level under the assumption of otherwise SM-like Higgs couplings. A crucial role in these results is played by the measurement of fermion pair production above the $Z$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Constraining and Resolving Lorentz-Violating New Physics at ESSnuSB Using Complementarity with DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the sensitivity of the ESSnuSB and DUNE long-baseline neutrino experiments to isotropic, CPT-violating Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). Using detailed simulations for the 360 km and 540 km ESSnuSB baselines and the 1300 km DUNE setup, we assess how LIV parameters influence oscillation probabilities, event spectra, and degeneracies among oscillation parameters. We find that LIV-induced modifications can closely mimic variations in $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\rm CP}$, potentially leading to incorrect determination of the atmospheric mixing angle octant and the leptonic CP phase if LIV effects are not accounted for. Although combining the two ESSnuSB baselines improves overall sensitivity, it does not fully remove these degeneracies. In contrast, a joint ESSnuSB+DUNE analysis benefiting from the synergy between second-maximum sensitivity at ESSnuSB and first-maximum, matter-enhanced sensitivity at DUNE can successfully resolve all these degeneracies and can yield significantly stronger constraints on all the LIV parameters. The results presented here highlights the essential role of multi-baseline, multi-energy experimental strategies to probe Planck-suppressed Lorentz-violating new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact form of the massive 1$\to$3 tree-level QCD splitting functions, enabling fast evaluation and improved numerical stability in practical applications. We discuss a decomposition of the results in terms of lower-order splitting functions, scalar dipole antenna functions and pure splitting remainders. The two-gluon radiator functions introduced in this context generalize the expressions obtained from the double-soft approximation.</description>

      <title>Minimal lepton models with non-holomorphic modular $A_{4}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive bottom-up analysis of lepton mass and mixing based on the non-holomorphic $A_{4}$ modular symmetry. Neutrinos are assumed to be Majorana particles and the light neutrino masses are generated through the Weinberg operator. In this framework, we construct all phenomenologically viable models with minimal number of free parameters, where the Yukawa couplings are expressed in terms of polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of weights $\pm4$, $\pm2$ and $0$ at level $N=3$. Without imposing generalized CP (gCP) symmetry, we identify 147 (6) viable models with seven real free parameters that successfully reproduce the current experimental data of lepton sector for the normal (inverted) mass ordering. When gCP symmetry consistent with $A_{4}$ modular symmetry is included, the number of free parameters is reduced by one, yielding 47 (5) phenomenologically viable models in the normal (inverted) mass ordering. Finally, we present detailed numerical analyses of a representative model for both mass orderings to illustrate these results.</description>

      <title>Chiral, parity-doublet, effective-Lagrangian mean-field theories for nuclear and astrophysical phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral-parity (parity-doublet) effective Lagrangian models provide a compact and symmetry-consistent framework for describing baryons and their negative-parity partners in terms of linearly-realized chiral symmetry. Unlike the conventional, linear, sigma model; the parity-doublet approach accommodates a chirally-invariant mass term, $m_0$, allowing finite baryon-masses even when the chiral condensate melts. This feature enables a unified treatment of hadronic matter across vacuum, nuclear and dense astrophysical regimes. This compact review summarizes the key structures of parity-doublet Lagrangians; outlines the mean-field formulation for nuclear and stellar matter; and highlights recent phenomenological and lattice constraints on the chirally-invariant mass. Emphasis is placed on mirror versus na\"ive chiral assignments; the role of vector interactions in achieving nuclear saturation; and the implications of parity doubling for the equation-of-state of dense matter and neutron-star cooling. The review concludes with current theoretical challenges and perspectives for extending these models beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Probing flavor-diagonal couplings of doubly-charged scalar at low and high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a TeV-scale doubly-charged scalar from the right-handed sector within the framework of left-right symmetric models. Focusing on its flavor-diagonal couplings to right-handed electrons and muons, we assess probes from both high-energy colliders and low-energy precision experiments. High-energy processes include Bhabha scattering at LEP and future circular electron-positron colliders (CEPC/FCC-ee), direct production at the LHC, and dedicated searches and precision measurements at proposed muon colliders and $\mu$TRISTAN. Low-energy observables encompass parity-violating M{\o}ller scattering, muon anomalous magnetic moment, and muonium-antimuonium oscillations. Our combined analysis indicates that for a doubly-charged scalar in the $1$-$3$ TeV range, the flavor-diagonal Yukawa couplings to electrons and muons as small as $10^{-2}$ are accessible. Observations of such a doubly-charged scalar would potentially point toward the type-I seesaw mechanism of neutrino masses in the left-right symmetric model with $D$-parity breaking.</description>

      <title>Genesis of Axion Dark Matter via Black Hole and Cosmic String Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global $U_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.</description>

      <title>Dark-pion dark matter beyond leading order: unitarized chiral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark pions are promising dark matter candidates, yet most analyses rely on leading-order (LO) chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). Motivated by the fact that, even for QCD pi-pi scattering, LO ChPT near threshold underestimates the isoscalar s-wave amplitude by an O(1) factor relative to high-precision dispersive results, we reassess the phenomenology of dark-pion dark matter in SIMP and WIMP scenarios using the chiral unitary method, a nonperturbative resummation that implements the correct analytic structure with minimal input, and quantify how unitarization modifies the standard LO ChPT picture. We fix the subtraction constant to its natural estimate, interpreted as an effective cutoff at the chiral scale, so that the unitarized amplitudes depend only on the dark-pion mass and decay constant. We show that, depending on the coupling, the unitarized amplitudes develop resonance poles absent at LO, leading to sizable departures in 2-to-2 self-scattering, relevant for SIMP scenarios, and in annihilation including initial-state interaction effects, relevant for WIMP scenarios. These modifications, in turn, affect the viable parameter space. Although the subtraction constant is, from a model-building perspective, merely a parameter, a substantial deviation from its natural value would point to additional elementary resonances with the same quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Timelike showers with jet recoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new way to impose four-momentum conservation on timelike parton-shower branchings, allowing for recoil to be imparted not only to individual partons but also to groups of partons, "jets". In this work we present an explicit realisation of this idea for a dipole parton-shower, using angular ordering to decide which partons are grouped into jets in a way that does not require explicit jet clustering at each stage of the evolution. We verify that the algorithm satisfies next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy criteria, from numerical fixed-order tests as well as resummation tests across a range of observables. Our conclusion is that jet recoils provide a viable path for adapting existing dipole/antenna-type showers to achieve NLL accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make predictions of the effects of acceleration on decay rate for three benchmark processes spanning alpha, beta and isomeric decay. These processes are observed to require lower acceleration than that required by previously studied processes. In particular for the case of isomeric decay of Thorium 229m the effects of acceleration are found to be tantalizingly close to being observable with next generation particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>E-PCN: Jet Tagging with Explainable Particle Chebyshev Networks Using Kinematic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification and classification of collimated particle sprays, or jets, are essential for interpreting data from high-energy collider experiments. While deep learning has improved jet classification, it often lacks interpretability. We introduce the Explainable Particle Chebyshev Network (E-PCN), a graph neural network extending the Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN). E-PCN integrates kinematic variables into jet classification by constructing four graph representations per jet, each weighted by a distinct variable: angular separation ($\Delta$), transverse momentum ($k_T$), momentum fraction ($z$), and invariant mass squared ($m^2$). We use the concept of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to determine which kinematic variables dominate classification outcomes. Analysis reveals that angular separation and transverse momentum collectively account for approximately 76% of classification decisions (40.72% and 35.67%, respectively), with momentum fraction and invariant mass contributing the remaining 24%. Evaluated on the JetClass dataset with 10 signal classes, E-PCN achieves a macro-accuracy of 94.67%, macro-AUC of 96.78%, and macro-AUPR of 86.79%, representing improvements of 2.36%, 4.13%, and 24.88% respectively over the baseline PCN implementation, while demonstrating physically interpretable feature learning.</description>

      <title>The $D_{s0}^*(2317)^+$ decay to $D_s^+\pi^0$ and $D_s^{*+}\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong decay of $D_{s0}^*(2317)^+$ to $D_s^+ \pi^0$ considering the coupled channels of $D^0 K^+, D^+ K^0, D_s^+ \eta$ and $D_s^+ \pi^0$ within a picture for the interaction based on the local hidden gauge approach. We also address the problem of the radiative decay to $D_s^{*+} \gamma$, using the same information obtained from the molecular picture. We obtain a strong width of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)^+$ of about $71 \,\rm keV$ and a radiative decay of $1.3 \,\rm keV$. The anomalous terms for the radiative decay are considered for the first time, but they are found negligible. We make a thorough discussion of this and other results to the light of the recent measurement of Belle for the ratio of these two decay modes, and make a call for the precise measurement of the two decay widths independently to clarify the present situation concerning the nature of of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)^+$ state.</description>

      <title>Precision Higgs Probe of Type-II Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite direct searches at the LHC excluding triplet-like Higgs bosons up to several hundred GeV over much of the type-II seesaw model parameter space, parts of it -- most notably those featuring ``cascade decays'' of the charged Higgs bosons into their neutral partners and off-shell $W$ bosons -- still remain unconstrained. Meanwhile, measurements of the diphoton signal strength of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson -- potentially modified by loop contributions from triplet-like Higgs states -- are in good agreement with the SM expectation, with combined experimental uncertainties currently at approximately 8\%. Given the trend in previous measurements, it is expected that future precision Higgs measurements at the HL-LHC and a future lepton collider such as CEPC, FCC-ee, or Muon Collider will be consistent the standard diphoton signal strength, albeit with significantly reduced uncertainties, down to about 0.7\%. Presuming this and considering all relevant constraints, we explore whether such increasingly precise diphoton measurements can indirectly probe the parameter space that currently evades direct searches. We find that sub-percent-level determinations of the diphoton rate will decisively probe a substantial fraction of this otherwise elusive region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An evolution equation for diffractive production with a definite rapidity gap is given. Coherent $\gamma^*A$ collisions in the unitarity (saturation) region are studied with the conclusion that the diffractive mass is always on the order of the $\gamma^*$ virtuality, $Q$, when the scattering is strong. Deep in the saturation region diffractive masses significantly greater than $Q$ are strongly suppressed by a Levin-Tuchin mechanism.</description>

      <title>Chiral transition in a Non-Abelian Quasi-Particle Model with three quark flavours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the recently introduced Non-Abelian Quasi-Particle Model (NAQPM) for gluons with an ideal Fermi gas of three quark species with the aim to describe the equation of state (energy density vs. temperature) of $2+1$ - flavour Lattice-QCD at zero chemical potential. Allowing temperature dependent masses for the fermions, we show that above a critical temperature $T_c$ the quark mass has to drop rapidly in order to obtain energy density values compatible with the Lattice-QCD results. Within this framework, thus, the restoration of chiral symmetry in the system is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gluon variance -- which is a fundamental quantity of the NAQPM -- is strongly correlated to the fermion mass and decreases by orders of magnitude through the transition. The high temperature phenomenological characteristics of the gluon appear consistent to properties of the perturbative QCD gluon. The model indicates that color deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are interrelated and classical configurations of the QCD dynamics play an important role to the criticality of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in shaping the structure and predictions of multi-Higgs-doublet models. In three-Higgs-doublet models considerable effort has been put into classifying possible symmetry groups and the conditions for their realisation, yet the completeness of existing classifications remains an open question. In this work, we revisit the problem of identifying realisable symmetries by re-examining conventional Higgs family and general CP transformations from an alternative perspective. Our analysis identifies certain limitations in previous approaches and introduces a clearer, more systematic framework for model builders. We expand our classification by investigating more generalised symmetry structures -- the recently identified GOOFy transformations, which act non-trivially on the Higgs doublets and their conjugates. Our analysis consolidates known results, uncovers previously overlooked structures, and expands the set of symmetries in three-Higgs-doublet models, offering both a clearer theoretical foundation and a practical reference for symmetry-based model building.</description>

      <title>Prospects for measuring electroweak production of $Z\gamma\gamma$ and 2 jets at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector boson scattering (VBS) serves as a powerful channel for probing the Standard Model, particularly the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. Currently, studies of VBS mainly focus on $2 \to 2$ scattering. In this study, we investigate the $2\to 3$ VBS process of $\text{p p} \to Z\gamma\gamma + 2~\text{jets}$ through Monte Carlo simulations, including signal generation and background analysis. The signal significance is evaluated across different phase-space regions. With an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$, the signal significance can reach about 4.5 $\sigma$. These results suggest that, given the ongoing release of the LHC Run 3 dataset, there will be promising opportunities to explore and potentially discover a series of $2\to 3$ VBS processes, starting with the $Z\gamma\gamma$ channel.</description>

      <title>Enhanced active-sterile neutrino polarizability at the intensity frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic probes of neutrinos can provide insights into physics beyond the Standard Model. Among the possible electromagnetic interactions of neutrinos is neutrino polarizability, a dimension-7 effective operator that couples two neutrinos to two photons. In this manuscript, we study a realization of the neutrino polarizability operator in which one of the active neutrinos is replaced by a sterile neutrino. We derive new constraints on this active-sterile neutrino polarizability from its contribution to neutrino-nucleus scattering with a single photon in the final state at neutrino experiments. We show that a realization of this operator via a light mediator can explain the MiniBooNE low-energy excess while remaining consistent with other experimental constraints. Finally, we comment on additional model realizations of this higher-dimensional operator.</description>

      <title>Sunset integrals with up to three mass scales in chiral perturbation theory: a comparative study of the Mellin-Barnes representation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunset integrals are among the simplest of two-loop integrals that appear in perturbative quantum field theories and possess up to four distinct mass scales. By means of integration by parts identities, they can be written in terms of four distinct master integrals. In this article, we discuss the independent configurations of on-shell and off-shell sunset master integrals with one, two and three mass scales that arise in chiral perturbation theory. We derive Mellin-Barnes integral representations of these integrals and analytically solve them using various methods to obtain exact results in the form of single and double convergent series of the hypergeometric type, for the values of the mass parameters that allow us to do so. We then discuss how to analytically continue the results to other regions of the parameters and conclude by discussing a few applications in chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the current state of knowledge of the phase diagram of QCD through lattice, effective field theories, and chiral models. Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.</description>

      <title>Possible $\nu$ Source Class: 3-sigma Detection of High-Energy Neutrinos from Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the sources of high-energy (TeV-PeV) astrophysical neutrinos is crucial for studies in both astrophysics and particle physics. Despite extensive searches for more than a decade, which revealed several individual potential sources and only one potential source class, the origins of these neutrinos remain largely unresolved; thus, more source classes should be investigated. In this work, we conduct the first search for high-energy neutrino emission from a new source class, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are also theoretically motivated. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis on our constructed catalog of 693 SMBHB candidates and 10 years of IceCube public data. Our results show positive correlations, with higher significance in more physically motivated scenarios and the highest significance at 3.0$\sigma$. In addition, we also study potential connections between SMBHBs' high-energy neutrino and nano-Hz gravitational-wave emissions, the latter being the main target of pulsar timing arrays. Our results provide the first evidence of SMBHBs being high-energy neutrino emitters.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group flows as diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. This reformulation and reinterpretation goes beyond recent developments that treat Renormalization Group flow equations as conservation laws in field space and also allows to systematically understand and handle the nonconservative contributions in flow equations numerically.
  We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more realistic systems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</description>

      <title>Generalized tension metrics for multiple cosmological datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel estimator to quantify statistical tensions among multiple cosmological datasets simultaneously. This estimator generalizes the Difference-in-Means statistic, $Q_{\rm DM}$, to the multi-dataset regime. Our framework enables the detection of dominant tension directions in the shared parameter space. It further provides a geometric interpretation of the tension for the two- and three-dataset cases in two dimensions. According to this approach, the previously reported increase in tension between DESI and Planck from $1.9\sigma$ (DR1) to $2.3\sigma$(DR2) is reinterpreted as a more modest shift from $1.18\sigma^{\rm eff}$ (DR1) to $1.45\sigma^{\rm eff}$ (DR2). These new tools may also prove valuable across research fields where dataset discrepancies arise.</description>

      <title>Pion and Kaon PDFs from Lattice QCD with Complementary Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a first-principles lattice-QCD calculation of the unpolarized quark PDF for the pion and the kaon. The lattice data rely on matrix elements calculated for boosted mesons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line. The calculations on this lattice ensemble correspond to two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$), using maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice volume is $32^3\times 64$, with a lattice spacing of 0.0934 fm, and a pion mass of 260 MeV. Matrix elements are calculated for hadron boosts of $|P_3| = 0,~0.41,~0.83,~1.25,~1.66,$ and 2.07 GeV. To match lattice QCD results to their light-cone counterparts, we employ two complementary frameworks: the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and the short-distance factorization (SDF). Using these approaches in parallel, we also test the lattice data to identify methodology-driven systematics. Results are presented for the standard quark PDFs, as well as the valence sector. Beyond obtaining the PDFs, we also explore the possibility of extracting information on SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. For LaMET, we also parametrize the momentum dependence to obtain the infinite-momentum PDFs.</description>

      <title>Maximally Symmetric Boost-Invariant Solutions of the Boltzmann Equation in Foliated Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the relativistic kinetic theory of a boost-invariant conformal gas on a static, maximally symmetric background $dS_3\times \mathbb{R}$, considering all constant-curvature slicings of $dS_3$ - flat, spherical, or hyperbolic- and their associated symmetry groups. Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution. We further comment on several relevant aspects of the new boost-invariant solution on the hyperbolic slicing and on their interpretation once mapped back to Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Testing the weak equivalence principle for nonclassical matter with torsion balances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose tests of the weak equivalence principle (WEP) using a torsion balance, in which superposition of energy eigenstates are created in a controllable way for the test masses. After general considerations on the significance of tests of the WEP using quantum states and the need for considering inertial and gravitational masses as operators, we develop a model to derive the matrix elements of the free-fall operator, showing that the variance of the acceleration operator, in addition to its mean, enables estimation of violations of the WEP due to quantum coherence in a way that is robust with respect to shot-to-shot fluctuations. Building on this analysis, we demonstrate how the validity of the WEP may be tested in a torsion balance setup, by accessing the mean and variance of a torque operator we introduce and quantize. Due to the long acquisition times of the signal as compared to the timescale on which coherent superposition states may survive, we further propose a dynamical setting, where the torsion balance is subject to a time-dependent gravitational field, and measurements of angular acceleration encode possible violations of the WEP.</description>

      <title>Identified charged hadron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV with the STAR detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results on the production of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC, at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt;$ 0.1). Invariant yields of these particles as a function of transverse momentum are shown. We determine bulk properties such as integrated particle yields ($dN/dy$), mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{T} \rangle$), particle ratios, which provide insight into the particle production mechanisms. Additionally, the kinetic freeze-out parameters ($T_\text{kin}$ and $\langle \beta_{T} \rangle$), which provide information about the dynamics of the system at the time of freeze-out, are obtained. The Bjorken energy density ($\epsilon_{BJ}$), which gives an estimate of the energy density in the central rapidity region of the collision zone at the formation time $\tau$, is calculated and presented as a function of multiplicity for various energies. The results are compared with those from the models such as A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) and Heavy Ion Jet INteraction Generator (HIJING) for further insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model in the near-extremal black brane background with quantum corrections in the near-horizon. The near-horizon geometry is described by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, and the quantum fluctuations are governed by the Schwarzian action. We introduce the Schwarzian modes into the RS metric, derive the quantum-corrected equation for the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes via the Schwinger-Dyson equation, calculate the correction to the KK mass spectrum, and discuss the impact of quantum corrections on the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. Our work introduces both quantum corrections and temperature into the RS model, providing insights into cosmology and phase transitions within it.</description>

      <title>Probing memory-burdened Primordial Black Holes with global 21 cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the imprints of memory-burdened primordial black holes (PBH) on the global 21 cm signal during the cosmic dawn. Recent studies reopened the possibility of a mass window of PBHs as a compelling candidate for dark matter, particularly in low-mass regimes ($M_{\text {PBH}}&lt; 10^{15}$ g) where conventional constraints from evaporation are being revisited in light of quantum gravitational effects. One such effect, the \textit{memory burden effect}, slows down black hole evaporation by incorporating the backreaction of radiation on the black hole microstates, substantially extending the lifetime of light PBHs and thus modifying their late-time emission spectra. This prolonged emission can dramatically alter the energy injection history in the early universe. By computing the modified energy injection rates into the intergalactic medium and incorporating them into the thermal and ionization evolution of neutral hydrogen, we obtain projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter. The bounds are obtained from the fact that these low mass PBHs, which were thought otherwise evaporated, can modify the absorption amplitude in the global 21 cm signal at redshift $z\approx17$. Considering the two viable scenarios of transition to the memory-burden phase: fast (or instantaneous) and slow (transition with a finite width), we show how the 21 cm bounds are sensitive to different mass ranges. For a broad transition with $\delta=10^{-2}$ we find that PBHs in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq10^{8}$-$10^{13}$ g are excluded at the level of $f_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{-8}$. In contrast, for a fast-transition case ($k=1$), the evaporation is suppressed so efficiently that no meaningful 21 cm constraint remains for $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{7}$ g.</description>

Abstract: The SS433 is a well-known binary system with an internal black hole, which is stripping mass from an orbiting companion of ten solar masses, at a hundred of light-seconds away. The black hole and its accretion disk fuel a thin precessing jet, whose spirals are well-observed. Surprisingly, disconnected gamma-ray tails have recently been discovered by H.E.S.S., HAWC and LHAASO, hundreds of light-years away and with energies of tens of TeV. We suggest that tens PeV neutron burst jets were ejected from the SS433 system over the past century. These beams of ultra high-energy PeVatron neutrons, by their in-flight beta decay and Inverse Compton scattering, could be the source of the enigmatic, distant and disconnected tens of TeV gamma-ray beams. These ultra-relativistic PeV neutron jets could have been formed during one of the system's rare and intense tidal eruptions, when tens of PeV protons collide CV October 2025 with thermal ultraviolet photons, creating delta resonances. Their decay into secondary neutron beams of tens of PeV is well consistent with observations. Alternative models appear uncompetitive.</description>

      <title>Paucity of downward UHE neutrino tracks in IceCube versus unexpected huge KM3-230213A event: solving the puzzles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the ARCA array detector published the down-ward-horizontal event: the KM3-230213A. It appeared as the most energetic neutrino ever observed: about 200 PeV (2 10^17 eV) up to EeV (10^18 eV) energy. This huge value, is puzzling. It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy. At EeV energy such upward tau air-showers should shine AUGER telescopes or blaze future satellite in Space. A previous model in astrophysics considered energetic neutrino E&gt;&gt;100 EeV, neutrino scattering, onto cosmic, relic, light mass ones. Their ultra-relativistic Z boson resonance formation and its decay in flight would produce hadron UHECR relics around tens-hundred EeV energy. Explaining how sources located at far distances, above the usual GZK hundred Mpc, cut off ones, may shine and cluster in AUGER or TA data.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Unfolding for Cross Section Measurements in the Presence of Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistically correcting measured cross sections for detector effects is an important step across many applications. In particle physics, this inverse problem is known as \textit{unfolding}. In cases with complex instruments, the distortions they introduce are often known only implicitly through simulations of the detector. Modern machine learning has enabled efficient simulation-based approaches for unfolding high-dimensional data. Among these, one of the first methods successfully deployed on experimental data is the \textsc{OmniFold} algorithm, a classifier-based Expectation-Maximization procedure. In practice, however, the forward model is only approximately specified, and the corresponding uncertainty is encoded through nuisance parameters. Building on the well-studied \textsc{OmniFold} algorithm, we show how to extend machine learning-based unfolding to incorporate nuisance parameters. Our new algorithm, called Profile \textsc{OmniFold}, is demonstrated using a Gaussian example as well as a particle physics case study using simulated data from the CMS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Universal relation involving fundamental modes in two-fluid dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the fundamental oscillation frequencies of dark matter admixed neutron stars, focusing on models with self-interacting fermionic dark matter that couples to normal matter solely through gravity. The analysis is carried out within a two-fluid formalism under the relativistic Cowling approximation, where the perturbation equations follow from the linearized energy-momentum conservation laws of both components. We find that the mass-scaled fundamental frequencies of the nuclear (dark) fluid in dark core (halo) configurations exhibit a remarkably tight correlation with the total stellar compactness. This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state. In contrast, we also find the breakdown of such universality with the tidal deformability, i.e, the same frequencies show substantial deviations from universality when expressed in terms of the tidal deformability. These contrasting behaviors highlight possible observational imprints of dark matter in neutron star interiors.</description>

      <title>Modified vacuum polarization in the presence of a plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vacuum polarization due to strong fields, in the presence of an electron-positron plasma. For this purpose, we expand quantum kinetic equations using weak fields and slow temporal scales as expansion parameters. It is demonstrated that the evolution of the Dirac field can be described by classical-like distribution functions for electrons and positrons, which are weakly coupled through quantum interactions. Furthermore, we deduce that these coupling terms give rise to well-known expressions for vacuum polarization, in addition to quantum modifications proportional to the content of real particles. Depending on the initial plasma density, the dominant quantum corrections to classical evolution may arise from real particle couplings or from the vacuum polarization associated with virtual particles. The implications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bound and Resonant States of Muonic Few-Body Coulomb Systems: Extended Stochastic Variational Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the bound and resonant states of hydrogen-like muonic ions ($\mu\mu p$, $\mu\mu d$, $\mu\mu t$) and three-body muonic molecular ions ($pp\mu$, $pd\mu$, $pt\mu$, $dd\mu$, $dt\mu$, $tt\mu$), and the four-body double-muonic hydrogen molecule ($\mu\mu pp$) using an extended stochastic variational method combined with complex scaling. The approach provides a unified treatment of bound and quasibound states and achieves an energy accuracy better than $0.1~\mathrm{eV}$ across all systems studied. Complete spectra below the corresponding $n=2$ atomic thresholds are obtained, including several previously unresolved shallow resonances in both three- and four-body sectors.</description>

      <title>The Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov structure of lattice BFKL evolution and the twist-two anomalous dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice regularization of the BFKL evolution, showing its bulk dynamics is governed by an abelian Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation. The Hamiltonian combines long-range hopping with virtual corrections encoded by harmonic numbers. An exact walk expansion renders Reggeisation manifest at finite system size. In the bulk continuum limit, evolution reduces to a connection on $\mathbb{P}^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$: $\Omega(x) = -2\,dx/x - 4\,dx/(1-x)$, with solutions in $\{0,1\}$-alphabet harmonic polylogarithms. Projecting to the collinear sector via Brown's single-valued map organizes the twist-two anomalous dimension's small-$\omega$ expansion, generating polynomials in odd zeta values, matching the transcendentality structure of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and multi-Regge kinematics. The lattice thus isolates the algebraic core of BFKL evolution.</description>

      <title>Topological Susceptibility and QCD Axion Mass: QED and NNLO corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.01008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the precision of the topological susceptibility of QCD, and therefore of the QCD axion mass, by including $O(\alpha_{\rm em})$ and NNLO corrections in the chiral expansion, which amount to 0.65(21)% and -0.71(29)% respectively. Both corrections are one order of magnitude smaller than the known NLO ones, confirming the very good convergence of the chiral expansion and its reliability. Using the latest estimates for the light quark masses the current uncertainty is dominated by the one of the low-energy constant $\ell_7$. When combined with possible improvements on the light quark mass ratio and $\ell_7$ from lattice QCD, our computation could allow to determine the QCD axion mass with per-mille accuracy.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the present tension between T2K and NO$\nu$A with nonstandard neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since neutrino oscillation was observed, several experiments have been built to measure its parameters. NO$\nu$A and T2K are two long-baseline experiments dedicated to measuring mainly the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, the charge-parity conjugation phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$, and the mass ordering. However, there is a tension in current data. The T2K allowed region is in conflict with the region allowed by NO$\nu$A. We propose a nonstandard charged current interaction (CC-NSI) in neutrino production to relieve this tension. The CC-NSI is computed through quantum field theory (QFT) formalism, where we derive perturbative analytical formulae considering CC-NSI in the pion decay. Within this new approach, we can alleviate NO$\nu$A and T2K tension for a CC-NSI complex parameters of order $10^{-3}$. We show the new phase has a degeneracy to the Dirac CP phase of the form $\delta_{\rm CP} \pm \phi= 1.5\pi$ being a possible source of violation of charge-parity symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new inverse seesaw model based on hidden local $U(1)$ symmetry framework where inverse seesaw mechanism is induced at one loop level. A Majorana mass term of singlet fermion is forbidden by the $U(1)$ symmetry and it is generated at one-loop level by introducing relevant particle contents to get loop diagram, inducing inverse seesaw mechanism. The same particle contents also contribute to lepton magnetic(electric) dipole moment and lepton flavor violating decays without chiral suppression. We can then obtain sizable muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment that accommodate with deviation from the standard model prediction. The constraints from lepton flavor violating decays and electron magnetic(electric) dipole moment are also discussed to explore testability of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the consequences of some representative neutrino flavor-symmetry models for tri-resonant leptogenesis (which is realized by having three nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos). To be specific, we have considered a neutrino flavor-symmetry model realizing the TM1 mixing and modular ${\rm A}^{}_4$, ${\rm S}^{}_4$ and ${\rm A}^{}_5$ symmetry models that have a right-handed neutrino mass matrix $M^{}_{\rm R}$ as shown in Eq.~(\ref{6}) which gives three exactly degenerate right-handed neutrino masses and consequently prohibits the leptogenesis mechanism to work successfully. For these models, we study the scenario that the desired right-handed neutrino mass splittings for leptogenesis to work are generated from the renormalization-group running effects. In such a scenario, we explore the parameter space that allows for the reproduction of the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Boosting probes of CP violation in the top Yukawa coupling with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the top-Higgs coupling is crucial in particle physics, offering insights into potential new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) carrying {\cal CP} Violation (CPV) effects. In this paper, we explore the {\cal CP} properties of a Higgs boson coupling with a top quark pair, focusing on events where the Higgs state decays into a pair of $b$-quarks and the top-antitop system decays leptonically. The novelty of our analysis resides in the exploitation of two conditional Deep Learning (DL) networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Graph Convolution Network (GCN). These models are trained for selected CPV phase values and then used to interpolate all possible values ranging from $0$ to $\pi/2$. This enables a comprehensive assessment of sensitivity across all {\cal CP} phase values, thereby streamlining the process as the models are trained only once. Notably, the conditional GCN exhibits superior performance over the conditional MLP, owing to the nature of graph-based Neural Network (NN) structures. Specifically, for Higgs top coupling modifier set to 1, with $\sqrt{s}= 13.6$ TeV and integrated luminosity of $3$ ab$^{-1}$ GCN excludes the {\cal CP} phase larger than $5^\circ$ at $95.4\%$ Confidence Level (C.L). Our Machine Learning (ML) informed findings indicate that assessment of the {\cal CP} properties of the Higgs coupling to the $t\bar t$ pair can be within reach of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), quantitatively surpassing the sensitivity of more traditional approaches.</description>

Abstract: We propose a solar production mechanism of MeV dark matter to overcome the energy threshold in direct detection experiments. In particular, the proton and deuteron fussion to ${}^3 \mathrm{He}$ of the $pp$ chain that produces energetic neutrino and gamma photon with 5.5$\,$MeV of energy release can also produce a pair of dark matter particles. Besides, we establish an analytical formalism of using the Boltzmann equation to study the solar attenuation effect on the produced dark matter flux. The projected sensitivity is illustrated with Argon target at the DarkSide-LowMass experiment.</description>

Abstract: The comparable abundances of dark matter and baryons imply a deep connection between the dark sector and the QCD sector. In models of asymmetric dark matter, the number densities of both sectors are ensured to be similar. However, a complete solution should also include a mechanism for comparable masses. In this letter, we present a solution based on a strongly coupled chiral dark sector, featuring a light composite fermion as the dark matter. Its mass is generated through the misalignment triggered by the QCD vacuum, ensuring the mass to be at the GeV scale. The model features $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV dark baryon dark matter together with dark pions (axion-like particles). Moreover, a composite QCD axion naturally arise in the UV model.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are critical theoretical inputs for long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. However, robust modeling of these cross sections remains challenging. For a simple but physically motivated toy model of the DUNE experiment, we demonstrate that an accurate neural-network model of the cross section -- leveraging only Standard-Model symmetries -- can be learned from near-detector data. We perform a neutrino oscillation analysis with simulated far-detector events, finding that oscillation analysis results enabled by our data-driven cross-section model approach the theoretical limit achievable with perfect prior knowledge of the cross section. We further quantify the effects of flux shape and detector resolution uncertainties as well as systematics from cross-section mismodeling. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of future neutrino near-detector datasets and data-driven cross-section models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Mountains: current-carrying domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term ``spherons.'' This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</description>

      <title>Axion forces in axion backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of an (approximate) shift symmetry. Because of their pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force mediated by the axion at tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to observable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. At the one-loop level, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent force. This force is coherently enhanced in the presence of an axion background. In this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion background. We find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a crucial role in determining this force. The background-induced axion force $V_{\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. The shift symmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or effectively by the axion background. When the shift symmetry is broken, $V_{\rm bkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation number of the background axions. We investigate possible experimental probes of this effect in two distinct scenarios: an axion dark matter background and a solar axion flux, using fifth-force searches and atomic spectroscopy experiments. In the axion dark matter case, we find that the background-induced axion force can place strong constraints on axion couplings and masses, comparable to existing astrophysical bounds.</description>

      <title>Insights into the highest natural scale: Finite naturalness challenges inflationary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the criterion of finite naturalness to the limiting case of a generic heavy sector decoupled from the Standard Model. The sole and unavoidable exception to this decoupling arises from gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that gravity can couple the Higgs to the heavy scale significantly earlier than the well-known three-loop top-quark-mediated diagrams discussed in previous literature. As an application, we show that finite naturalness disfavors large-field inflationary models involving super-Planckian field excursions. In contrast, in the small-field regime, achieving successful inflation requires substantial fine-tuning of the initial conditions, in agreement with previous results. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope further amplify the tension between naturalness and fine-tuning, challenging the theoretical robustness of single-field inflation as a compelling explanation for the origin of the universe.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy for $\pi^+ p$ elastic scattering using spin-density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\pi^+ p$ elastic scattering process using an effective Lagrangian approach that incorporates the $s$-, $u$-, and $t$-channel amplitudes, including $\Delta^{++}(1232)$, $\Delta^{0}(1232)$, neutron, and $\rho^0$ contributions. By constructing the spin-density matrices from the scattering amplitudes, we derive the von Neumann (entanglement) entropy associated with the spin degrees of freedom of the initial and final state particles. We compute the entropy by performing a partial trace over the spin subsystems, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of the center-of-mass energy $W$ and scattering angle $\theta$. We find that entropy exhibits nontrivial angular and energy dependences, reflecting the interplay among resonance contributions and background amplitudes. In particular, the $\Delta^{++}$ region shows relatively low entanglement, suggesting spin coherence dominated by the specific resonant contribution, while the background contributions increase entropy due to mixed spin configurations. These results indicate that entanglement entropy can serve as a novel probe into the quantum structure of hadronic scattering amplitudes, providing complementary insights beyond conventional cross-section analyses.</description>

      <title>QCD antenna radiative spectrum in dense media within the Improved Opacity Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the double differential inclusive spectrum for the emission of a soft gluon from a color-singlet $q\bar q$ pair traversing a dense QCD medium. Our results extend the existing literature by simultaneously incorporating both single hard and multiple soft gluon exchanges between the jet and the medium -- an essential ingredient for a complete phenomenological description of jet quenching. Using the Improved Opacity Expansion framework, we provide an analytically tractable treatment, reducing the full cross-section to a set of simple expressions. Our analysis demonstrates that rare hard (Moli\`ere) scatterings significantly modify the gluon spectrum at large angles, accelerating the loss of color coherence between the initial quarks. We further quantify whether the modifications are driven by an overall weakening of the interference term, or by more detailed modifications to the fragmentation pattern. Our results provide a direct input for phenomenological jet quenching studies, offering new insights into the role of color decoherence in QCD matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of massless fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if we consider freeze-in of Dark Walker coupled to the Standard Model through the Higgs portal. This provides a simple yet predictive example linking strongly coupled inflationary dynamics to present-day dark matter.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric figure of merit and the deconfinement phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoelectric phenomena are traditionally associated with the interconversion of thermal and electrical energy in many-body systems. In the context of high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thermoelectric responses can provide insight into the evolving microscopic dynamics and the redistribution of effective degrees of freedom across the phase transition region. In this work, for the first time, we present a phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit (\( ZT \)) in hot QCD matter, with a particular focus on its behavior across the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. Using model-based calculations for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, we analyze the temperature dependence of \( ZT \) and identify characteristic features near the QCD phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that \( ZT \) exhibits nontrivial behavior near the transition region, reflecting the changing transport properties and active degrees of freedom in the medium. This phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit provides a complementary perspective to traditional transport studies and may provide critical insights for advancing the understanding of QCD matter through the transition region.</description>

      <title>Detection of Dark Matter Axions via the Quantum Hall Effect in a Resonant Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for detecting dark matter axions using a resonant cavity coupled with a quantum Hall system. When a sample exhibiting quantum Hall effect is placed inside the cavity and the cavity is tuned to resonance, two-dimensional electrons absorb the amplified radiation, leading to a rise in the sample's temperature. By monitoring this temperature increase, the mass $m_a$ of the axion can be inferred. As an example, consider a GaAs sample with small thickness $d = 0.1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ and its heat capacity $C_s$ at temperature $T = 20\,\mathrm{mK}$. According to the QCD axion model, because the energy flux of the incoming radiation is $P_{ra}\sim 10^{-18}g_{\gamma}^2\mbox{W cm}^{-2}(10^{-5}\mbox{eV}/m_a)(B/1.5\times 10^5\mbox{Gauss})^2 (\rho_d/0.3\rm GeV cm^{-3})$ at the resonance with $g_{\gamma}(\rm KSVZ)=-0.96$ and $g_{\gamma}(\rm DFSZ)=0.37$, the temperature increase $(P_{ra}/C_s)\times \tau$ is approximately $\simeq 0.25(\mbox{mK})(\tau/10\mbox{ms})\,g_{\gamma}^2\,(20\mbox{mK}/T)^3(10^{-5}\mbox{eV}/m_a)(B/1.5\times 10^5\mbox{Gauss})^2(0.1\mu \mbox{m}/d)$, where $\tau$ is the time constant associated with the heat dissipation into thermal bath.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of the two-loop corrections controlled by the BSM Higgs couplings on the cross section for the production of a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons via gluon fusion in the aligned THDM. To this aim, we reassess the two-loop calculation of $\lambda_{hhh}$, we compute for the first time the two-loop corrections to $\lambda_{hhH}$, and we include the relevant corrections to the Higgs-gluon couplings and to the s-channel propagators entering the $gg \rightarrow hh$ amplitude. We discuss the numerical impact of the two-loop BSM contributions, first on the individual couplings and then on the prediction for the pair-production cross section, in two benchmark scenarios for the aligned THDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a geometric representation of the CP phases $\delta_{\rm PDG}$ and $\delta_{\rm KM}$ in the PDG and Kobayashi--Maskawa parameterizations of the flavor mixing matrix in the complex plane. The sum rule with the unitarity triangle $\delta_{\rm PDG} + \delta_{\rm KM} = \pi - \alpha + \gamma$ is expressed as a quadrangle, which is a combination of a unitarity triangle and an alternative triangle. Through the unitarity quadrangle, the CP phases are also identified with specific geometric angles. Furthermore, a new set of inverse unitarity triangles is defined from the inversion formula of a unitary matrix $U^{\dagger} = U^{-1}$. These novel triangles contain standard angles of the form $\arg [U_{\alpha i } U_{\beta j} U_{\alpha j}^{*} U_{\beta i}^{*}]$ and new angles $\arg [U_{\alpha i } U_{\beta j} U_{\gamma k} / \det U]$, which directly determine nontrivial arguments of the mixing matrix elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study basis-independent structures in the Type-I seesaw mechanism for light Majorana neutrinos, assuming the canonical scenario with three heavy right-handed (sterile) neutrinos. Let $m_\nu$ denote the $3\times3$ mass matrix of light neutrinos, obtained at tree level from heavy Majorana singlets with diagonal mass matrix $D_N = \mathrm{diag}(M_1,M_2,M_3)$ and Dirac matrix $m_D$. We show that all right-actions $F$ on the seesaw matrix that leave $m_\nu$ unchanged form the group $G = D_N^{1/2} O(3,\mathbb{C}) D_N^{-1/2}$. While oscillation data determine the PMNS matrix $U_{\rm PMNS}$ and the mass-squared splittings, they do not fix the $F$-class within $G$. We classify basis-invariant quantities into those that are class-blind (e.g.\ $\det\eta$) and class-sensitive (e.g. $\mathrm{Tr}\,\eta$, $\mathrm{Tr}\,\eta^2$, an alignment measure, and CP-odd traces relevant to leptogenesis), where $\eta$ denotes the non-unitarity matrix of the light sector. We provide explicit formulas and both high-scale and GeV-scale benchmark examples that illustrate these invariant fingerprints and their scaling with $D_N$. This converts the degeneracy at fixed $m_\nu$ into measurable, basis-invariant fingerprints.</description>

Abstract: Identified-hadron (PID) spectra from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb and $p$-$p$ collisions are analyzed via a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in high-energy nuclear collisions. The Pb-Pb TCM is adopted with minor changes from a recent analysis of PID hadron spectra from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions. The object of study is evidence for jet suppression in small and large collision systems as indicating quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation there. Conventional methods have included Pb-Pb centrality determination via classical Glauber model and evidence for high-$p_t$ suppression sought via spectrum ratio $R_\text{AA}$. In the present study alternative geometry determination via ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ data reveals that the number of participant nucleons in central Pb-Pb collisions is about 1/3 of the Glauber estimate. Based on certain features of Pb-Pb spectra the validity of the factorization assumption is also questioned. The entire jet contribution is therefore treated without factorization in ratio to a $p$-$p$ spectrum model as reference. The new results indicate that exclusivity and time dilation (experienced by participant partons) play an essential role in jet production not incorporated in Glauber model or hard-component factorization. The combination determines an effective number of N-N collisions per participant nucleon given specific Pb-Pb centrality. The effect on parton fragment (jet) distributions on $p_t$ is similar to projectile-proton fragment distributions on pseudorapidity from fixed-target $p$-A experiments where low-$\eta$ densities scale with A while high-$\eta$ densities are consistent with $p$-$p$ collisions. $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb spectra similarly analyzed reflect the same physics given different geometries. Jet suppression related to QGP formation is not evident.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the phenomenological aspects of a feebly interacting sterile neutrino dark matter candidate within a low-scale seesaw framework. The Type-I seesaw model is augmented by a second complex scalar doublet ($\Phi_{\nu}$), which couples exclusively to the heavy right-handed neutrinos and the lepton doublet, thereby generating the neutrino Dirac mass term while the first scalar doublet is responsible for giving mass to the remaining Standard Model particles. The lightest sterile neutrino ($N_1$) acts as a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP), produced via decays of $W^\pm$, $Z$ and extra scalars present in the setup. We point out that $W^\pm$ and $Z$ contributions were overlooked in the previous studies, which actually dominate the $N_1$ production by a factor of $\sim 10^{13}$ and solely determines the relic abundance. Incorporating them leads to several novel consequences for the DM phenomenology like a new non-thermal condition which leads to smaller Yukawa couplings. We thoroughly discuss about the enhancement possibilities of $N_1$'s mass which is controlled by the small vacuum expectation value ($v_{\nu}$) of the second Higgs doublet. After incorporating the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations, this setup can accommodate both warm and cold dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electroweak corrections to $gg\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the electroweak corrections for the production of a photon pair through gluon fusion, focusing on the contribution from the first two generations of quarks. The two-loop amplitude is calculated using a series of projection operators which define scalar form factors. In order to evaluate the Master Integrals which appear in this process we employ both generalized polylogarithms and Chen-iterated integrals. In order to perform a phenomenological study we develop a semi-numerical evaluation of the Master Integrals employing a fitting procedure to speed up the evaluation of burdensome higher weight contributions. We present results for the LHC, finding corrections of around a couple of percent to the leading order $gg \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ process. Our results are implemented into the parton-level Monte Carlo code \texttt{MCFM}.</description>

      <title>Implications of portal vector-like lepton on associated Higgs production at a multi-TeV muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have explored a portal vector-like lepton (pVLL) extension of the Standard Model (SM) and studied its implications for Higgs and vector-boson associated production ($hV$, with $~V = Z$-boson or dark photon) at a future muon collider facility. We show that while the $~\mu^+ \mu^- \to hZ~$ production rate remains close to its SM prediction in a wide range of parameter space, the rate for $~\mu^+ \mu^- \to h\gamma_d~$ can be substantially enhanced owing to the non-decoupling nature of the interaction involving the heavy lepton, the muon and the dark photon. We demonstrate that the $h\gamma_d$ production rate can exceed the corresponding $hZ$ rate by a factor of $1$-$100$ within the perturbative unitarity limit, making it a promising channel for probing Higgs interactions and potential new physics effects.
  Furthermore, this process can also be used to constrain the dark photon mass ($m_{\gamma_d}$) and/or the dark gauge coupling ($g_d$) consistent with the current muon $g-2$ measurements within the pVLL framework. We perform a detailed collider analysis of the $h\gamma_d$ process in the $b\bar{b}~+$ missing energy final state. A $2\sigma$ exclusion limit for $m_{\gamma_d}$ up to $80$ GeV is obtained assuming $~g_d=0.05$, $~\sin\theta_L=4\times10^{-5}$, $~\sin\theta_s=0.05$, for a heavy lepton mass $~\sim 3$ TeV at a $3$ TeV muon collider with an integrated luminosity of $1$ ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>NLO heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions in the ACOT scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of heavy-quark contributions to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_4$ and $F_5$ within the Aivazis--Collins--Olness--Tung (ACOT) scheme, implemented in the open source library \texttt{APFEL++} using \texttt{CT18NLO} parton distribution functions. These structure functions, suppressed by lepton mass effects in light-lepton processes, become significant in muon, tau-lepton and neutrino scattering at facilities such as SHiP, IceCube, and DUNE. Our results reveal NLO corrections up to 10\% relative to leading order, with pronounced heavy-quark effects at low Bjorken-$x$, impacting gluon and strange quark distributions. In the unpolarized case, $F_{4/5}^{\gamma Z}$ and $F_{4/5}^{\gamma}$ do not contribute to the cross section, while the $\gamma Z$ interference becomes accessible with longitudinally polarized lepton beams at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), offering enhanced sensitivity at low $Q^2$ due to reduced $Z$-boson propagator suppression. Analytical NLO expressions have also been derived for the polarized structure functions $g_1$, $g_4$, $g_5$, $g_6$, and $g_7$ in the ACOT framework. These developments enable precise theoretical predictions for upcoming experimental programs and global QCD analyses.</description>

      <title>Flavored QCD axion and Modular invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A four-dimensional effective model with $G_{\rm SM}\times SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times U(1)_X$ is proposed in string-derived supergravity framework, where $G_{\rm SM}$ is the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and $U(1)_X$ is gauged. We show $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$- and $U(1)_X$-mixed anomalies should vanish. Anomalies induced by K{\"a}hler transformations match those from gaugino chiral rotations. When SM fermions transform nontrivially under $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and with vanishing gaugino contributions, the anomaly-free conditions are powerful enough to determine the quark and lepton flavor structures, set scales for $U(1)_X$ breaking, and ensure the strong CP phase remains unmodified. While the Green-Schwarz coefficient $\delta^{\rm GS}_X$ is generically non-zero, vanishing $U(1)_X$ anomalies cause gauge boson decoupling and $\delta^{\rm GS}_X\rightarrow 0$, yielding a massless global $U(1)_X$ without a Nambu-Goldstone mode. We show that the modulus vacuum expectation value stabilizes near $\langle\tau\rangle \approx i$, where exact $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ ($T$-duality) is spontaneously broken, removing residual modular symmetry. The framework predicts seesaw-generated neutrino masses and flavored axion properties, with all Yukawa coefficients constrained to unit-magnitude complex numbers. Our model reproduces current quark and lepton data, predicts an axion mass $m_a\approx0.9\times10^{-2}$ eV and photon coupling $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}|\approx1.7\times10^{-13}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, and unlike the ordinary case, suppresses flavor-violating axion couplings to $s,d$ quarks and $\mu,e$ leptons to $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^4)$ (with $\lambda$ the Cabibbo angle). It also yields normal neutrino mass hierarchy consistent with oscillation data, $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay rate, and cosmological and astrophysical measurements.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Complex Singlet Model with Phase Transition Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Dark matter implications from the XENONnT and LZ data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a possible dark matter origin of the high-energy nuclear-recoil-like events in XENONnT and LZ data, which cannot be explained by standard elastic spin-independent WIMP scattering. Using our unified DIAMX framework, built on openly available data and likelihood models, we perform the first combined profile-likelihood fits to multiple WIMP-search datasets with a total exposure of 7.3 tonne$\times$year. We investigate that two broad classes of dark matter nucleon interactions, with velocity-dependent cross-section or inelastic (endo- and exothermic) scattering, can reproduce the observed high-energy recoil spectrum, reaching local significances up to $4\sigma$. We further quantify the impact of $^{124}$Xe double electron capture (DEC) backgrounds, finding that variations in the poorly known DEC charge yields can shift the inferred significances from below $1\sigma$ to $4\sigma$. We point out that extending the same analysis to XENONnT and LZ data with recoil energies up to 300 keV, once available, will provide a powerful test of the dark matter interpretation, since the $^{124}$Xe DEC background is expected to be negligible in this high-energy range.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes versus potentials in nuclear effective field theory: search for a potential compromise</title>

      <description>arXiv:1902.08172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In effective field theory physical quantities, in particular observables, are expressed as a power series in terms of a small expansion parameter. For non-perturbative systems, for instance nuclear physics, this requires the non-perturbative treatment of at least part of the interaction (or the potential, if one is dealing with a non-relativistic system), while the rest of the interaction is included as perturbations. This is not entirely trivial and as a consequence different interpretations on how to treat these systems have appeared. A practical approach is to expand the effective potential, where this potential is later fully iterated in the Schroedinger equation for obtaining amplitudes and observables. The expectation is that this will lead to observables that will have an implicit power counting expansion. Here I explicitly check whether the amplitudes (when expanded according to the counting) are actually following the same power counting as the potential. It happens that reality does not necessarily conform to expectations and the amplitudes will sometimes violate the power counting with which the potential has been expanded. A more formal approach is to formulate the expansion directly in terms of amplitudes and observables, which is the original aim of the effective field theory idea. Yet this second approach is technically complicated. I explore here the possibility of constructing potentials that when fully iterated will make sure that amplitudes are indeed expansible in terms of a small expansion parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls are topological defects produced by the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of discrete symmetry during cosmological phase transitions. Domain walls can significantly contribute to the energy density in the late-evolution stage. We propose that the density perturbations from the fluctuations in the number density of the domain walls could collapse to form primordial black holes. This mechanism becomes effective when the domain wall energy density ratio to that of the radiation reaches about 0.1 in the radiation-dominated Universe. We find that models with $Z_2$ symmetry are excluded for interpreting pulsar timing array observations on the nano-Hz gravitational wave background since this model's domain wall number density fluctuations could lead to an overabundance of the primordial black holes. Moreover, the models, which generate approximately $N\sim 10$ domain walls from the spontaneous breaking of a discrete $Z_N$ symmetry, are also subject to stringent constraints due to the overproduction of primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: The study of ultralight dark matter helps to constrain the lower bound of the mass in minimally coupled dark matter models. The granular structure of ultralight dark matter density fields produces metric perturbations which have been identified as a potentially interesting probe of this model. For dark matter masses $m \gtrsim 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$, these perturbations would fluctuate on timescales comparable to observational timescales. In this paper, we estimate the expected time delay these fluctuations would generate in simulated pulsar signals. We simulate arrays of mock pulsars in a fluctuating granular density field. We calculate the expected Shapiro time delay, gravitational redshift, and Doppler shift and compare analytical estimates with the results of simulations. Finally, we provide a comparison with existing pulsar observation sensitivities.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and systematic method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. We introduce a window function to account for the relevant perturbation scales associated with PBHs of different masses, along with a filter function that removes unphysical contributions from super-horizon-scale overdensities. While some uncertainties remain due to the limited understanding of the nonlinear collapse process, our approach substantially reduces the discrepancy previously observed between peaks theory and the Press-Schechter formalism.</description>

Abstract: The study of symmetry plane correlations (SPCs) can be useful in characterizing the direction of the anisotropic emission of produced particles in the final state. The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlations measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations, and a qualitative match has been found between them. These event-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce the presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution, thus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among other applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter Archaeology with Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\sim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\neq f_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. In scenarios where such a blue tilt is present, the enhanced GW signal allows future interferometers to place non-trivial constraints on the parameters $m_Q$ and $f_a$, thereby complementing haloscope searches. While some degeneracies with other parameters such as $m_Q$ remain, detectors such as BBO and ET will be able to optimistically probe $f_a\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Strangeness production in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=7$ TeV using various model approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the predictions of various observables for strange ($\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm S}$, $\Lambda$($\overline{\Lambda}$)) and multi-strange hadrons ($\Xi^-$($\overline{\Xi}^+$), $\phi$, and $\Omega^-$($\overline{\Omega}^+$)) using the recently updated 3+1D hydrodynamics-based EPOS4 framework and AMPT model. In this study, we report the transverse momentum (${p_{\rm T}}$) spectra, particle yields (${\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}y}$), and ${p_{\rm T}}$ integrated yield ratios relative to pions for $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=7$~TeV. The results reveal that there are indications of stronger radial flow in EPOS4 compared to AMPT. We observe a final state multiplicity overlap with small ($p+p$ and $p+Pb$) and large ($Pb+Pb$) collision systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry breaking in Georgi-Glashow chiral-gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical symmetry breaking in a class of chiral gauge theories containing the Georgi-Glashow model. These theories feature a gauge sector and two fermion species that transform in the two-index antisymmetric and antifundamental representations with different multiplicities. Using the effective action formalism and the functional renormalization group, we derive the flow of four-fermion interactions that encode their resonant structure and information about bound-state formation. Generalizing the theories to multiple generations, we make contact with the loss of asymptotic freedom and dissect the boundary of a conjectured conformal window. Our results show that, while most of the theory space displays a dominant color-breaking condensate, there exists a strongly coupled regime where the lowest-laying mechanisms fail and more intricate dynamics are expected to arise. This analysis provides a first step toward the infrared behavior of chiral gauge theories with functional methods.</description>

      <title>Disformal interactions in the Dark Sector: From driving Early Dark Energy to confronting cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite formulation of quantum field theory based on a system of differential equations reminiscent of the Callan-Symanzik equations is discussed. This system of equations was previously formulated in the bare language. We rederive it in a fully renormalized language. For the latter, within a simple $\phi^4$ toy model, it is shown that with a specific choice of renormalization conditions - namely, the on-shell scheme for the renormalized mass - this class of finite renormalization prescriptions is equivalent to the standard renormalization-group equation written in the Callan-Symanzik-Ovsyannikov form.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantum Gravity with Gravitational Waves from the ringdown of binary Black Holes coalescences: A New Frontier in Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future, the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>

      <title>Locality constraints in AdS$_2$ without parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.</description>
