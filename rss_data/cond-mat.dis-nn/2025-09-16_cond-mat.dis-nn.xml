      <title>Quantum Otto heat engine and quantum Mpemba effect in quasiperiodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a quasiperiodic system with off-diagonal and diagonal modulations is studied. By analyzing the inverse participation ratio and the centroid position of the wave packet, the delocalization-localization phase diagrams in the equilibrium state and the non-equilibrium steady state are obtained respectively. The stability of the system's initial state on dissipation and the dissipation-driven delocalization-localization transition (or vice versa) are discussed. The dynamic evolution behavior provides evidence for the existence of the quantum Mpemba effect in this dissipation-modulated system. A starting-line hypothesis is proposed, which can be used to explain the occurrence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect. In addition, the thermodynamic applications of this system have also been studied. The results prove that the localized phase is beneficial to the realization of quantum heater as well. Our work has promoted the understanding of the steady-state phase transitions and dynamic behaviors of dissipation-modulated quasiperiodic systems, and has expanded the existing thermodynamic research on the application of quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>Instant prediction of relaxation in moir\'{e} superlattices using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation of moir\'e superlattices in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been modeled using a set of neural-network-based approaches. We implemented and compared several architectures, including (i) an interpolator combined with an autoencoder, (ii) an interpolator combined with a decoder, (iii) a direct generator mapping input parameters to displacement fields, and (iv) a physics-informed neural network (PINN). Among these, the direct generator architecture demonstrated the best performance, achieving machine-level precision with minimal training data. Remarkably, once trained, this simple fully connected network is able to predict the full displacement field of a moir\'e bilayer within a fraction of a second, whereas conventional continuum simulations require hours or even days. This finding highlights the low-dimensional nature of the relaxation process and establishes neural networks as a practical and efficient alternative to ab initio approaches for rapid modeling and high-throughput screening of 2D twisted heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and optimization within autoregressive neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful variational ans\"atze capable of representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQS such as recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>
