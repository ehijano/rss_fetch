      <title>Systole-Conditioned Generative Cardiac Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate motion estimation in cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging is critical for assessing cardiac function and surgical planning. Data-driven methods have become the standard approach for dense motion estimation, but they rely on vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth (GT) motion annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations.
  Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle. These pairs serve as fully annotated data samples, providing optical flow GT annotations. Our data generation pipeline could enable the training and validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models, allowing for substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations.
  Our code, along with animated generated samples and additional material, is available on our project page: https://shaharzuler.github.io/GenerativeCardiacMotion_Page.</description>

      <title>Quantization-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture for Efficient Skin Disease Classification on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference. Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6\% Top-1 accuracy and 82.4\% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8\% / 81.7\% on the clinical dataset, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5\,ms inference latency and 1.7\,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and energy use by over 94.6\%/98.6\% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical analysis in edge environments.</description>

      <title>MLRU++: Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ with Attention for Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial but challenging due to anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric data. Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of 87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components. Results suggest that MLRU++ offers a practical and high-performing solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Source code is available at: https://github.com/1027865/MLRUPP</description>

      <title>SFNet: A Spatial-Frequency Domain Deep Learning Network for Efficient Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16267v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Neural Network for Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been proposed for solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs), but most of them heavily rely on data and suffer from limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, a new solving scheme is proposed where the solution is iteratively updated following the updating of the physics-driven neural network (PDNN), the hyperparameters of which are optimized by minimizing the loss function which incorporates the constraints from the collected scattered fields and the prior information about scatterers. Unlike data-driven neural network solvers, PDNN is trained only requiring the input of collected scattered fields and the computation of scattered fields corresponding to predicted solutions, thus avoids the generalization problem. Moreover, to accelerate the imaging efficiency, the subregion enclosing the scatterers is identified. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high reconstruction accuracy and strong stability, even when dealing with composite lossy scatterers.</description>

      <title>A High Magnifications Histopathology Image Dataset for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Diagnosis and Prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy where deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis can enhance clinical assessments.However, existing publicly available OSCC datasets often suffer from limited patient cohorts and a restricted focus on either diagnostic or prognostic tasks, limiting the development of comprehensive and generalizable models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new histopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both diagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each patient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the core and edge tumor regions.The Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six critical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis (LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE), and perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically evaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our analysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve excellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and 81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3) Multi-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to single-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of balancing multiple tasks in our dataset. To accelerate future research, we publicly release the Multi-OSCC dataset and baseline models at https://github.com/guanjinquan/OSCC-PathologyImageDataset.</description>

      <title>Semantic Segmentation for Preoperative Planning in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When preoperative planning for surgeries is conducted on the basis of medical images, artificial intelligence methods can support medical doctors during assessment. In this work, we consider medical guidelines for preoperative planning of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and identify tasks, that may be supported via semantic segmentation models by making relevant anatomical structures measurable in computed tomography scans. We first derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained anatomical information, in order to train segmentation models and quantify how well they are able to find these structures in the scans. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation to the loss function in training these segmentation models and through this achieve a +1.27% Dice increase in performance. Our fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels and the computed tomography scans we build upon are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16274176.</description>

      <title>Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model for Imaging Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers. Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows significant advantages over other methods.

      <title>A Tutorial on MRI Reconstruction: From Modern Methods to Clinical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI is an indispensable clinical tool, offering a rich variety of tissue contrasts to support broad diagnostic and research applications. Clinical exams routinely acquire multiple structural sequences that provide complementary information for differential diagnosis, while research protocols often incorporate advanced functional, diffusion, spectroscopic, and relaxometry sequences to capture multidimensional insights into tissue structure and composition. However, these capabilities come at the cost of prolonged scan times, which reduce patient throughput, increase susceptibility to motion artifacts, and may require trade-offs in image quality or diagnostic scope. Over the last two decades, advances in image reconstruction algorithms--alongside improvements in hardware and pulse sequence design--have made it possible to accelerate acquisitions while preserving diagnostic quality. Central to this progress is the ability to incorporate prior information to regularize the solutions to the reconstruction problem. In this tutorial, we overview the basics of MRI reconstruction and highlight state-of-the-art approaches, beginning with classical methods that rely on explicit hand-crafted priors, and then turning to deep learning methods that leverage a combination of learned and crafted priors to further push the performance envelope. We also explore the translational aspects and eventual clinical implications of these methods. We conclude by discussing future directions to address remaining challenges in MRI reconstruction. The tutorial is accompanied by a Python toolbox (https://github.com/tutorial-MRI-recon/tutorial) to demonstrate select methods discussed in the article.</description>

      <title>Improving U-Net Confidence on TEM Image Data with L2-Regularization, Transfer Learning, and Deep Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for natural images.
  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization, semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate, which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.</description>

      <title>MultiTaskDeltaNet: Change Detection-based Image Segmentation for Operando ETEM with Application to Carbon Gasification Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging into a tool for spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions requires automated, high-precision semantic segmentation of dynamically evolving features. However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic segmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data, visually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning architecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change detection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net backbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN utilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between physical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ environmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN demonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models, particularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models in predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges several key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis, advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Optimization of DNN-based HSI Segmentation FPGA-based SoC for ADS: A Practical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked, must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Signet ring cells (SRCs), associated with a high propensity for peripheral metastasis and poor prognosis, critically influence surgical decision-making and outcome prediction. However, their detection remains challenging even for experienced pathologists. While artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated SRC diagnosis has gained increasing attention for its potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, existing methodologies lack systematic review. This gap impedes the assessment of disparities between algorithmic capabilities and clinical applicability. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven SRC analysis from 2008 through June 2025. We systematically summarize the biological characteristics of SRCs and challenges in their automated identification. Representative algorithms are analyzed and categorized as unimodal or multi-modal approaches. Unimodal algorithms, encompassing image, omics, and text data, are reviewed; image-based ones are further subdivided into classification, detection, segmentation, and foundation model tasks. Multi-modal algorithms integrate two or more data modalities (images, omics, and text). Finally, by evaluating current methodological performance against clinical assistance requirements, we discuss unresolved challenges and future research directions in SRC analysis. This survey aims to assist researchers, particularly those without medical backgrounds, in understanding the landscape of SRC analysis and the prospects for intelligent diagnosis, thereby accelerating the translation of computational algorithms into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>FLLIC: Functionally Lossless Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, DNN models for lossless image coding have surpassed their traditional counterparts in compression performance, reducing the previous lossless bit rate by about ten percent for natural color images. But even with these advances, mathematically lossless image compression (MLLIC) ratios for natural images still fall short of the bandwidth and cost-effectiveness requirements of most practical imaging and vision systems at present and beyond. To overcome the performance barrier of MLLIC, we question the very necessity of MLLIC. Considering that all digital imaging sensors suffer from acquisition noises, why should we insist on mathematically lossless coding, i.e., wasting bits to preserve noises? Instead, we propose a new paradigm of joint denoising and compression called functionally lossless image compression (FLLIC), which performs lossless compression of optimally denoised images (the optimality may be task-specific). Although not literally lossless with respect to the noisy input, FLLIC aims to achieve the best possible reconstruction of the latent noise-free original image. Extensive experiments show that FLLIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint denoising and compression of noisy images and does so at a lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Inference Machine for Medical Image Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image registration is essential for medical image applications where alignment of voxels across multiple images is needed for qualitative or quantitative analysis. With recent advancements in deep neural networks and parallel computing, deep learning-based medical image registration methods become competitive with their flexible modelling and fast inference capabilities. However, compared to traditional optimization-based registration methods, the speed advantage may come at the cost of registration performance at inference time. Besides, deep neural networks ideally demand large training datasets while optimization-based methods are training-free. To improve registration accuracy and data efficiency, we propose a novel image registration method, termed Recurrent Inference Image Registration (RIIR) network. RIIR is formulated as a meta-learning solver to the registration problem in an iterative manner. RIIR addresses the accuracy and data efficiency issues, by learning the update rule of optimization, with implicit regularization combined with explicit gradient input.
  We evaluated RIIR extensively on brain MRI and quantitative cardiac MRI datasets, in terms of both registration accuracy and training data efficiency. Our experiments showed that RIIR outperformed a range of deep learning-based methods, even with only $5\%$ of the training data, demonstrating high data efficiency. Key findings from our ablation studies highlighted the important added value of the hidden states introduced in the recurrent inference framework for meta-learning. Our proposed RIIR offers a highly data-efficient framework for deep learning-based medical image registration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral sensing is a valuable tool for detecting anomalies and distinguishing between materials in a scene. Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HS-AD) helps characterize the captured scenes and separates them into anomaly and background classes. It is vital in agriculture, environment, and military applications such as RSTA (reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition) missions. We previously designed an equal voting ensemble of hyperspectral unmixing and three unsupervised HS-AD algorithms. We later utilized a supervised classifier to determine the weights of a voting ensemble, creating a hybrid of heterogeneous unsupervised HS-AD algorithms with a supervised classifier in a model stacking, which improved detection accuracy. However, supervised classification methods usually fail to detect novel or unknown patterns that substantially deviate from those seen previously. In this work, we evaluate our technique and other supervised and unsupervised methods using general hyperspectral data to provide new insights.</description>

      <title>EndoControlMag: Robust Endoscopic Vascular Motion Magnification with Periodic Reference Resetting and Hierarchical Tissue-aware Dual-Mask Contro</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations. Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness across challenging surgical conditions. The code, dataset, and video results are available at https://szupc.github.io/EndoControlMag/.</description>

      <title>DeSamba: Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Framework for 3D Multi-Sequence MRI Lesion Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency domain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in medical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for robust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose DeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel framework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse spatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a Decoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from different MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction, and a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet, enabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion characteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On a six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1 accuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external validation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On a spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification task, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal and external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that both DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over 10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the potential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion classification in multi-sequence medical imaging.</description>

      <title>DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08005v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Affordance Grounding of Deformable Objects in Egocentric Organizing Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deformable object manipulation in robotics presents significant challenges due to uncertainties in component properties, diverse configurations, visual interference, and ambiguous prompts. These factors complicate both perception and control tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method for One-Shot Affordance Grounding of Deformable Objects (OS-AGDO) in egocentric organizing scenes, enabling robots to recognize previously unseen deformable objects with varying colors and shapes using minimal samples. Specifically, we first introduce the Deformable Object Semantic Enhancement Module (DefoSEM), which enhances hierarchical understanding of the internal structure and improves the ability to accurately identify local features, even under conditions of weak component information. Next, we propose the ORB-Enhanced Keypoint Fusion Module (OEKFM), which optimizes feature extraction of key components by leveraging geometric constraints and improves adaptability to diversity and visual interference. Additionally, we propose an instance-conditional prompt based on image data and task context, which effectively mitigates the issue of region ambiguity caused by prompt words. To validate these methods, we construct a diverse real-world dataset, AGDDO15, which includes 15 common types of deformable objects and their associated organizational actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 6.2%, 3.2%, and 2.9% in KLD, SIM, and NSS metrics, respectively, while exhibiting high generalization performance.

      <title>Unveiling the Potential of Segment Anything Model 2 for RGB-Thermal Semantic Segmentation with Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perception capability of robotic systems relies on the richness of the dataset. Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), trained on large datasets, demonstrates strong perception potential in perception tasks, its inherent training paradigm prevents it from being suitable for RGB-T tasks. To address these challenges, we propose SHIFNet, a novel SAM2-driven Hybrid Interaction Paradigm that unlocks the potential of SAM2 with linguistic guidance for efficient RGB-Thermal perception. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Fusion (SACF) module that dynamically balances modality contributions through text-guided affinity learning, overcoming SAM2's inherent RGB bias; (2) Heterogeneous Prompting Decoder (HPD) that enhances global semantic information through a semantic enhancement module and then combined with category embeddings to amplify cross-modal semantic consistency. With 32.27M trainable parameters, SHIFNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on public benchmarks, reaching 89.8% on PST900 and 67.8% on FMB, respectively. The framework facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained large models to RGB-T segmentation tasks, effectively mitigating the high costs associated with data collection while endowing robotic systems with comprehensive perception capabilities. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/iAsakiT3T/SHIFNet.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Joint Learning of Optical Flow and Intensity with Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras rely on motion to obtain information about scene appearance. This means that appearance and motion are inherently linked: either both are present and recorded in the event data, or neither is captured. Previous works treat the recovery of these two visual quantities as separate tasks, which does not fit with the above-mentioned nature of event cameras and overlooks the inherent relations between them. We propose an unsupervised learning framework that jointly estimates optical flow (motion) and image intensity (appearance) using a single network. From the data generation model, we newly derive the event-based photometric error as a function of optical flow and image intensity. This error is further combined with the contrast maximization framework to form a comprehensive loss function that provides proper constraints for both flow and intensity estimation. Exhaustive experiments show our method's state-of-the-art performance: in optical flow estimation, it reduces EPE by 20% and AE by 25% compared to unsupervised approaches, while delivering competitive intensity estimation results, particularly in high dynamic range scenarios. Our method also achieves shorter inference time than all other optical flow methods and many of the image reconstruction methods, while they output only one quantity.

      <title>Balancing Robustness and Efficiency in Embedded DNNs Through Activation Function Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based embedded systems for safety-critical applications, such as aerospace and autonomous driving, must be robust to perturbations caused by soft errors. As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems. Experiments are conducted on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Electrocardiography Noise Quantification via Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are frequently degraded by noise, limiting their clinical reliability in both conventional and wearable settings. Existing methods for addressing ECG noise, relying on artifact classification or denoising, are constrained by annotation inconsistencies and poor generalizability. Here, we address these limitations by reframing ECG noise quantification as an anomaly detection task. We propose a diffusion-based framework trained to model the normative distribution of clean ECG signals, identifying deviations as noise without requiring explicit artifact labels. To robustly evaluate performance and mitigate label inconsistencies, we introduce a distribution-based metric using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$). Our model achieved a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308, outperforming the next-best method by over 48\%. External validation confirmed strong generalizability, facilitating the exclusion of noisy segments to improve diagnostic accuracy and support timely clinical intervention. This approach enhances real-time ECG monitoring and broadens ECG applicability in digital health technologies.</description>
