      <title>Guiding Generative Models for Protein Design: Prompting, Steering and Aligning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models learn probability distributions from data and produce novel samples that capture the salient properties of their training sets. Proteins are particularly attractive for such approaches given their abundant data and the versatility of their representations, ranging from sequences to structures and functions. This versatility has motivated the rapid development of generative models for protein design, enabling the generation of functional proteins and enzymes with unprecedented success. However, because these models mirror their training distribution, they tend to sample from its most probable modes, while low-probability regions, often encoding valuable properties, remain underexplored. To address this challenge, recent work has focused on guiding generative models to produce proteins with user-specified properties, even when such properties are rare or absent from the original training distribution. In this review, we survey and categorize recent advances in conditioning generative models for protein design. We distinguish approaches that modify model parameters, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, from those that keep the model fixed, including conditional generation, retrieval-augmented strategies, Bayesian guidance, and tailored sampling methods. Together, these developments are beginning to enable the steering of generative models toward proteins with desired, and often previously inaccessible, properties.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Insights into Protein Architecture: Persistent Homology and Machine Learning Applied to the Flagellar Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine learning approach that leverages persistent homology to classify bacterial flagellar motors into two functional states: rotated and stalled. By embedding protein structural data into a topological framework, we extract multiscale features from filtered simplicial complexes constructed over atomic coordinates. These topological invariants, specifically persistence diagrams and barcodes, capture critical geometric and connectivity patterns that correlate with motor function. The extracted features are vectorized and integrated into a machine learning pipeline that includes dimensionality reduction and supervised classification. Applied to a curated dataset of experimentally characterized flagellar motors from diverse bacterial species, our model demonstrates high classification accuracy and robustness to structural variation. This approach highlights the power of topological data analysis in revealing functionally relevant patterns beyond the reach of traditional geometric descriptors, offering a novel computational tool for protein function prediction.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models at the Drug Discovery Frontier: A Review on Generating Small Molecules versus Therapeutic Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling, poised to transform the traditionally slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We dissect how the unified framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face shared hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality experimental data, the reliance on inaccurate scoring functions for validation, and the crucial need for experimental validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby shifting the paradigm from mere chemical exploration to the on-demand engineering of novel~therapeutics.</description>
