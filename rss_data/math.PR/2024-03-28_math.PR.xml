      <title>Spherical Covariance Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance representations are developed for the uniform distributions on the Euclidean spheres in terms of spherical gradients and Hessians. They are applied to derive a number of Sobolev type inequalities and to recover and refine the concentration of measure phenomenon, including second order concentration inequalities. A detail account is also given in the case of the circle, with a short overview of H\"offding's kernels and covariance identities in the class of periodic functions.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions between singular values and eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting the explicit bijection between the density of singular values and the density of eigenvalues for bi-unitarily invariant complex random matrix ensembles of finite matrix size we aim at finding the induced probability measure on $j$ eigenvalues and $k$ singular values that we coin $j,k$-point correlation measure. We fully derive all $j,k$-point correlation measures in the simplest cases for one- and two-dimensional matrices. For $n&gt;2$, we find a general formula for the $1,1$-point correlation measure. This formula reduces drastically when assuming the singular values are drawn from a polynomial ensemble, yielding an explicit formula in terms of the kernel corresponding to the singular value statistics. These expressions simplify even further when the singular values are drawn from a P\'{o}lya ensemble and extend known results between their eigenvalue and singular value statistics.</description>

      <title>Note on the complete moment convergence for moving average process of a class of random variables under sub-linear expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the complete moment convergence for the partial sums of moving average processes $\{X_n=\sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty}a_iY_{i+n},n\ge 1\}$ is proved under some proper conditions, where $\{Y_i,-\infty&lt;i&lt;\infty\}$ is a doubly sequence of identically distributed, negatively dependent random variables under sub-linear expectations and $\{a_i,-\infty&lt;i&lt;\infty\}$ is an absolutely summable sequence of real numbers. The results established in sub-linear expectation spaces generalize the corresponding ones in probability space.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the additive martingales related to super-Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(W_{t}(\lambda))_{t\ge 0}$, parametrized by $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, be the additive martingale related to a supercritical super-Brownian motion on the real line and let $W_{\infty}(\lambda)$ be its limit. Under a natural condition for the martingale limit to be non-degenerate, we investigate the rate at which the martingale approaches its limit. Indeed, assuming certain moment conditions on the branching mechanism, we show that the tail martingale $W_{\infty}(\lambda)-W_{t}(\lambda)$, properly normalized, converges in distribution to a non-degenerate random variable, and we identify the limit laws. We find that, for parameters with small absolute value, the fluctuations are affected by the behaviour of the branching mechanism $\psi$ around $0$. In fact, we prove that, in the case of small $|\lambda|$, when $\psi$ is secondly differentiable at $0$, the limit laws are scale mixtures of the standard normal laws, and when $\psi$ is `stable-like' near $0$ in some proper sense, the limit laws are scale mixtures of the stable laws. However, the effect of the branching mechanism is limited in the case of large $|\lambda|$. In the latter case, we show that the fluctuations and limit laws are determined by the limiting extremal process of the super-Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Random Multi-Type Spanning Forests for Synchronization on Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random diffusions are a popular tool in Monte-Carlo estimations, with well established algorithms such as Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) going back several decades. In this work, we introduce diffusion estimators for the problems of angular synchronization and smoothing on graphs, in the presence of a rotation associated to each edge. Unlike classical WoS algorithms, these estimators allow for global estimations by propagating along the branches of multi-type spanning forests, and we show that they can outperform standard numerical-linear-algebra solvers in challenging instances, depending on the topology and density of the graph.</description>

      <title>The image of random analytic functions: coverage of the complex plane via branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the range of random analytic functions with finite radius of convergence. We show that any unbounded random Taylor series with rotationally invariant coefficients has dense image in the plane. We moreover show that if in addition the coefficients are complex Gaussian with sufficiently regular variances, then the image is the whole complex plane. We do this by exploiting an approximate connection between the coverage problem and spatial branching processes. This answers a long-standing open question of J.-P. Kahane, with sufficient regularity.</description>

      <title>Carleman estimates for space semi-discrete approximations of one-dimensional stochastic parabolic equation and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study discrete Carleman estimates for space semi-discrete approximations of one-dimensional stochastic parabolic equation. As applications of these discrete Carleman estimates, we apply them to study two inverse problems for the spatial semi-discrete stochastic parabolic equations, including a discrete inverse random source problem and a discrete Cauchy problem. We firstly establish two Carleman estimates for a one-dimensional semi-discrete stochastic parabolic equation, one for homogeneous boundary and the other for non-homogeneous boundary. Then we apply these two estimates separately to derive two stability results. The first one is the Lipschitz stability for the discrete inverse random source problem. The second one is the H\"{o}lder stability for the discrete Cauchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of stochastic kinetic solutions introduced in arXiv:2108.08858 to establish the well-posedness of stochastic kinetic solutions of generalized Dean-Kawasaki equations with correlated noise on bounded, $C^2$-domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The results apply to a wide class of non-negative boundary data, which is based on certain a priori estimates for the solutions, that encompasses all non-negative constant functions including zero and all smooth functions bounded away from zero.</description>

      <title>Ancestral lineages for a branching annihilating random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ancestral lineages of individuals of a stationary discrete-time branching annihilating random walk (BARW) on the $d$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Each individual produces a Poissonian number of offspring with mean $\mu$ which then jump independently to a uniformly chosen site with a fixed distance $R$ of their parent. By interpreting the ancestral lineage of such an individual as a random walk in a dynamical random environment, we obtain a law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for the ancestral lineage.</description>

      <title>Taming the Interactive Particle Langevin Algorithm -- the superlinear case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic optimization have yielded the interactive particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), which leverages the notion of interacting particle systems (IPS) to efficiently sample from approximate posterior densities. This becomes particularly crucial within the framework of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the E-step is computationally challenging or even intractable. Although prior research has focused on scenarios involving convex cases with gradients of log densities that grow at most linearly, our work extends this framework to include polynomial growth. Taming techniques are employed to produce an explicit discretization scheme that yields a new class of stable, under such non-linearities, algorithms which are called tamed interactive particle Langevin algorithms (tIPLA). We obtain non-asymptotic convergence error estimates in Wasserstein-2 distance for the new class under an optimal rate.</description>

      <title>Possible counter-intuitive impact of local vaccine mandates for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we use a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g.\ within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts.
  We consider what happens if schools are given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that are exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigate how such a mandate affects the probability of an outbreak of a disease and the probability that a pupil that is medically exempt from vaccination, gets infected during an outbreak. We show that if the population vaccine coverage is close to the herd-immunity level then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates are implemented. This is caused by unvaccinated pupils moving to schools without mandates.</description>

      <title>Estimating parameters of continuous-time multi-chain hidden Markov models for infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to estimate the parameters of a stochastic exposed-infected epidemiological model for the transmission dynamics of notifiable infectious diseases, based on observations related to isolated cases counts only. We use the setting of hidden multi-chain Markov models and adapt the Baum-Welch algorithm to the special structure of the multi-chain. From the estimated transition matrix, we retrieve the parameters of interest (contamination rates, incubation rate, and isolation rate) from analytical expressions of the moments and Monte Carlo simulations. The performance of this approach is investigated on synthetic data, together with an analysis of the impact of using a model with one less compartment to fit the data in order to help for model selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate regularity properties of some non-local equations defined on Dirichlet spaces equipped with sub-gaussian estimates for the heat kernel associated to the generator. We prove that weak solutions for homogeneous equations involving pure powers of the generator are actually H\"older continuous and satisfy an Harnack inequality. Our methods are based on a version of the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension method which is valid in any Dirichlet space and our results complement the existing literature on solutions of PDEs on classes of Dirichlet spaces such as fractals.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust monopoly pricing: Switching from low to high prices in volatile markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional monopoly pricing assumes sellers have full information about consumer valuations. We consider monopoly pricing under limited information, where a seller only knows the mean, variance and support of the valuation distribution. The objective is to maximize expected revenue by selecting the optimal fixed price. We adopt a distributionally robust framework, where the seller considers all valuation distributions that comply with the limited information. We formulate a maximin problem which seeks to maximize expected revenue for the worst-case valuation distribution. The minimization problem that identifies the worst-case valuation distribution is solved using primal-dual methods, and in turn leads to an explicitly solvable maximization problem. This yields a closed-form optimal pricing policy and a new fundamental principle prescribing when to use low and high robust prices. We show that the optimal policy switches from low to high prices when variance becomes sufficiently large, yielding significant performance gains compared with existing robust prices that generally decay with market uncertainty. This presents guidelines for when the seller should switch from targeting mass markets to niche markets. Similar guidelines are obtained for delay-prone services with rational utility-maximizing customers, underlining the universality and wide applicability of the low-high pricing principle.</description>

      <title>Level-2 IFS Thermodynamic Formalism: Gibbs probabilities in the space of probabilities and the push-forward map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will denote by $\mathcal{M}$ the space of Borel probabilities on the symbolic space $\Omega=\{1,2...,m\}^\mathbb{N}$. $\mathcal{M}$ is equipped Monge-Kantorovich metric. We consider here the push-forward map $\mathfrak{T}:\mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}$ as a dynamical system. The space of Borel probabilities on $\mathcal{M}$ is denoted by $\mathfrak{M}$. Given a continuous function $A: \mathcal{M}\to \mathbb{R}$, an {\it a priori} probability $\Pi_0$ on $\mathcal{M}$, and a certain convolution operation acting on pairs of probabilities on $\mathcal{M}$, we define an associated Level-2 IFS Ruelle operator. We show the existence of an eigenfunction and an eigenprobability $\hat{\Pi}\in\mathfrak{M}$ for such an operator. Under a normalization condition for $A$, we show the existence of some $\mathfrak{T}$-invariant probabilities $\hat{\Pi}\in\mathfrak{M}.$ We are able to define the variational entropy of such $\hat{\Pi}$ and a related maximization pressure problem associated to $A$. In some particular examples, we show how to get eigenprobabilities solutions on $\mathfrak{M}$ for the Level-2 Thermodynamic Formalism problem from eigenprobabilities on $\mathcal{M}$ for the classical (Level-1) Thermodynamic Formalism. These examples highlight the fact that our approach is a natural generalization of the classic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study Poissonian actions of Polish groups as a framework to Poisson suspensions, characterize them spectrally, and provide a complete characterization of their ergodicity. We further construct 'spatial' Poissonian actions, answering partially a question of Glasner, Tsirelson &amp; Weiss about L\'evy groups. We also construct for every diffeomorphism group an ergodic free spatial probability preserving actions.

      <title>Central limit theorems describing isolation by distance under various forms of power-law dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we uncover new asymptotic isolation by distance patterns occurring under long-range dispersal of offspring. We extend a recent work of the first author, in which this information was obtained from forwards-in-time dynamics using a novel stochastic partial differential equations approach for spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot models. The latter were introduced by Barton, Etheridge and V\'eber as a framework to model the evolution of the genetic composition of a spatially structured population. Reproduction takes place through extinction-recolonisation events driven by a Poisson point process. During an event, in certain ball-shaped areas, a parent is sampled and a proportion of the population is replaced. We generalize the previous approach of the first author by allowing the area from which a parent is sampled during events to differ from the area in which offspring are dispersed, and the radii of these regions follow power-law distributions. In particular, while in previous works the motion of ancestral lineages and coalescence behaviour were closely linked, we demonstrate that local and non-local coalescence is possible for ancestral lineages governed by both fractional and standard Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of a one-dimensional polymer in a repulsive i.i.d. environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study a one-dimensional polymer penalized by its range and placed in a random environment $\omega$. The law of the simple symmetric random walk up to time $n$ is modified by the exponential of the sum of $\beta \omega_z - h$ sitting on its range, with~$h$ and $\beta$ positive parameters. It is known that, at first order, the polymer folds itself to a segment of optimal size $c_h n^{1/3}$ with $c_h = \pi^{2/3} h^{-1/3}$. Here we study how disorder influences finer quantities. If the random variables $\omega_z$ are i.i.d.\ with a finite second moment, we prove that the left-most point of the range is located near $-u_* n^{1/3}$, where $u_* \in [0,c_h]$ is a constant that only depends on the disorder. This contrast with the homogeneous model (i.e. when $\beta=0$), where the left-most point has a random location between $-c_h n^{1/3}$ and $0$. With an additional moment assumption, we are able to show that the left-most point of the range is at distance $\mathcal U n^{2/9}$ from $-u_* n^{1/3}$ and the right-most point at distance $\mathcal V n^{2/9}$ from $(c_h-u_*) n^{1/3}$. Here again, $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are constants that depend only on $\omega$.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of reversible MCMC methods: elementary derivations and applications to composite methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review criteria for comparing the efficiency of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with respect to the asymptotic variance of estimates of expectations of functions of state, and show how such criteria can justify ways of combining improvements to MCMC methods. We say that a chain on a finite state space with transition matrix $P$ efficiency-dominates one with transition matrix $Q$ if for every function of state it has lower (or equal) asymptotic variance. We give elementary proofs of some previous results regarding efficiency dominance, leading to a self-contained demonstration that a reversible chain with transition matrix $P$ efficiency-dominates a reversible chain with transition matrix $Q$ if and only if none of the eigenvalues of $Q-P$ are negative. This allows us to conclude that modifying a reversible MCMC method to improve its efficiency will also improve the efficiency of a method that randomly chooses either this or some other reversible method, and to conclude that improving the efficiency of a reversible update for one component of state (as in Gibbs sampling) will improve the overall efficiency of a reversible method that combines this and other updates. It also explains how antithetic MCMC can be more efficient than i.i.d. sampling. We also establish conditions that can guarantee that a method is not efficiency-dominated by any other method.</description>

      <title>Maximum of the Gaussian interface model in random external fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Gaussian interface model in the presence of random external fields, that is the finite volume (random) Gibbs measure on $\mathbb{R}^{\Lambda_N}$, $\Lambda_N=[-N, N]^d\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$ with Hamiltonian $H_N(\phi)= \frac{1}{4d}\sum\limits_{x\sim y}(\phi(x)-\phi(y))^2-\sum\limits_{x\in \Lambda_N}\eta(x)\phi(x)$ and $0$-boundary conditions. $\{\eta(x)\}_{x\in \mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a family of i.i.d. symmetric random variables. We study how the typical maximal height of a random interface is modified by the addition of quenched bulk disorder. We show that the asymptotic behavior of the maximum changes depending on the tail behavior of the random variable $\eta(x)$ when $d\geq 5$. In particular, we identify the leading order asymptotics of the maximum.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Stochastic Evolution Equations in the Critical Variational Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the weak convergence approach, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for solutions to quasilinear stochastic evolution equations with small Gaussian noise in the critical variational setting, a recently developed general variational framework. No additional assumptions are made apart from those required for well-posedness. In particular, no monotonicity is required, nor a compact embedding in the Gelfand triple. Moreover, we allow for flexible growth of the diffusion coefficient, including gradient noise. This leads to numerous applications for which the LDP was not established yet, in particular equations on unbounded domains with gradient noise.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Basic Limit Theorem of Renewal Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{q_n\}_{n=0}^\infty\subset [0,1]$ satisfy $q_0=0$, $\sum_{n=0}^\infty q_n=1$, and $\gcd\{n\geq 1\mid q_n\neq 0\}=1$. We consider the following process: Let $x$ be a real number. We first set $x=0$. Then $x$ is increased by $i$ with probability $q_i~(i=0,1,2,\cdots)$ every time. For $n\geq 0$, let $p_n$ be the probability such that $x=n$ occurs, so we have $p_0=1$ and $p_n=q_1p_{n-1}+q_2p_{n-2}+\cdots+q_np_0~(n\geq 1)$. In this setting, we have $\lim_n p_n=1/\sum_{i=0}^\infty iq_i$, where we define $1/\sum_{i=0}^\infty iq_i=0$ if $\sum_{i=0}^\infty iq_i=+\infty$. This result is known as (discrete case of) Blackwell's renewal theorem. The proof of $\lim_n p_n=1/\sum_{i=0}^\infty iq_i$ is not trivial, while the meaning of $\lim_n p_n=1/\sum_{i=0}^\infty iq_i$ is clear since the expected value of increasing number $i$ is $\sum_{i=0}^\infty iq_i$. Many proofs of this result have been given. In this paper, we will also provide a proof of this result. The idea of our proof is based on Fourier-analytic methods and Tauberian theorems for almost convergent sequences, while we actually need only elementary analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain essentially matching upper and lower bounds for the expected max-sliced 1-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure on a separable Hilbert space and its empirical distribution from $n$ samples. By proving a Banach space version of this result, we also obtain an upper bound, that is sharp up to a log factor, for the expected max-sliced 2-Wasserstein distance between a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on a Euclidean space and its symmetrized empirical distribution in terms of the operator norm of the covariance matrix of $\mu$ and the diameter of the support of $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Random Vector Functional Link Networks for Function Approximation on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.15776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The learning speed of feed-forward neural networks is notoriously slow and has presented a bottleneck in deep learning applications for several decades. For instance, gradient-based learning algorithms, which are used extensively to train neural networks, tend to work slowly when all of the network parameters must be iteratively tuned. To counter this, both researchers and practitioners have tried introducing randomness to reduce the learning requirement. Based on the original construction of Igelnik and Pao, single layer neural-networks with random input-to-hidden layer weights and biases have seen success in practice, but the necessary theoretical justification is lacking. In this paper, we begin to fill this theoretical gap. We provide a (corrected) rigorous proof that the Igelnik and Pao construction is a universal approximator for continuous functions on compact domains, with approximation error decaying asymptotically like $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ for the number $n$ of network nodes. We then extend this result to the non-asymptotic setting, proving that one can achieve any desired approximation error with high probability provided $n$ is sufficiently large. We further adapt this randomized neural network architecture to approximate functions on smooth, compact submanifolds of Euclidean space, providing theoretical guarantees in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic forms. Finally, we illustrate our results on manifolds with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-compactness of transfer operators for topological Markov shifts with holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider transfer operators for topological Markov shift (TMS) with countable states and with holes which are $2$-cylinders. As main results, if the closed system of the shift has finitely irreducible transition matrix and the potential is a weaker Lipschitz continuous and summable, then we obtain a version of Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius Theorem and quasi-compactness of the associated Ruelle transfer operator. The escape rate of the open system is also calculated. In corollary, it turns out that the Ruelle operator of summable potential on topologically transitive TMS has a spectral gap property. As other example, we apply the main results to the transfer operators associated to graph iterated function systems.</description>
