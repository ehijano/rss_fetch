      <title>Thermodynamics of Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical formulation of the thermodynamics, free energy and entropy, of any generic Bogoliubov de Genes model which develops exceptional point (EP) bifurcations in its complex spectrum when coupled to reservoirs. We apply our formalism to a non-Hermitian Josephson junction where, despite recent claims, the supercurrent does not exhibit any divergences at EPs. The entropy, on the contrary, shows a universal jump of $1/2\log 2$ which can be linked to the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at EPs. Our method allows us to obtain precise analytical boundaries for the temperatures at which such Majorana entropy steps appear. We propose a generalized Maxwell relation linking supercurrents and entropy which could pave the way towards the direct experimental observation of such steps in e.g. quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topology protected by latent crystalline symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher- order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Magnetization processes in non single domain magnetite particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-static hysteresis loops of spherical and spheroidal magnetite nanoparticles with semi-axes ratio a/b = 1.5 and 2.0 with different types of combined magnetic anisotropy are calculated using numerical simulation. For particles of each type the critical diameters Dcr are determined so, that above Dcr the magnetization curling becomes the easiest mode of particle magnetization reversal. Hysteresis loops are calculated both for single-domain nanoparticles in the diameter range Dcr &lt; D &lt; Dc, and for vortex particles with diameters D &gt; Dc, where Dc is the single-domain diameter. The results obtained are compared with the usual hysteresis loops of particles with diameters D &lt; Dcr. Hysteresis loops of dilute oriented assemblies are studied for various angles of the external magnetic field relative to the particle symmetry axis. For the corresponding randomly oriented assemblies the hysteresis loops are obtained by averaging over this angle. It is shown that the magnetization reversal of nanoparticles studied occurs through the nucleation of the curling mode, which can be accompanied by the formation of various vortices in finite intervals of the external magnetic field. The remanent magnetization and coercive force of oriented and non-oriented dilute assemblies of magnetite nanoparticles with different aspect ratios are determined as the functions of the transverse particle diameter.</description>

      <title>Spherulite-enhanced Macroscopic Polarization in Molecular Ferroelectric Films from Vacuum Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-transfer type molecular ferroelectrics hold great application potential due to their large spontaneous polarizations, high Curie temperatures, and small switching fields. However, it is puzzling that preparation of quasi-2D films with macroscopic ferroelectric behaviors has only been reported in few molecular ferroelectrics. To resolve this puzzle, we studied the effect of microstructures on macroscopic ferroelectric properties of 5,6-Dichloro-2-methylbenzimidazole (DC-MBI) films grown using low-temperature deposition followed by restrained crystallization (LDRC) method. We revealed a competition between dense spherulites and porous microstructures containing randomly oriented nanograins in as-grown films. Post-growth annealing at moderate temperature promotes the formation of spherulites which leads to macroscopic ferroelectric polarization switching. These results highlight microstructure density as a critical factor for macroscopic ferroelectric properties, potentially resolving the puzzle for absence of macroscopic ferroelectric behavior in molecules ferroelectric films. We expect the approach for enhancing microstructure density offered in this work to greatly advance fabrication of quasi-2D molecular ferroelectrics films and to unlock their potential in device applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in ultraclean graphene Andreev interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Clip-on lens for scanning tunneling luminescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate and verify the in-situ addition of a collecting lens for electroluminescence experiments to an existing scanning tunneling microscope. We fabricate a simple clip-on lens that we reversibly attach at the sample plate via regular sample transfer tools to collimate the light emitted from a plasmonic tunneling junction to the viewport ordinarily used for optical access. The proximity of the lens to the tunneling junction allows us to exploit the full numerical aperture which helps us achieve good collection efficiencies, demonstrating the quick turnaround of converting an existing setup with optical access into a practical scanning luminescence microscope. We verify the function of the clip-on lens by measuring the bias dependent plasmon of Au, Ag, and spatial luminescence maps.</description>

      <title>Gate-defined quantum point contacts in a germanium quantum well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of quantum point contacts defined in a high-quality strained germanium quantum well with layered electric gates. At zero magnetic field, we observe quantized conductance plateaus in units of 2$e^2/h$. Bias-spectroscopy measurements reveal that the energy spacing between successive one-dimensional subbands ranges from 1.5 to 5\,meV as a consequence of the small effective mass of the holes and the narrow gate constrictions. At finite magnetic fields perpendicular to the device plane, the edges of the conductance plateaus get splitted due to the Zeeman effect and Land\'{e} $g$ factors are estimated to be $\sim6.6$ for the holes in the germanium quantum well. We demonstrate that all quantum point contacts in the same device have comparable performances, indicating a reliable and reproducible device fabrication process. Thus, our work lays a foundation for investigating multiple forefronts of physics in germanium-based quantum devices that require quantum point contacts as a building block.</description>

      <title>Distance between two manifolds, topological phase transitions and scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases are generally characterized by topological invariants denoted by integer numbers. However, different topological systems often require different topological invariants to measure, such as geometric phases, topological orders, winding numbers, etc. Moreover, geometric phases and its associated definitions usually fail at critical points. Therefore, it's challenging to predict what would occur during the transformation between two different topological phases. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a general definition based on fidelity and trace distance from quantum information theory: manifold distance. This definition does not rely on the berry connection of the manifolds but rather on the information of the two manifolds - their ground state wave functions. Thus, it can measure different topological systems (including traditional band topology models, non-Hermitian systems, and topological order models, etc.) and exhibit some universal laws during the transformation between two topological phases. Our research demonstrates that when the properties of two manifolds are identical, the distance and associated higher-order derivatives between them can smoothly transition to each other. However, for two different topological manifolds, the higher-order derivatives exhibit various divergent behaviors near the critical points. For subsequent studies, we expect the method to be generalized to real-space or non-lattice models, in order to facilitate the study of a wider range of physical platforms such as open systems and many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic transport properties in prismatic topological insulator nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface of a three dimensional topological insulator (TI) hosts surface states whose properties are determined by a Dirac-like equation. The electronic system on the surface of TI nanowires with polygonal cross-sectional shape adopts the corresponding polygonal shape. In a constant transverse magnetic field, such an electronic system exhibits rich properties as different facets of the polygon experience different values of the magnetic field due to the changing magnetic field projection between facets. We investigate the energy spectrum and transport properties of nanowires where we consider three different polygonal shapes, all showing distinct properties visible in the energy spectrum and transport properties. Here we propose that the wire conductance can be used to differentiate between cross-sectional shapes of the nanowire by rotating the magnetic field around the wire. Distinguishing between the different shapes also works in the presence of impurities as long as conductance steps are discernible, thus revealing the sub-band structure.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Inverse Spin Hall Effect (AISHE) due to Unconventional Spin Currents in Ferromagnetic Films with Tailored Interfacial Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single layer ferromagnetic film magnetized in the plane of an ac current flow, exhibits a characteristic Hall voltage with harmonic and second harmonic components, which is attributed to the presence of spin currents with polarization non-collinear with the magnetization. A set of 30 nm thick permalloy (Py) films used in this study are deposited at an oblique angle with respect to the substrate plane which induces an in-plane easy axis in the magnetization of the initial nucleating layers of the films which is distinct from the overall bulk magnetic properties of the film. This unusual magnetic texture provides a platform for the direct detection of inverse spin Hall effect in Hall bar shaped macroscopic devices at room temperatures which we denote as Anomalous Inverse Spin Hall Effect (AISHE). Control samples fabricated by normal deposition of permalloy with slow rotation of substrate shows significant reduction of the harmonic Hall signal that further substantiates the model. The analysis of the second harmonic Hall signal corroborates the presence of spin-orbit torque arising from the unconventional spin-currents in the single-layer ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Spin wave vortex as topological probe of magnetic texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vortex, a circulating flow around a void, is one of the basic topological phenomena in nature. Here we show that vortices generally emerge in spin wave travelling upon topologically nontrivial magnetic texture, due to the transverse precession of spin wave about the background magnetization. The winding number of each spin wave vortex is equivalent to sign of the local topological density of magnetic texture at the vortex core, and all winding numbers add up as twice the topological number of the magnetic texture. Based on the charts of spin wave vortices, the magnetization profile of the magnetic texture is reversely constructed, and a universal relation for the magnon topological Hall angle is theoretically proposed and numerically confirmed in vast types of magnetic textures. The simple connection between dynamic and static magnetizations, promotes spin wave vortex as a powerful tool to reveal the topology of the underlying magnetic texture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport properties of Josephson junctions composed of superconductor/minimally twisted bilayer graphene/superconductor structures. In the presence of an out-of-plane electric field, the low energy physics is best described by a network of chiral domain-wall states. Depending on system parameters, they lead to the emergence of zig-zag or pseudo-Landau level modes with distinct transport characteristics. Specifically, we find zig-zag modes feature linear dispersion of Andreev bound states, resulting in a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson current. In contrast, pseudo-Landau level modes exhibit flat Andreev bound states and, consequently, a vanishing bulk Josephson current. Interestingly, edge states can give rise to $4\pi$-periodic Josephson response in the pseudo-Landau level regime. We also discuss experimental signatures of such responses.</description>

      <title>Towards Utilizing Scanning Gate Microscopy as a High-Resolution Probe of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed understanding of the material properties that affect the splitting between the two low-lying valley states in Si/SiGe heterostructures will be increasingly important as the number of spin qubits is increased. Scanning gate microscopy has been proposed as a method to measure the spatial variation of the valley splitting as a tip-induced dot is moved around in the plane of the Si quantum well. We develop a simulation using an electrostatic model of the scanning gate microscope tip and the overlapping gate structure combined with an approximate solution to the three-dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation in the device stack. Using this simulation, we show that a tip-induced quantum dot formed near source and drain electrodes can be adiabatically moved to a region far from the gate electrodes. We argue that by spatially translating the tip-induced dot across a defect in the Si/SiGe interface, changes in valley splitting can be detected.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium relaxation and odd-even effect in finite-temperature electron gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on quasiparticle lifetimes, leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In two-dimensional systems, however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed "odd-parity" modes). Here, we present an efficient method to evaluate the full spectrum of relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ this method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with screened Coulomb interactions and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle modes beyond the asymptotic low temperature limit up to the Fermi temperature, thus covering the temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a comprehensive classification and detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum. In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay rates extends to temperatures as large as $T=0.1T_F$; (ii) there is only a small number of long-lived odd-parity modes, with an infinite number of remaining modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling; (iii) the ratio between the odd- and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, not just temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation mechanism of the modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of two-dimensional electron gases and bridge a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators have attracted significant attention in recent years. Understanding the optical properties and spin Hall effect in these materials is crucial for technological advancements. In this study, we present theoretical analyses to explore the optical properties, Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity of perturbed and pristine PbBiI using the linear combination of atomic orbitals and the Kubo formula. Our calculations reveal that the electronic structure can be modified using staggered exchange fields and electric fields, leading to changes in the optical properties. Additionally, spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity are investigated in terms of various parameters. The results indicate that due to the small dynamical spin Hall conductivity, generating an ac spin current in PbBiI requires the use of external magnetic fields or magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Graphene magnetoresistance control by photoferroelectric substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralow dimensionality of 2D layers magnifies their sensitivity to adjacent charges enabling even postprocessing electric control of multifunctional structures. However, functionalizing 2D layers remains an important challenge for on-demand device property exploitation. Here we report that an electrical and even fully optical way to control and write modifications to the magnetoresistive response of CVD-deposited graphene is achievable through the electrostatics of the photoferroelectric substrate. For electrical control, the ferroelectric polarization switch modifies graphene magnetoresistance by 67% due to a Fermi level shift with related modification in charge mobility. A similar function is also attained entirely by the bandgap light due to the substrate photovoltaic effect. Moreover, an all-optical way to imprint and recover graphene magnetoresistance by light is reported as well as magnetic control of graphene transconductance. These findings extend photoferroelectric control in 2D structures to new a magnetic dimension and advance wireless operation for sensors and field-effect transistors.</description>

Abstract: Equations are obtained for the quantum distribution functions over discrete states in systems of non-interacting fermions and bosons with an arbitrary, including small, number of particles. The case of systems with two levels is considered in detail. The temperature dependences of entropy, heat capacities and pressure in two-level Fermi and Bose systems are calculated for various multiplicities of degeneracy of levels.</description>

      <title>Site-Controlled Purcell-Induced Bright Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photon emitters (SPEs) hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are essential elementary building blocks for enabling future on-chip quantum photonic technologies that operate at room temperature. However, fundamental challenges, such as managing non-radiative decay, competing incoherent processes, as well as engineering difficulties in achieving deterministic placement and scaling of the emitters, limit their full potential. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate large-area arrays of plasmonic nanoresonators for Purcell-induced site-controlled SPEs by engineering emitter-cavity coupling and enhancing radiative emission at room temperature. The plasmonic nanoresonator architecture consists of gold-coated silicon pillars capped with an alumina spacer layer, enabling a 10-fold local field enhancement in the emission band of native hBN defects. Confocal photoluminescence and second-order autocorrelation measurements show bright SPEs with sub-30 meV bandwidth and a saturated emission rate of more than 3.8 million counts per second. We measure a Purcell factor of 4.9, enabling average SPE lifetimes of 480 ps, a five-fold reduction as compared to emission from gold-free devices, along with an overall SPE yield of 21%. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the beneficial role of an alumina spacer between defected hBN and gold, as an insulating layer can mitigate the electronic broadening of emission from defects proximal to gold. Our results offer arrays of bright, heterogeneously integrated quantum light sources, paving the way for robust and scalable quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Defect-Assisted Domain Nucleation Drives Unique Exchange Bias Phenomena in $\bf{MnBi_2Te_4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the mechanism of exchange bias phenomena and the achievement of its efficient control are of great importance, as it promotes the revelation of unique exchange interactions and the development of exotic applications. However, it is challenging due to the elusive interface between magnetic phases. In this study, we report an unprecedented exchange bias phenomenon observed in ultrathin uncompensated antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. The magnitude and direction of the exchange field can be intentionally controlled by designing a magnetic field sweep protocol without a field cooling process. The combined experimental and theoretical simulation results indicate that the spin-flip process assisted by the ubiquitous defect-induced pinning domain sites with varying inner exchange interactions might give rise to the emergence and robustness of this peculiar exchange bias. The temperature and thickness dependence of the exchange bias phenomena are systematically investigated for further study and exploitation of its unique properties. This mechanism hold promise for highly tunable exchange bias in prevalent magnetic systems by engineering the properties of domain structures, and also offers promising avenues for the design of spintronic devices combing its topology based on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.</description>

      <title>Resonant-force induced symmetry breaking in a quantum parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parametrically modulated oscillator has two opposite-phase vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. An extra force at the vibration frequency breaks the symmetry of the states. The effect can be extremely strong due to the interplay between the force and the quantum fluctuations resulting from the coupling of the oscillator to a thermal bath. The force changes the rates of the fluctuation-induced walk over the quantum states of the oscillator. If the number of the states is large, the effect accumulates to an exponentially large factor in the rate of switching between the vibrational states. We find the factor and analyze it in the limiting cases. We show that in the zero-temperature limit the extra force breaks the detailed balance, leading to a nonperturbatively strong increase of the switching rate.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile optical control of interlayer stacking order in 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonvolatile optical manipulation of material properties on demand is a highly sought-after feature in the advancement of future optoelectronic applications. While the discovery of such metastable transition in various materials holds good promise for achieving this goal, their practical implementation is still in the nascent stage. Here, we unravel the nature of the ultrafast laser-induced hidden state in 1T-TaS2 by systematically characterizing the electronic structure evolution throughout the reversible transition cycle. We identify it as a mixed-stacking state involving two similarly low-energy interlayer orders, which is manifested as the charge density wave phase disruption. Furthermore, our comparative experiments utilizing the single-pulse writing, pulse-train erasing and pulse-pair control explicitly reveal the distinct mechanism of the bidirectional transformations -- the ultrafast formation of the hidden state is initiated by a coherent phonon which triggers a competition of interlayer stacking orders, while its recovery to the initial state is governed by the progressive domain coarsening. Our work highlights the deterministic role of the competing interlayer orders in the nonvolatile phase transition in the layered material 1T-TaS2, and promises the coherent control of the phase transition and switching speed. More importantly, these results establish all-optical engineering of stacking orders in low-dimensional materials as a viable strategy for achieving desirable nonvolatile electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals assembly allows for the creation of Josephson junctions in an atomically sharp interface between two exfoliated Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) flakes that are twisted relative to each other. In a narrow range of angles close to $45^\circ$, the junction exhibits a regime where time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken and it can be used to encode an inherently protected qubit called flowermon. In this work we investigate the physics emerging when two such junctions are integrated in a SQuID circuit threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the flowermon qubit regime is maintained up to a finite critical value of the magnetic field and, under appropriate conditions, it is protected against both charge and flux noise. For larger external fluxes, the interplay between the inherent twisted d-wave nature of the order parameter and the external magnetic flux enables the implementation of different artificial atoms, including a flux-biased protected qubit and a supersymmetric quantum circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform network analysis of a system described by the master equation to estimate the lower bound of the steady-state current noise, starting from the level 2.5 large deviation function and using the graph theory approach. When the transition rates are uniform, and the system is driven to a non-equilibrium steady state by unidirectional transitions, we derive a noise lower bound, which accounts for fluctuations of sojourn times at all states and is expressed using mesh currents. This bound is applied to the uncertainty in the signal-to-noise ratio of the fluctuating computation time of a schematic Brownian computation plus reset process described by a graph containing one cycle. Unlike the mixed and pseudo-entropy bounds that increase logarithmically with the length of the intended computation path, this bound depends on the number of extraneous predecessors and thus captures the logical irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Mixed Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: strong symmetry, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and weak symmetry, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function $\mathrm{Tr}(O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho)$, the strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) is measured by the fidelity $F(\rho, O_xO^{\dagger}_y\rho O_yO^{\dagger}_x)$, dubbed the fidelity correlator. We prove that SW-SSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SW-SSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study non-thermal scenarios where decoherence induces SW-SSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SW-SSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SW-SSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SW-SSB, through correlation functions with higher R\'enyi indices.</description>

      <title>Surface-dominated conductance scaling in Weyl semimetal NbAs</title>

Abstract: Protected surface states arising from non-trivial bandstructure topology in semimetals can potentially enable new device functionalities in compute, memory, interconnect, sensing, and communication. This necessitates a fundamental understanding of surface-state transport in nanoscale topological semimetals. Here, we investigate quantum transport in a prototypical topological semimetal NbAs to evaluate the potential of this class of materials for beyond-Cu interconnects in highly-scaled integrated circuits. Using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, we show that the resistance-area RA product in NbAs films decreases with decreasing thickness at the nanometer scale, in contrast to a nearly constant RA product in ideal Cu films. This anomalous scaling originates from the disproportionately large number of surface conduction states which dominate the ballistic conductance by up to 70% in NbAs thin films. We also show that this favorable RA scaling persists even in the presence of surface defects, in contrast to RA sharply increasing with reducing thickness for films of conventional metals, such as Cu, in the presence of surface defects. These results underscore the promise of topological semimetals like NbAs as future back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnect metals.</description>

Abstract: The computational research that will be presented compares the coherent states of multiple layer graphene versus the coherent states of lithium ions diffused within this multilayer graphene. Unlike the prevailing research on graphene coherent states that uses an external magnetic vector potential, this research will utilize an electric vector potential that is inherent from the electron current density that transverses the {\pi}-bonds on the graphene surface. The results from this study will display that the electric vector potential produces energies that can lead to coherent states for graphene and lithiated graphene without the necessity of a strong applied magnetic vector potential. Two excited states will be analyzed for each material. The first excited state (n=1) the graphene coherent state energies lags behind the energies of the lithiated graphene coherent state where as the second excited state (n=2) the coherent state energies of graphene exceeds that of the lithiated graphene coherent state.</description>

Abstract: In this Reply we respond to the comment by Antipov et al. from Microsoft Quantum on Hess et al., PRL 130, 207001 (2023). Antipov et al. reported only a single simulation and claimed it did not pass the Microsoft Quantum topological gap protocol (TGP). They have provided no parameters or data for this simulation (despite request). Regardless, in this reply we demonstrate that the trivial bulk gap reopening mechanism outlined in Hess et al., in combination with trivial ZBPs, passes the TGP and therefore can result in TGP false positives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we show that a magnon spin capacitor can be realized at a junction between two exchange coupled ferromagnets. In this junction, the buildup of magnon spin over the junction is coupled to the difference in magnon chemical potential, realizing the magnon spin analogue of an electrical capacitor. The relation between magnon spin and magnon chemical potential difference directly follows from considering the magnon density-density interaction between the two ferromagnets. We analyse the junction in detail by considering spin injection and detection from normal metal leads, the tunneling current across the junction and magnon decay within the ferromagnet, showing that such a structure realizes a magnon spin capacitor in series with a spin resistor. Choosing yttrium iron garnet as the ferromagnet, we numerically calculate the capacitance, which ranges from picofarad to microfarad, depending on the area of the junction. We therefore conclude that the magnon spin capacitor could directly be of use in applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Casimir torque -- a rotational motion caused by the minimization of the zero-point energy -- is a problem that attracts significant theoretical and experimental interest. Recently, it has been realized using liquid crystal phases and natural anisotropic substrates. However, for natural materials, the torque reaches substantial values only at van der Waals distances of ~10 nm. Here, we employ Casimir self-assembly using templated gold nanostructures of triangular symmetry for the purpose of rotational self-alignment at truly Casimir distances (100 -- 200 nm separation). The joint action of repulsive electrostatic and attractive Casimir potentials leads to the formation of a stable quantum trap, giving rise to a tunable Fabry-Perot microcavity. This cavity self aligns both laterally and rotationally to maximize the overlap area between the templated and floating triangular flakes. The rotational self-alignment is remarkably sensitive to the equilibrium distance between the two triangles as well as their area, which opens possibilities for active control through manipulating the electrostatic screening. Our self-assembled and self-aligned Casimir microcavities could find future use as a versatile and tunable platform for nanophotonic, polaritonic, and optomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Graphene conductivity: Kubo model versus QFT-based model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare three available models of graphene conductivity: a non-local Kubo model, a local model derived by Falkovsky, and finally a non-local Quantum Field Theory based (QFT-b) model. The first two models are extensively used in the nanophotonic community. All these models are not ab-initio since they contain phenomenological parameters (like Fermi velocity, chemical potential and/or mass gap parameters that depend on the chosen material and possibly on external perturbations), and are supposed to provide coherent results since they are derived from the same starting Hamiltonian. While we confirm that the local model is a proper limit of the non-local Kubo model, we find some inconsistencies in the QFT-b model as derived and used in the literature. In particular, differently from the Kubo model, the QFT-b model shows a plasma-like behavior for the interband transversal conductivity at low frequencies instead of the expected behavior (an almost constant conductivity as a function of frequency $\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\hbar\omega &lt; \sqrt{(\hbar v_{F}q)^{2} + 4m^{2}}$). We show how to correctly regularize the QFT-b model in order to satisfy the gauge invariance and, once also losses are correctly included, we show that the Kubo and QFT-b model exactly coincide. Our finding can be of relevant interest for both theory, predictions and experimental tests in both the nanophotonic and Casimir effect communities.</description>

Abstract: Ultraviolet nanosecond laser annealing (UV-NLA) proves to be an important technique, particularly when tightly controlled heating and melting are necessary. In the realm of semiconductor technologies, the significance of nanosecond laser annealing (NLA) grows in tandem with the escalating intricacy of integration schemes in nano-scaled devices. Silicon-germanium alloys have been studied for decades for their compatibility with silicon devices. Indeed, they enable the manipulation of properties like strain, carrier mobilities and bandgap. In this framework, they can for instance boost the performances of p-type MOSFETs but also enable near infra-red absorption and emission for applications in photo-detection and photonics. Laser melting on such type of layers, however results, up to now, in the development of extended defects and poor control over layer morphology and homogeneity. In our study, we investigate the laser melting of ~700 nm thick relaxed silicon-germanium samples coated with SiO2 nano-arrays, observing the resulting material to maintain an unaltered lattice. We found the geometrical parameters of the silicon oxide having an impact on the thermal budget samples see, influencing melt threshold, melt depth and germanium distribution.</description>

      <title>A $C^\ast$-algebraic view on the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals</title>

Abstract: Understanding the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals is an open problem. We approach it from the viewpoint of $C^\ast$-algebras and calculate all admissible Chern numbers of a strongly coupled tight-binding skyrmion system on a triangular lattice as a function of Fermi energy and texture parameters. Our analysis reveals the topological complexity of electronic states coupled to spin textures, and the failure of the adiabatic picture to account for it in terms of emergent electromagnetism. On the contrary, we explain the discontinuous jumps in the real-space winding number in terms of collective evolution in real-, reciprocal, and mixed space Chern numbers. Our work sets the stage for further research on topological dynamics in complex dynamic spin textures coupled to external fields.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium finite frequency resonances in differential quantum noise driven by Majorana interference</title>

Abstract: Nonequilibrium quantum noise $S^&gt;(\omega,V)$ measured at finite frequencies $\omega$ and bias voltages $V$ probes Majorana bound states in a host nanostructure via fluctuation fingerprints unavailable in average currents or static shot noise. When Majorana interference is brought into play, it enriches nonequilibrium states and makes their nature even more unique. Here we demonstrate that an interference of two Majorana modes via a nonequilibrium quantum dot gives rise to a remarkable finite frequency response of the differential quantum noise $\partial S^&gt;(\omega,V,\Delta\phi)/\partial V$ driven by the Majorana phase difference $\Delta\phi$. Specifically, at low bias voltages there develops a narrow resonance of width $\hbar\Delta\omega\sim\sin^2\Delta\phi$ at a finite frequency determined by $V$, whereas for high bias voltages there arise two antiresonances at two finite frequencies controlled by both $V$ and $\Delta\phi$. We show that the maximum and minimum of these resonance and antiresonances have universal fractional values, $3e^3/4h$ and $-e^3/4h$. Moreover, detecting the frequencies of the antiresonances provides a potential tool to measure $\Delta\phi$ in nonequilibrium experiments on Majorana finite frequency quantum noise.</description>

Abstract: Domain wall bimerons (DWBMs) are nanoscale spin textures residing within the magnetic domain walls of in-plane magnets. In this study, we employ both numerical and analytical methods to explore the stabilization of N\'eel-type domain wall bimerons and their dynamics when excited by spin-orbit torque. Our findings reveal two unique and intriguing dynamic mechanisms, which depend on the polarization direction of the spin current: In the first scenario, the magnetic domain wall serves as a track that confines the motion of the bimeron and effectively suppresses the skyrmion Hall effect. In the second scenario, pushing the magnetic domain wall triggers a rapid sliding of the bimeron along the wall. This process significantly enhances the dynamics of the bimeron, resulting in a velocity increase of approximately 40 times compared to skyrmions and bimeron solitons. Our results highlight the potential advantages of the skyrmion Hall effect in developing energy-efficient spintronic devices based on domain wall bimerons.</description>

      <title>Reversal of quantised Hall drifts at non-interacting and interacting topological boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport properties of gapless edge modes at boundaries between topologically distinct domains are of fundamental and technological importance. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of topological edge states and their response to interparticle interactions. Here, we experimentally study long-distance quantised Hall drifts in a harmonically confined topological pump of non-interacting and interacting ultracold fermionic atoms. We find that quantised drifts halt and reverse their direction when the atoms reach a critical slope of the confining potential, revealing the presence of a topological boundary. The drift reversal corresponds to a band transfer between a band with Chern number $C = +1$ and a band with $C = -1$ via a gapless edge mode, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence for non-interacting particles. We establish that a non-zero repulsive Hubbard interaction leads to the emergence of an additional edge in the system, relying on a purely interaction-induced mechanism, in which pairs of fermions are split.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Quantum Effects in Atomistic Spin Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) is a standard tool to model the magnetization dynamics of a variety of materials. The fundamental dynamical model underlying ASD is entirely classical. In this paper, we present two approaches to effectively incorporate quantum effects into ASD simulations, thus enhancing their low temperature predictions. The first allows to simulate the magnetic behavior of a quantum spin system by solving the equations of motion of a classical spin system at an effective temperature relative to the critical temperature. This effective temperature is determined a priori from the microscopic properties of the system. The second approach is based on a \semi model where classical spins interact with an environment with a quantum-like power spectrum. The parameters that characterize this model can be calculated ab initio or extracted from experiments. This semi-classical model quantitatively reproduces the absolute temperature behavior of a magnetic system, thus accounting for the quantum mechanical aspects of its dynamics, even at low temperature. The methods presented here can be readily implemented in current ASD simulations with no additional complexity cost.</description>

      <title>Liquid-solid friction on crystalline surfaces: a perspective</title>

Abstract: Liquids flowing against solid surfaces experience friction. While solid friction is familiar to anyone with a sense of touch, liquid friction is much more exotic. At macroscopic scales indeed, the assumption of inifinite friction, i.e. that interfacial liquid molecules stick to solid surfaces, is hard to disprove. Still, it has been known for a few decades that some materials exhibit very strong liquid slippage, leading to a dramatic increase in the permeability of nanoscale tubes to liquid flow. Harnessing liquid friction holds the promise of high-efficiency membrane separation processes, heat recovery systems or blue energy harvesting, making it a highly strategic field for reducing carbon emissions and addressing the climate emergency. In this chapter we review the history of liquid-solid friction measurements, mainly driven by the advent of new techniques and materials. We highlight the most established results and point out some directions that seem to us to be particularly dynamic and promising for the field.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Calculations of Nonlinear Susceptibility and Multi-Phonon Mixing Processes in a 2DEG-Piezoelectric Heterostructure</title>

Abstract: Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous splitting of d-wave surface states: Circulating currents or edge magnetization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-breaking edges of $d$-wave superconductors feature Andreev bound states at the Fermi energy. Since these states are energetically highly unfavorable they are susceptible to effects that shift them to finite energy. We investigate the free energy of two different mechanisms: spontaneous phase gradients in the superconducting order parameter and surface ferromagnetism caused by Fermi liquid interaction effects. We find that the surface magnetization appears at lower temperatures than the spontaneous current flow of the phase-crystal state. The magnetic state can, however, be energetically favorable at lower temperatures for sufficiently strong Fermi liquid effects. As a result, first-order transitions between the two states are possible, suggesting a rich low-temperature phase diagram in $d$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Charge density-waves with non-trivial orbital textures in rare earth tritellurides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments reporting unconventional collective modes in the charge density-wave (CDW) state of rare-earth tritellurides $R$Te$_3$, we derive from a multi-orbital microscopic model on the square net a CDW Ginzburg-Landau theory that allows for non-trivial orbital order. Our analysis reveals unconventional CDWs where order parameters with distinct orbital character coexist due to an approximate symmetry of the low-energy model, which becomes exact in the limit of nearest-neighbor-only hopping and decoupled $p_x$, $p_y$ orbitals. Because of this coexistence, the resulting CDW pattern displays an orbital texture that generally breaks additional symmetries of the lattice besides those explicitly broken by the CDW wave-vector. In particular, we find two competing phases that differ in whether they break or preserve inversion and vertical mirror symmetries. We explain the mechanisms that favor each outcome, and discuss experimental probes that can distinguish the different phases.</description>
