      <title>Computational Analysis of the Temperature Profile Developed for a Hot Zone of 2500{\deg}C in an Induction Furnace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature gradients developed at ultra-high temperatures create a challenge for temperature measurements that are required for material processing. At ultra-high temperatures, the components of the system can react and change phases depending on their thermodynamic stability. These reactions change the system's physical properties, such as thermal conductivity and fluidity. This phenomenon complicates the extrapolation of temperature measurements, as they depend on the thermal conductivity of multiple insulating layers. The proposed model is an induction furnace employing an electromagnetic field to generate heat reaching 2500 degrees Celsius. A heat transfer simulation applying the finite element method determined temperatures and verified experimentally at key locations on the surface of the experimental setup within the furnace. The computed temperature profile of cylindrical graphite crucibles embedded in a larger cylindrical graphite body surrounded by zirconia grog is determined. Compared to experimental results, the simulation showed a percentage error of approximately 3.4 percent, confirming its accuracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient hybrid-functional-based force and stress calculations for periodic systems with thousands of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient linear-scaling algorithm for evaluating the analytical force and stress contributions derived from the exact-exchange energy, a key component in hybrid functional calculations. The algorithm, working equally well for molecular and periodic systems, is formulated within the framework of numerical atomic orbital (NAO) basis sets and takes advantage of the localized resolution-of-identity (LRI) technique for treating the two-electron Coulomb repulsion integrals. The linear-scaling behavior is realized by fully exploiting the sparsity of the expansion coefficients resulting from the strict locality of the NAOs and the LRI ansatz. Our implementation is massively parallel, and enables efficient structural relaxation based on hybrid density functionals for bulk materials containing thousands of atoms. In this work, we will present a detailed description of our algorithm and benchmark the performance of our implementation using illustrating examples. By optimizing the structures of the pristine and doped halide perovskite material CsSnI$_3$ with different functionals, we find that in the presence of lattice strain, hybrid functionals provide a more accurate description of the stereochemical expression of the lone pair.</description>

      <title>van der Waals Torque in 2D Materials Induced by Interaction between Many-Body Charge Density Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals torque determines the relative rotational motion between anisotropic objects, being of relevance to low-dimensional systems. Here we demonstrate a substantial torque between anisotropic two-dimensional materials that arises from the interaction between many-body charge density fluctuations, exceeding by twenty-fold the torque computed with atom-pairwise models. The dependence of torque on the disorientation angle, the positive correlation between torque and in-planar dielectric anisotropy, the linear relation between torque and area, and the decaying torque with increasing separation are rediscovered using the fully atomistic many-body dispersion model. Unlike continuum Casimir-Lifshitz theory, the advantage of the molecular theory relies on describing the collective torque and the effects of atomic details on an equal footing. These findings open an avenue for incorporating quantum fluctuation-induced torque into molecular modeling, being instrumental to the design of nanoelectromechanical systems and the understanding of rotational dynamics of anisotropic layered materials.</description>

      <title>Constraining the inner boundaries of COCONUT through plasma \b{eta} and Alfv\'en speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather modelling has been gaining importance due to our increasing dependency on technology sensitive to space weather effects, such as satellite services, air traffic and power grids. Improving the reliability, accuracy and numerical performance of space weather modelling tools, including global coronal models, is essential to develop timely and accurate forecasts and to help partly mitigate the space weather threat. Global corona models, however, require accurate boundary conditions, for the formulations of which we have very limited observational data. Unsuitable boundary condition prescriptions may lead to inconsistent features in the solution flow field and spoil the code's accuracy and performance. In this paper, we develop an adjustment to the inner boundary condition of the COCONUT global corona model to better capture the dynamics over and around the regions of stronger magnetic fields by constraining the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed. Using data from solar observations and solar atmospheric modelling codes such as Bifrost, we find that the baseline homogeneous boundary condition formulations for pressure and density do not capture the plasma conditions physically accurately. We develop a method to adjust these prescribed pressure and density values by placing constraints on the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed that act as proxies. We demonstrate that we can remove inexplicable fast streams from the solution by constraining the maximum Alfv\'en speed and the minimum plasma \b{eta} on the boundary surface. We also show that the magnetic topology is not significantly affected by this treatment otherwise. The presented technique shows the potential to ease the modelling of solar maxima, especially removing inexplicable features while, at the same time, not significantly affecting the magnetic field topology around the affected regions.</description>

      <title>CK-MPM: A Compact-Kernel Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based simulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling phenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc. Despite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing instabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels. Existing solutions mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape functions, but at the cost of increased computational overhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel $C^2$-continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance between stability and computational efficiency. Our method integrates seamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) MPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle compared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework, which associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they occupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force computations. To further accelerate performance, we present a GPU-optimized implementation inspired by state-of-the-art massively parallel MPM techniques, achieving an additional $2\times$ speedup in G2P2G transfers over quadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests, comparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and scaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the transformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's capabilities for stable, high-performance simulations, paving the way for more computationally efficient applications in computer graphics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Centrality and Universality in Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel paradigm for modeling real-world scale-free networks, where the integration of new nodes is driven by the combined attractiveness of degree and betweenness centralities, the competition of which (expressed by a parameter $0\le p\le 1$) shapes the structure of the evolving network. We reveal the ability to seamlessly explore a vast landscape of scale-free networks, unlocking an entirely new class of complex networks that we call \textit{stars-with-filament} structure. Remarkably, the average degree $\bar k$ of these networks grows like $\log t$ to some power, where $t$ is time and the average shortest path length grows logarithmically with the system size for intermediate $p$ values, offering fresh insights into the structural dynamics of scale-free systems. Our approach is backed by a robust mean-field theory, which nicely captures the dynamics of $\bar{k}$. We further unveil a rich, $p$-dependent phase diagram, encompassing 47 real-world scale-free networks, shedding light on previously hidden patterns. This work opens exciting new avenues for understanding the universal properties of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Discretization anisotropy in micromagnetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite difference based micromagnetic simulations are a powerful tool for the computational investigation of magnetic structures. In this paper, we demonstrate how the discretization of continuous micromagnetic equations introduces a numerical 'discretization anisotropy'. We demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, this anisotropy operates on an energy scale comparable to that of intrinsic physical phenomena. Furthermore, we illustrate that selecting appropriate finite difference stencils and minimizing the size of the discretization cells are effective strategies to mitigate discretization anisotropy.</description>

      <title>CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 13 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</description>

      <title>Double Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Approach with Full Inclusion of 4-Hole-2-Particle Excitations and Three-Body Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double ionization potential (DIP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) method with a full treatment of 4-hole-2-particle (4$h$-2$p$) correlations and triply excited clusters, abbreviated as DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$), and its approximate form called DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) have been formulated and implemented in the open-source CCpy package available on GitHub. The resulting codes work with both nonrelativistic and spin-free scalar-relativistic Hamiltonians. By examining the DIPs of Cl$_{2}$, Br$_{2}$, and HBr, for which accurate experimental data are available, we demonstrate that the DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$) and DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) approaches improve the results obtained using the DIP-EOMCC methods truncated at 3$h$-1$p$ or 4$h$-2$p$ excitations on top of the CC calculations with singles and doubles.</description>

      <title>Localized fermions on the triangular lattice with Ising-like interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of localized fermions on the triangular lattice is analyzed in means of the Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The Hamiltonian of the system has a form of the extended Hubbard model (at the atomic limit) with nearest-neighbor Ising-like magnetic $J$ interactions and onsite Coulomb $U$ interactions. The model is investigated for both signs of $J$, arbitrary $U$ interaction and arbitrary chemical potential $\mu$ (or, equivalently, arbitrary particle concentration $n$). Based on the specific heat capacity and sublattice magnetization analyses, the phase diagrams of the model are determined. For ferromagnetic case ($J&lt;0$), the transition from the ordered phase (which is a standard ferromagnet and can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.61$) is found to be second-order (for sufficiently large temperatures $k_{B}T/|J| \gtrsim 0.2$) or first-order (for $-1&lt;U/|J|&lt;-0.65$ at the half-filling, i.e., $n=1$). In the case of $J&gt;0$, the ordered phase occurs in a range of $-1/2&lt;U/|J|&lt;0$ (for $n=1$), while for larger $U$ the state with short-range order is also found (also for $n \neq 1$). The ordered phase is characterized by an antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in two sublattices forming the hexagonal lattice. The transition from this ordered phase, which is found also for $\mu \neq 0$ ($n \neq 1$) and $U/|J|&gt;-1/2$ is always second-order for any model parameters. The ordered phase for $J&gt;0$ can be stable up to $k_{B}T/|J| \approx 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Non-locality detection in nano-semiconductors based on lagging models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we construct a Wannier tight-binding model for TaS$_2$ under a superlattice potential modulation, based on the Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations database established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, so as to study the electronic properties of the structure. Our computational method enables direct calculation of the energy bands from the Hamiltonian without any additional assumptions. We observed a pair of dispersionless flat bands, significant interactions between energy bands, and nontrivial modification of band dispersion at low modulated electric potentials. This work provides a valuable reference for researchers investigating two-dimensional condensed matter materials under superlattice potential modulation.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative and entropy stable solid wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for imposing non-linear entropy conservative and entropy stable wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of an adiabatic wall or a wall with a prescribed heat entropy flow, addressing three scenarios: electrically insulating walls, thin walls with finite conductivity, and perfectly conducting walls. The procedure relies on the formalism and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts, and simultaneous-approximation-term operators. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of boundary conditions is coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable discrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are weakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a simultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation operators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators) on high-order unstructured grids are used to demonstrate the new procedure's accuracy, robustness, and efficacy for weakly enforcing boundary conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the non-linear stability of the proposed technique, with applications to three-dimensional flows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm summation-by-parts spatial operator, including finite element, finite difference, finite volume, nodal and modal discontinuous Galerkin, and flux reconstruction schemes.</description>

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials with high surface area, adjustable porosity, and structural tunability, making them ideal for diverse applications. However, traditional experimental and computational methods have limited scalability and interpretability, hindering effective exploration of MOF structure-property relationships. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a category-specific topological learning (CSTL), which combines algebraic topology with chemical insights for robust property prediction. The model represents MOF structures as simplicial complexes and incorporates elemental categorizations to enable balanced, interpretable machine learning study. By integrating category-specific persistent homology, CSTL captures both global and local structural characteristics, rendering multi-dimensional, category-specific descriptors that support a predictive model with high accuracy and robustness across eight MOF datasets, outperforming all previous results. This alignment of topological and chemical features enhances the predictive power and interpretability of CSTL, advancing understanding of structure-property relationships of MOFs and promoting efficient material discovery.</description>

      <title>Superionic Ionic Conductor Discovery via Multiscale Topological Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium superionic conductors (LSICs) are crucial for next-generation solid-state batteries, offering exceptional ionic conductivity and enhanced safety for renewable energy and electric vehicles. However, their discovery is extremely challenging due to the vast chemical space, limited labeled data, and the understanding of complex structure-function relationships required for optimizing ion transport. This study introduces a multiscale topological learning (MTL) framework, integrating algebraic topology and unsupervised learning to tackle these challenges efficiently. By modeling lithium-only and lithium-free substructures, the framework extracts multiscale topological features and introduces two topological screening metrics-cycle density and minimum connectivity distance-to ensure structural connectivity and ion diffusion compatibility. Promising candidates are clustered via unsupervised algorithms to identify those resembling known superionic conductors. For final refinement, candidates that pass chemical screening undergo ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for validation. This approach led to the discovery of 14 novel LSICs, four of which have been independently validated in recent experiments. This success accelerates the identification of LSICs and demonstrates broad adaptability, offering a scalable tool for addressing complex materials discovery challenges.</description>

      <title>CrystalFlow: A Flow-Based Generative Model for Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a physically motivated loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure effectively captures the relevant dynamical frequencies in the time evolution and is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics. We showcase the method's effectiveness by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D. By extracting the asymptotic long-time evolution, we uncover signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, the method presented here shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches and highlight the potential to explore previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Note on Hyperbolic Relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system for incompressible two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-phase dynamics of two incompressible and immiscible fluids. As a mathematical model we rely on the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system that belongs to the class of diffuse-interface models. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system exhibit strong non-local effects due to the velocity divergence constraint and the fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard operator. We suggest a new first-order approximative system for the inviscid sub-system. It relies on the artificial-compressibility ansatz for the Navier-Stokes equations, a friction-type approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and a relaxation of a third-order capillarity term. We show under reasonable assumptions that the first-order operator within the approximative system is hyperbolic; precisely we prove for the spatially one-dimensional case that it is equipped with an entropy-entropy flux pair with convex (mathematical) entropy. For specific states we present a numerical characteristic analysis. Thanks to the hyperbolicity of the system, we can employ all standard numerical methods from the field of hyperbolic conservation laws. We conclude the paper with preliminary numerical results in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Molecular tuning of excitons and polarization anisotropy in hybrid bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, built from monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals with different lattice orientations, generate interlayer potentials leading to unique excitonic properties. However, the ability to tune the interlayer potential is limited by the fixed covalent 2D lattice geometries. Synthetically substituting one of the layers with an atomically thin molecular crystal could substantially expand the design space for tuning the excitonic response, enabled by explicit control of chemical and electronic structures of the molecular building blocks. Here we report the large-scale synthesis of four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), comprising perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer single crystals, which show precise tuning of the HBC lattices at the molecular level. We observe near-unity anisotropic photoluminescence, which is directly tuned by specific molecular geometry and HBC composition. Our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations show that the anisotropic emission originates from delocalized and anisotropic hybrid excitons. These excitons inherit characteristics from states associated with both the TMD and molecular layers, resulting from a hybridized bilayer band structure of the HBC. By introducing HBCs as a scalable solid-state platform, our work paves the way for tunable interlayer energy landscapes achievable through direct synthesis, opening up new frontiers in molecule-based quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the silicon vacancy in 3C SiC as a color center of interest in the field of Quantum Technologies, focusing on its magnetic interaction with the SiC nuclear spin bath containing Si29 and C13 nuclei in their natural isotopic concentration. We calculate the system energetic and magnetic properties with ab initio methods based on the Density Functional Theory, identifying the neutral charge state of the silicon vacancy as the most favorable for p doped 3C SiC systems. We thereon evaluate the Free Induction Decay and the Hahn echo sequence on the electron spin interacting with the nuclear spin bath. Here, the Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation phenomenon, due to single nuclear spin flipping processes, and the overall decay are highlighted in the context of the Cluster Correlation Expansion theory. We find a non exponential coherence decay, which is a typical feature of solid state qubits subjected to low frequency 1/f noise from the environment.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Biomolecular Conformational Ensembles with PENSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions -- for example, with various mutations or bound ligands -- in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant for a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurizations and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, e.g., tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps to determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is one of the most relevant characteristics of systems of interest in nature and technology, ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle number through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we review complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying number of particles inspired by rather different specific numerical goals. As a result of the analysis on the underlying common structure of these models, we propose a unifying master equation for general dynamical systems with varying number of particles. This equation embeds all the previous models and can potentially model a much larger range of complex systems, ranging from molecular to social agent-based dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Ab Initio Hagedorn Wavepacket Dynamics: Single Vibronic Level Fluorescence Spectra of Difluorocarbene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepackets have been used to compute single vibronic level (SVL) spectra efficiently in model harmonic potentials. To make the Hagedorn approach practical for realistic polyatomic molecules with anharmonicity, here we combine local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics with on-the-fly ab initio dynamics. We then test this method by computing the SVL fluorescence spectra of difluorocarbene, a small, floppy molecule with a very anharmonic potential energy surface. Our time-dependent approach obtains the emission spectra of all initial vibrational levels from a single anharmonic semiclassical wavepacket trajectory without the need to fit individual anharmonic vibrational wavefunctions and to calculate the Franck-Condon factors for all vibronic transitions. We show that, whereas global harmonic models are inadequate for CF2, the spectra computed with the on-the-fly local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics agree well with experimental data, especially for low initial excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: API Phonons is a Python software package to predict the transport dynamics of heat-carrying phonons. Using the powerful syntax of Python, this package provides modules and functions interfacing between different packages for atomistic simulations, lattice dynamics, and phonon-phonon interaction calculations including LAMMPS, Quippy, Phonopy, and ShengBTE. API Phonons enabled complex phonon calculations, including (1) extracting harmonic and anharmonic force constants from arbitrary interatomic potentials, which can be used as inputs for solving Boltzmann transport equations; (2) predicting thermal conductivity using Kubo's linear response theory, which captures both quasiparticle transport and inter-band coherent transport; and (3) modeling of ultrafast pump-probe thermal responses using a Green's function approach based on mode-resolved phonon properties for studying ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport dynamics. The package provides a flexible, easy-to-use, and extensive platform for modeling phonon transport physics through Python programming.</description>

      <title>Transistors based on Novel 2-D Monolayer Semiconductors Bi2O2Se, InSe, and MoSi2N4 for Enhanced Logic Density Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making ultra-short gate-length transistors significantly contributes to scaling the contacted gate pitch. This, in turn, plays a vital role in achieving smaller standard logic cells for enhanced logic density scaling. As we push the boundaries of miniaturization, it is intriguing to consider that the ultimate limit of contacted gate pitch could be reached with remarkable 1 nm gate-length transistors. Here, we identify InSe, Bi2O2Se, and MoSi2N4 as potential two-dimensional semiconductors for 1 nm transistors with low contact resistance and outstanding interface properties. We employ a fully self-consistent ballistic quantum transport model starting from first-principle calculations. Our simulations show that the interplay between electrostatics and quantum tunneling influences the performance of these devices over the device design space. MoSi2N4 channels have the best immunity to quantum tunneling, and Bi2O2Se channel devices have the best electrostatics. We show that for a channel length of 12 nm, all the devices can deliver I_$ON$/I_$OFF$ &gt; 10^3 , suitable for electronic applications, and Bi2O2Se is the best-performing channel material.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional next-generation reservoir computing</title>

Abstract: Next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in spatio-temporal forecasting of complex systems and its ease of implementation. This paper shows that NG-RC can be encoded as a kernel ridge regression that makes training efficient and feasible even when the space of chosen polynomial features is very large. Additionally, an extension to an infinite number of covariates is possible, which makes the methodology agnostic with respect to the lags into the past that are considered as explanatory factors, as well as with respect to the number of polynomial covariates, an important hyperparameter in traditional NG-RC. We show that this approach has solid theoretical backing and good behavior based on kernel universality properties previously established in the literature. Various numerical illustrations show that these generalizations of NG-RC outperform the traditional approach in several forecasting applications.</description>
