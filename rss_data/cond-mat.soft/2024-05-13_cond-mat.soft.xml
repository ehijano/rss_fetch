      <title>Active Brownian particle under stochastic orientational resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ renewal processes to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of an active Brownian particle under stochastic orientational resetting. By computing the experimentally accessible intermediate scattering function (ISF) and reconstructing the full time-dependent distribution of the displacements, we study the interplay of rotational diffusion and resetting. The resetting process introduces a new spatiotemporal regime reflecting the directed motion of agents along the resetting direction at large length scales, which becomes apparent in an imaginary part of the ISF. We further derive analytical expressions for the low-order moments of the displacements and find that the variance displays an effective diffusive regime at long times, which decreases for increasing resetting rates. At intermediate times the dynamics are characterized by a negative skewness as well as a non-zero non-Gaussian parameter.</description>

      <title>Decoupling elasticity and electrical conductivity of carbon black gels filled with insulating non-Brownian grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unique bistable transition has been identified in granular/colloidal gel-composites, resulting from shear-induced phase separation of the gel phase into dense blobs. In energy applications, it is critical to understand how this transition influences electrical performance. Mixing conductive colloids with conductive inclusions, we find the conductivity and elasticity move in concert, both decreasing in the collapsed phase-separated state. Surprisingly, with insulating inclusions these properties can become decoupled, with the conductivity instead increasing despite the collapse of the gel structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a lattice model to probe the effect of active self-disassembly on equilibrium self-assembly. Surprisingly, we find conditions under which active self-disassembly enhances the yield of a target structure above that achieved by self-assembly alone when the latter is already favoured thermodynamically. We discuss biological implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>A continuum geometric approach for inverse design of origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Mechanics and thermodynamics of contractile biopolymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contractile biopolymer networks, such as the actomyosin meshwork of animal cells, are ubiquitous in living organisms. The active gel theory, which provides the thermodynamic framework for these materials, has been mostly used in conjunction with the assumption that the microstructure of the biopolymer network is based on rigid rods. However, experimentally, the actin network exhibits entropic elasticity. Here we combine an entropic elasticity kinetic theory, in the spirit of the Green and Tobolsky model of transiently crosslinked networks, with an active flux modelling biological activity. We determine this active flux using Onsager reciprocal relations and interpret the corresponding microscopic dynamics. We obtain a closed model of the macroscopic mechanical behaviour. We show how this model can be written using the framework of multiplicative strain gradient decomposition, which is convenient for the resolution of such problems.</description>

      <title>Reducing segregation in vibrated binary-sized granular mixtures by excessive small particle introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically examine binary-sized granular mixtures confined between two parallel walls subjected to vertical vibration using the discrete element method. For a size ratio of $3$ between large and small particles, we study the structure of large particles in regions where the combined two-dimensional packing fractions of both particle sizes surpass $1$. When the fraction of small particles is small, segregation of the large particles appears. In contrast, as the fraction of small particles increases, an effective repulsion between the large particles emerges over distances greater than the large particle diameter, suppressing their segregation. Further, this effective repulsion also induces a hexagonal phase of the large particles at packing fractions lower than in mono-component systems. This work will provide a fresh insight into granular physics, prompting further experimental and theoretical study.</description>

      <title>Orientational dynamics governs the pathways of entropic crystallization of Brownian squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dense systems of hard-interacting colloidal particles with anisotropic shapes, crystallization pathways represent an interesting frontier since directional entropic forces often cause fascinating variations in the equilibrium crystal structures. At increasing densities, when the orientational excluded volumes of anisotropic particles start overlapping, their translational and rotational dynamics become coupled, introducing complexities in the kinetics of their configurational reorganization, which facilitates ordering. To elucidate this, we have studied a two-dimensional system of osmotically compressed corner-rounded Brownian square platelets, which are known to equilibrate into hexagonal and rhombic crystalline phases as the osmotic pressure is increased. By analyzing the translational and orientational dynamics of the particles and calculating their corresponding contributions to minimize the free energy, we have shown that the accessible range of orientational diffusion of particles governs the pathways of structural evolution and consequent optimal equilibrium ordering at a given osmotic pressure. As the accessible orientational excursion becomes wider, the rotational contribution to configurational entropy minimizes the total free energy, leading to hexagonal ordering. At higher osmotic pressures, the long collective translational fluctuations of side-aligned particles with restricted rotational diffusion maximize entropy, thereby inducing a free energetically favored rhombic crystalline structure. Intriguingly, the density, which solely governs the crystallization of hard spheres, does not have any direct effect on this process. Complementary Brownian dynamics simulations further corroborate these experimental observations and interpretations. Our findings are also relevant to other systems of hard interacting anisotropic shapes in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Effect of annealed disorder on the plasticity of amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of annealed disorder on the mechanical properties and plasticity of a modeled amorphous solid by introducing a small fraction of heavy impurities into the material which resembles real experimental systems. The disorder being mobile, the total degrees of freedom and the potential energy landscape of the pure system are preserved in our model. The mechanical failure and the shear band formation in the amorphous solid in the presence of annealed disorder are studied at the microscopic level by employing the finite shear deformation protocol at nonzero temperature. A significant enhancement in the shear modulus and yield stress is observed as a function of the heaviness of the impurity particles. Via the analysis of the non-affine displacement field and the microscopic strain fluctuations and the nature of their spatial correlations we find that the shear band formation in the plastic regime is gradually suppressed with increasing impurity mass. Eventually, a critical mass of the disordered particles is identified above which the plastic events become completely localized. This is marked by a transition from a power law to an exponential decay in the spatial correlations non-affine displacement field. Likewise, a similar change is observed in the strain correlation function, transitioning from a slower $1/r$ decay to a more rapid $1/r^3$ decay. Finally, the effect shear rate on the plastic events in the presence of annealed disorder is explored.</description>

      <title>A replica theory for the dynamic glass transition of hardspheres with continuous polydispersity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassy soft matter is often continuously polydisperse, in which the sizes or various properties of the constituent particles are distributed continuously. However, most of the microscopic theories of the glass transition focus on the monodisperse particles. Here, we developed a replica theory for the dynamic glass transition of continuously polydisperse hardspheres. We focused on the limit of infinite spatial dimension, where replica theory becomes exact. In theory, the cage size $A$, which plays the role of an order parameter, appears to depend on the particle size $\sigma$, and thus, the effective free energy, the so-called Franz-Parisi potential, is a functional of $A(\sigma)$. We applied this theory to two fundamental systems: a nearly monodisperse system and an exponential distribution system. We found that dynamic decoupling occurs in both cases; the critical particle size $\sigma^{\ast}$ emerges, and larger particles with $\sigma \geq \sigma^{\ast}$ vitrify, while smaller particles $\sigma &lt; \sigma^{\ast}$ remain mobile. Moreover, the cage size $A(\sigma)$ exhibits a critical behavior at $\sigma \simeq \sigma^{\ast}$, originating from spinodal instability of $\sigma^{\ast}$-sized particles. We discuss the implications of these results for finite dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Langevin dynamics of rigid inclusions on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a rigid inclusion constrained to move on a curved surface has many applications in biological and soft matter physics, ranging from the diffusion of passive or active membrane proteins to the motion of phoretic particles on liquid-liquid interfaces. Here we construct intrinsic Langevin equations for an oriented rigid inclusion on a curved surface using Cartan's method of moving frames. We first derive the Hamiltonian equations of motion for the translational and rotational momenta in the body frame. Surprisingly, surface curvature couples the linear and angular momenta of the inclusion. We then add to the Hamiltonian equations linear friction, white noise and arbitrary configuration-dependent forces and torques to obtain intrinsic Langevin equations of motion in phase space. We provide the integrability conditions, made non-trivial by surface curvature, for the forces and torques to admit a potential, thus distinguishing between passive and active stochastic motion. We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation in geometric form and obtain fluctuation-dissipation relations that ensure Gibbsian equilibrium. We extract the overdamped equations of motion by adiabatically eliminating the momenta from the Fokker-Planck equation, showing how a peculiar cancellation leads to the naively expected Smoluchowski limit. The overdamped equations can be used for accurate and efficient intrinsic Brownian dynamics simulations of passive, driven and active diffusion processes on curved surfaces. Our work generalises to the collective dynamics of many inclusions on curved surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a generic description of the dynamics of cell aggregates. We describe cells as polar rotating objects which mechanically interact with each other and with the surrounding medium. We use the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics to derive generic constitutive equations for the interaction forces, torques and polarity dynamics. We apply our framework to discuss spontaneous motion of cell doublets. We find a rich phase diagram of possible collective motion, including steady rotation arising from flow-polarity coupling or coupling of polarity with cell position.</description>

      <title>High-frequency Optimally Windowed Chirp rheometry for rapidly evolving viscoelastic materials: application to a crosslinking thermoset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract
  Knowledge of the evolution of mechanical properties of the curing matrix is of great importance in composite parts or structure fabrication. Conventional rheometry, based on small amplitude oscillatory shear is limited by long interrogation times. In rapidly evolving materials, time sweeps can provide a meaningful measurement albeit at a single frequency. To overcome this constraint we utilize a combined frequency and amplitude-modulated chirped strain waveform in conjunction with a home-made sliding plate piezo-operated (PZR) and a dual-head commercial rotational rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 702) to probe the linear viscoelasticity of these time-evolving materials. The direct controllability of the PZR resulting from the absence of any kind of firmware and the microsecond actuator-sensor response renders this device ideal for exploring the advantages of this technique. The high frequency capability allows us to extend the upper limits of the accessible linear viscoelastic spectrum and most importantly, to shorten the length of the interrogating strain signal (OWCh-PZR) to sub-second scales, while retaining a high time-bandwidth product. This short duration ensures that the mutation number (NMu) is kept sufficiently low, even in fast curing resins. The method is validated via calibration tests in both instruments and the corresponding limitations are discussed. As a proof of concept the technique is applied to a curing vinylester resin. The linear viscoelastic (LVE) spectrum is assessed every 20 seconds to monitor the rapid evolution of the time- and frequency-dependence of the complex modulus. Finally, FTIR spectroscopy is utilized to gain insights on the evolution of the chemical network while the gap-dependence of the evolving material properties in these heterogeneous systems is also investigated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply optimal control theory to a model of a polar active fluid (the Toner-Tu model), with the objective of driving the system into particular emergent dynamical behaviors or programming switching between states on demand. We use the effective self-propulsion speed as the control parameter (i.e. the means of external actuation). We identify control protocols that achieve outcomes such as relocating asters to targeted positions, forcing propagating solitary waves to reorient to a particular direction, and switching between stationary asters and propagating fronts. We analyze the solutions to identify generic principles for controlling polar active fluids. Our findings have implications for achieving spatiotemporal control of active polar systems in experiments, particularly in vitro cytoskeletal systems. Additionally, this research paves the way for leveraging optimal control methods to engineer the structure and dynamics of active fluids more broadly.</description>

Abstract: The expression for the higher temperature dependence of the mean squared displacement in proteins is obtained. The quantum multi-well model explains the dynamic transitions of the proteins and minimizes the amount of parameters to a single one leading to the few-state harmonic system at low-temperatures, and, thus, justifying the possibility of using proteins as atom traps to control qubits at a bit higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>The structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure-dependent functional properties of Mn-containing perovskite nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of nanoparticles are determined by their size and structure. When exposed to external pressure P, their structural properties can change. The improvement or degradation of the properties of the samples depending on time is particularly interesting. The knowledge of the influence of structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure on the behavior of the compounds is essential for fundamental and applied purposes.Therefore, the first attempts have been made to shed light on how the functional properties of the Mn-containing perovskites change depending on them. The nanoparticles of different sizes, from 20 to 70 nm, have been obtained. After 3 years, their structural properties underwent significant changes, including an increase in particle size, bandwidth, and microstrains, as well as a reduction in dislocation density.The greatest change in the structure is observed for the smallest nanoparticles. The phase transition temperatures increase with nanoparticle size, time, and pressure. The aging time has the strongest influence on the changing Curie temperature for the smallest and most magnetically inhomogeneous nanoparticles with dTc/dP = 100 K / GPa. Conversely, the structural-size effect and external pressure have the greatest influence on the biggest and most magnetically uniform nanoparticles with dTc/dP = 91 and 16 K / GPa, respectively. After 3 years, the biggest nanoparticles demonstrate the most stable phase transition temperatures with improved magnetocaloric parameters near room temperature. These structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure are powerful instruments to tune the phase transition temperatures and magnetocaloric effect of the nanoparticles. These outcomes may have implications for the whole class of perovskites and could initiate a new mainstream.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a binary mixture of sticky spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the dependence of range of attractive potential on the phase separation of 2-D binary systems. Through extensive simulations and analysis, we show that when the range of attractive interactions approaches the sticky sphere limit, the system undergoes a phase separation at lower temperature. Further reduction in temperature causes the system to mix again. These mixing-demixing-mixing transitions are of first order. Such phase separation is not observed for systems with larger interaction range. In the phase separated region of the phase diagram, one of the components of the mixture chooses to be in crystalline configuration, while other being in disordered state</description>

Abstract: The mechanisms leading cells to acquire a fitness advantage and establish themselves in a population are paramount to understanding the development and growth of cancer. Although there are many works that study separately either the evolutionary dynamics or the mechanics of cancer, little has been done to couple evolutionary dynamics to mechanics. To address this question, we study a confluent model of tissue using a Self-Propelled Voronoi (SPV) model with stochastic growth rates that depend on the mechanical variables of the system. The SPV model is an out-of-equilibrium model of tissue derived from an energy functional that has a jamming/unjamming transition between solid-like and liquid-like states. By considering several scenarios of mutants invading a resident population in both phases, we determine the range of parameters that confer a fitness advantage and show that the preferred area and perimeter are the most relevant ones. We find that the liquid-like state is more resistant to invasion and show that the outcome of the competition can be determined from the simulation of a non-growing mixture. Moreover, a mean-field approximation can accurately predict the fate of a mutation affecting mechanical properties of a cell. Our results can be used to infer evolutionary dynamics from tissue images, understand cancer-suppressing effects of tissue mechanics, and even search for mechanics-based therapies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic nanoswimmer: a multistate model for enzyme self-propulsion and enhanced diffusion</title>

Abstract: Several enzymes exhibit enhanced diffusion in the presence of a substrate. One explanation of this enhancement arises from fluctuating dimer models, which suggest that enzymes have a higher diffusion constant when interacting with substrates compared to when they are free. Another possible mechanism, suggested in both experimental and theoretical studies, is that enzymes act as nanoswimmers. However, existing nanoswimmer models have struggled to account for the exceptionally high self-propulsion speeds observed in experiments, with estimated increases in diffusion due to self-propulsion found to be minimal. In this study, we model enzymes as dimers with fluctuating mobility. We show that even dimers can exhibit run-and-tumble motion when transitioning between states of varying mobility within the enzymatic cycle. By exploring a three-state enzymatic cycle, we identify the conditions under which self-propulsion speeds and increases in diffusion rate consistent with experimental observations can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>

Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>
