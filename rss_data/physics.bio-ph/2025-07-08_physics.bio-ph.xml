      <title>Hydrodynamic Trapping of Tracer Particles Induced by Spatially Correlated Noise in Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell &gt; r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell&gt;r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Guided Multiscale Design of DNA-functionalized Nanoparticles for Targeted Self-Assembly of the Double Gyroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In soft matter science, it is often the goal to design new materials with targeted properties. These materials can be used in many applications, each requiring specific features to be optimized for maximum fitness. The use of self-assembly processes, where a target structure is attained from suitably designed building blocks, is a powerful tool for this optimization. However, it is still an open question how to generally design realizable building blocks that lead to the desired phases. In this work, the double gyroid is chosen as target structure and DNA functionalized nanoparticles are used as our building blocks. Using existing pair potentials as inspiration, a large design space is defined for exploration of the target structure. An effective search strategy is implemented, where free energy calculations are first used to coarse grain our originally fine-grained model of the building blocks and then quickly evaluate the fitness of each design. These data are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that allows obtaining predictions for all candidates in our design space through an active learning loop. Successful coarse-grained designs are identified and evaluated again through interfacial pinning calculations with the fine-grained model. This work leads to the development of specific, experimentally relevant designs of DNA functionalized nanoparticles that self-assembly into the target phase. The methodology used can be extended to other types of building blocks and target structures.</description>

      <title>Aubry-Andr\'e Transition for an Active Undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of deformable self-propelling objects like bacteria, worms, snakes, and robots through heterogeneous environments is poorly understood. In this paper, we use experiment, simulation, and theory to study a snake-like robot as it undulates without sensory feedback through a narrow channel containing a linear array of boulder-like hemispherical obstacles. The profile of the boulder landscape approximates a one-dimensional bichromatic potential introduced by Aubry and Andr\'e (AA) to study the propagation and localization of waves. When the boulder landscape is strictly periodic, the robot can pass completely through the channel. But if the landscape is sufficiently aperiodic, the robot can become trapped and fail to exit the channel. The metrics we use to quantify this change agree well with earlier experimental and theoretical work on a localization transition that occurs when quantum waves interact with the AA potential. A theoretical treatment of the robot's motion using resistive force theory modified to include spatially varying drag forces reproduces the behavior we observe.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Swarms Durability to Threats via Graph Signal Processing and GNN-based Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarms, such as schools of fish or drone formations, are prevalent in both natural and engineered systems. While previous works have focused on the social interactions within swarms, the role of external perturbations--such as environmental changes, predators, or communication breakdowns--in affecting swarm stability is not fully understood. Our study addresses this gap by modeling swarms as graphs and applying graph signal processing techniques to analyze perturbations as signals on these graphs. By examining predation, we uncover a "detectability-durability trade-off", demonstrating a tension between a swarm's ability to evade detection and its resilience to predation, once detected. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this trade-off, explicitly tying it to properties of the swarm's spatial configuration. Toward task-specific optimized swarms, we introduce SwaGen, a graph neural network-based generative model. We apply SwaGen to resilient swarm generation by defining a task-specific loss function, optimizing the contradicting trade-off terms simultaneously.With this, SwaGen reveals novel spatial configurations, optimizing the trade-off at both ends. Applying the model can guide the design of robust artificial swarms and deepen our understanding of natural swarm dynamics.</description>

      <title>Latent Thermodynamic Flows: Unified Representation Learning and Generative Modeling of Temperature-Dependent Behaviors from Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work, we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow, important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive computational results.</description>

      <title>Intestinal villi and crypts density maximizing nutrient absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The villi and crypts of the gastrointestinal tract increase the effective surface area of the intestinal mucosa, potentially enhancing nutrient absorption. It is commonly assumed that this is their primary function, and that a higher villi density necessarily leads to improved absorption. However, when villi are packed too closely together, diffusion can be hindered, potentially offsetting this benefit. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the density of these structures and the overall efficiency of absorption. In three different simplified geometries, approximating crypts, leaf-like villi, and finger-like villi we calculate analytically the concentration profile and the absorption flux, assuming that there is only diffusion between these structures while the lumen is well mixed. When plotting the absorption flux per unit of gut length as a function of the structures' density, we observe that there is a density maximizing absorption. We study numerically this optimum. It depends weakly on the absorption properties of the given nutrient, so that a geometry optimal for one nutrient is close to optimum for another nutrient. Physiological data from various animal species align with this predicted optimal range and potentially reflect evolutionary selection for efficient nutrient uptake, supporting the model's validity.</description>

      <title>Local entropy production rate of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local entropy production rate and the local entropy flow in active systems composed of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles in a thermal bath. After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria, cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy of a Photosynthetic Reaction Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and F\"orster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing for genomics: conceptual challenges and practical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the potential of quantum computing to accelerate computation of central tasks in genomics, focusing on often-neglected theoretical limitations. We discuss state-of-the-art challenges of quantum search, optimization, and machine learning algorithms. Examining database search with Grover's algorithm, we show that the expected speedup vanishes under realistic assumptions. For combinatorial optimization prevalent in genomics, we discuss the limitations of theoretical complexity in practice and suggest carefully identifying problems genuinely suited for quantum acceleration. Given the competition from excellent classical approximate solvers, quantum computing could offer a speedup in the near future only for a specific subset of hard enough tasks in assembly, gene selection, and inference. These tasks need to be characterized by core optimization problems that are particularly challenging for classical methods while requiring relatively limited variables. We emphasize rigorous empirical validation through runtime scaling analysis to avoid misleading claims of quantum advantage. Finally, we discuss the problem of trainability and data-loading in quantum machine learning. This work advocates for a balanced perspective on quantum computing in genomics, guiding future research toward targeted applications and robust validation.</description>

      <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Differential Dynamic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Intuitive dissection of the Gaussian information bottleneck method with an application to optimal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Characterization of Melanoma Cells Using Brillouin Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, Brillouin spectroscopy was employed to investigate the viscoelastic properties of melanoma cells in vitro. Using a custom-built confocal Brillouin microspectrometer, we obtained Brillouin shifts and full width at half maximum (FWHM) values, enabling the non-invasive assessment of cellular stiffness and viscosity. The Brillouin spectra revealed the biomechanical characteristics of melanoma cells, with measured shifts and FWHM values providing a detailed viscoelastic profile. These findings demonstrate the capability of Brillouin microscopy to probe the mechanical properties of cancer cells at the subcellular level. This technique holds significant potential for advancing cancer research by providing insights into the mechanical behavior of melanoma cells, which could inform the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies based on cellular biomechanics.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale cuticle mass density variations influenced by pigmentation in butterfly wing scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16628v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How pigment distribution influences the cuticle density within a microscopic butterfly wing scale, and how both impact each scale's final reflected color, remains unknown. We use ptychographic X-ray computed tomography to quantitatively determine, at nanoscale resolutions, the three-dimensional mass density of scales with pigmentation differences. By comparing cuticle densities between two pairs of scales with pigmentation differences, we determine that the density of the lower lamina is inversely correlated with pigmentation. In the upper lamina structure of Junonia orithya and Bicyclus anynana, low pigment levels also correlate with sheet-like chitin structures as opposed to rod-like structures. Within each scale, we determine that the lower lamina in all scales has the highest density, and distinct layers within the lower lamina help explain reflected color. We hypothesize that pigments, in addition to absorbing specific wavelengths, can affect cuticle polymerization, density, and refractive index, thereby impacting reflected wavelengths that produce colors.</description>

      <title>Extreme scaling of the metadynamics of paths algorithm on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD)-based path sampling algorithms are a very important class of methods used to study the energetics and kinetics of rare (bio)molecular events. They sample the highly informative but highly unlikely reactive trajectories connecting different metastable states of complex (bio)molecular systems. The metadynamics of paths (MoP) method proposed by Mandelli, Hirshberg, and Parrinello [Pys. Rev. Lett. 125 2, 026001 (2020)] is based on the Onsager-Machlup path integral formalism. This provides an analytical expression for the probability of sampling stochastic trajectories of given duration. In practice, the method samples reactive paths via metadynamics simulations performed directly in the phase space of all possible trajectories. Its parallel implementation is in principle infinitely scalable, allowing arbitrarily long trajectories to be simulated. Paving the way for future applications to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-ligand (un)binding, a problem of great pharmaceutical interest, we present here the efficient implementation of MoP in the HPC-oriented biomolecular simulation software GROMACS. Our benchmarks on a membrane protein (150,000 atoms) show an unprecedented weak scaling parallel efficiency of over 70% up to 3200 GPUs on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster machine at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Center.</description>

Abstract: It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.</description>

      <title>Rheologically tuned modes of collective transport in active viscoelastic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While many living biological media combine both viscous and elastic properties, most theoretical studies employ either purely fluid- or solid-like descriptions. We here use a unified framework for active films on substrates capable of describing a broad range of viscoelastic behavior to explore the interplay between activity and rheology. The core of the study is a comprehensive state diagram showing a rich world of spatiotemporal dynamic states. Our results demonstrate the potential of tunable rheology to realize modes of controlled active transport on the microscale.</description>
