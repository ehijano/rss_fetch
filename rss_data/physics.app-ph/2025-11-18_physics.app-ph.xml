      <title>Data-Driven Design Rules for TADF Emitters from a High-Throughput Screening of 747 Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rational design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is hindered by a complex interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic factors. To unravel these relationships, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis of \num{747} experimentally known TADF molecules to establish large-scale, quantitative design principles. Our validated semi-empirical protocol systematically reveals how molecular architecture, conformational geometry, and electronic structure govern photophysical properties. We establish a clear performance hierarchy, with Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures being statistically superior for minimizing the singlet-triplet energy gap ($\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$). Crucially, we identify an optimal D-A torsional angle window of \qtyrange{50}{90}{\degree} that resolves the key trade-off between a small $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}$ and the non-zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC) required for efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). Data-driven clustering further identifies a distinct family of high-performance candidates and confirms Multi-Resonance (MR) emitters as a unique paradigm for high-efficiency blue emission. These findings culminate in a set of actionable design rules and the identification of \num{127} high-priority candidates predicted to have $\Delta E_{\text{ST}}&lt; \qty{0.1}{\electronvolt}$ and oscillator strength $f \num{&gt; 0.1}$. This work provides a data-driven framework that unifies thermodynamic and kinetic principles to accelerate the discovery of next-generation TADF emitters.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of cyclic behavior in quasi-brittle materials: a micromechanics-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the micromechanics-based phase-field modeling of fatigue fracture to capture cyclic plasticity with ratcheting. This mechanism is particularly important for low-cycle fatigue, where the accumulation of inelastic strains plays an important role in the progression to final failure. The ratcheting contribution is formulated through the evolution of ratcheting strain, which accumulates over loading cycles and captures the inelastic strain growth characteristic of cyclic plasticity in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The extended plastic potential allows independent control over deviatoric and volumetric ratcheting components, ensuring smooth evolution of the free energy and its derivatives. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the model under both monotonic and cyclic loading and to assess the influence of ratcheting on material response.</description>

      <title>Mechanosensitive polymer matrices of biologically-relevant compliance based on upconverting nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising optical biomechanical force sensors due to their near infrared excitation, low toxicity, photostability, and linear colorimetric sensitivity to micronewtons of force. Recently, a composite force sensor based on UCNPs embedded in a polystyrene microbead enabled the first real time measurement of feeding forces in living nematodes. However, the comparatively large stiffness of polystyrene only makes it relevant to biomedical application in a small subset of biological tissue. To facilitate deployment of UCNPs into biological tissues with a range of mechanical properties, we expand upon polymer UCNP composite systems by embedding UCNPs in three polymer matrices with varying stiffnesses (epoxy resin, polydimethylsiloxane, and alginate hydrogels). Furthermore, to enhance these composites mechanosensitivity, we methodically investigate using two different core-shell architectures of SrLuF based UCNPs doped with ytterbium, erbium, and varying manganese concentrations. We calibrate polymer UCNP composite optical force sensitivity with colocalized atomic force and confocal microscopy. Using the red to green emission ratio (Delta Percent IRed:IGreen) as the force read-out, we determine that SrLuF:Yb0.28Er0.025Mn0.013 with SrYF inert shell dispersed in epoxy resin exhibits the greatest emission color change (12 Delta Percent IRed:IGreen per microNewton). Finally, we map forces in the epoxy UCNP composite on the macroscale between the joint of a chicken wing bone using a commercially available wide field microscope, thereby demonstrating its ability to optically measure pressures in situ. This work establishes the utility and modularity of the UCNP polymer composite system for force sensing in geometrically and mechanically diverse biological systems.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Photoelastic Imaging for Three-Dimensional Stress Estimation in a Transparent Cubical Block</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional photoelastic methods are largely limited to two-dimensional stress visualization, leaving a gap in techniques that can capture three-dimensional force interactions with high sensitivity at low stress levels, a capability that is critical for biomechanics and dynamic force analysis. This study develops and demonstrates a cubic photoelastic model that enables accurate fringe-order estimation from three orthogonal views, providing a foundation for reconstructing full three-dimensional stress states. A transparent, low-elasticity epoxy cube, free of prestress, was fabricated and examined using combined transmission and reflection photoelastic imaging. Three mutually orthogonal isochromatic fringe fields were recorded simultaneously under a single applied load. Image analysis employed a peak-valley intensity method to extract sub-fringe orders and to resolve low-stress cases with minimal noise. The cubic block produced high-quality fringe patterns in all directions, enabling separation of tangential and normal stress components. Independent orthogonal views confirmed directional sensitivity and yielded consistent fringe-order estimates under low loading, with response times on the order of tens of microseconds. These results establish a practical approach for three-dimensional photoelastic stress measurement from orthogonal views and create a pathway toward full vector force reconstruction with strong potential for biomedical applications and studies of dynamic loading.</description>

      <title>A High-Efficiency Microwave Power Combining System Based on Frequency-Tuning Injection-Locked Magnetrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To increase the power level and energy utilization rate of injection-locked magnetron sources, a dual way 1-kW S-band magnetron microwave power combining system with high combining efficiency was proposed and validated. A waveguide magic-Tee was used to achieve power combining and to provide a pathway for the reference signal. This system utilizes the power-dividing characteristic of a magic-Tee to lock two magnetrons. Frequency tuning is applied to adjust the phase difference between the two magnetrons' signals so as to achieve a high combining efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the microwave power combining efficiency of the proposed system reaches 94.5%. The attenuation of microwave power is caused only by the waveguides and magic-Tee. Our investigation provides a guideline for future high-power microwave combining systems with low losses.</description>

      <title>In-memory phononic learning toward cognitive mechanical intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern autonomous systems are driving the critical need for next-generation adaptive materials and structures with embodied intelligence, i.e., the embodiment of memory, perception, learning, and decision-making within the mechanical domain. A fundamental challenge is the seamless and efficient integration of memory with information processing in a physically interpretable way that enables cognitive learning and decision-making under uncertainty. Prevailing paradigms, from intricate logic cascades to black-box morphological computing or physical neural networks, are seriously limited by trade-offs among efficiency, scalability, interpretability, transparency, and reliance on additional electronics. Here, we introduce in-memory phononic learning, a paradigm-shifting framework that unifies nonvolatile mechanical memory with wave-based perception within a phononic metastructure. Our system encodes spatial information into stable structural states as mechanical memory that directly programs its elastic wave-propagation landscape. This memory/wave-dynamics coupling enables effective sensory perception, decomposing complex patterns into informative geometric features through frequency-selective wave localization. Learning is created by optimizing input waveforms to selectively probe these features for memory-pattern classification, with decisions inferred directly from the output wave energy, thereby completing the entire information loop mechanically through an efficient and physically transparent mechanism without hidden architectures or electronics. This work transcends the paradigm of 'materials that compute' to cognitive matter capable of interpreting dynamic environments, paving the way for future intelligent structural-material systems with low power consumption, more direct interaction with surroundings, and enhanced cybersecurity and resilience in harsh conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast propagation of magnon-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization lies at the heart of spintronic and magnonic technologies, with the ultimate performance of such systems limited by the velocity at which magnetic excitations can propagate. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast propagation of magnon-polaritons-hybrid quasiparticles arising from the coupling between spin waves and electromagnetic fields in thin pure, bismuth-, and gallium substituted yttrium iron garnet (YIG, Bi:YIG and Ga:YIG) films. Using time- and phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy and time-resolved scanning transmission microscopy, we show that magnon-polaritons can propagate faster than 100 km/s, nearly three orders of magnitude more than conventional spin waves, and can be observed at distances exceeding 40 micrometers in 20 nm thick films. Analytical modeling based on retarded Maxwell equations and Polder tensor formalism confirms the hybridized nature of the excitations and captures the nontrivial dispersion and attenuation profiles. Notably, the magnon-polaritons maintain high initial magnetization amplitudes and long decay lengths, enabling ultrafast manipulation of the magnetization far away from the excitation source. We show, that they can move domain walls or stabilize nonlinear magnetization processes. The unprecedentedly high propagation velocities make magnon-polaritons promising candidates for high-speed information transfer in future spin-based computing architectures, potentially overcoming long-standing group delay bottlenecks in magnonic logic circuits.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Impacts of Three Types of Plasma-Activated Water on the Seed Germination and Plant Growth of Lettuce (Lactuca sativa)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold air plasma typically generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), which are transported into water to produce plasma-activated water (PAW). This study examines the effect of PAW produced by three different plasma systems on lettuce: transient spark, fountain dielectric barrier discharge, and microwave plasma. Physiochemical PAW properties and concentrations of RONS (ozone, hydrogen peroxide, nitrite, and nitrate) were measured. Seed germination parameters were recorded in 8-day paper tests. The effect of PAW irrigation was investigated after 6 weeks of plant growth in the soil by measuring the germination rate, plant and root length, dry and fresh plant weight, number of leaves, and photosynthetic pigments. PAW, dependent upon its RONS contents, enhances plant development and affects its physiological parameters.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic qubits stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as platforms for qubits and quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation departs from the classical paradigm of deterministic, bit-based processing by exploiting inherently quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an all-optical quantum-enhanced diagnostic for electric fields in low-temperature plasmas. Trace amounts of rubidium vapor, added to argon plasma, allow us to produce spectrally narrow electric field-sensitive optical resonances via quantum optical effect of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, and to non-invasively measure electric field in plasma with sensitivity exceeding 1 V/cm. By collecting fluorescence from the illuminated region of interest, we reconstruct a 2D spatial profile of the electric field magnitude with $30~\mu$m resolution. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we measured the changes in electric field within the plasma sheath surrounding a biased Langmuir probe tip. This method holds significant potential for studying sheath structures in low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <title>Eardrum sound pressure prediction from ear canal reflectance based on the inverse solution of Webster's horn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To derive ear canal transfer functions for individualized equalization algorithms of in-ear hearing systems, individual ear canal models are needed. In a one-dimensional approach, this requires the estimation of the individual area function of the ear canal. The area function can be effectively and reproducibly calculated as the inverse solution of Webster's horn equation by finite difference approximation of the time domain reflectance. Building upon previous research, the present study further investigates the termination of the approximation at an optimal spatial resolution, addressing the absence of higher frequencies in typical ear canal measurements and enhancing the accuracy of the inverse solution. Compared to the geometric reference, more precise area functions were achieved by extrapolating simulated input impedances of ear canal geometries up to a frequency of 3.5 MHz, corresponding to 0.1 mm spatial resolution. The low pass of the previous work was adopted but adjusted for its cut-off frequency depending on the highest frequency of the band-limited input impedance. Robust criteria for terminating the area function at the approximated ear canal length were found. Finally, three-dimensional simulated and measured ear canal transfer impedances were replicated well employing the previously introduced and herein validated one-dimensional electro-acoustic model fed by the area functions.</description>

      <title>Electron Tunneling Enhances Thermal Conductance through Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of interfaces in semiconductor devices substantially hinders thermal transport, contributing disproportionately to the overall thermal resistance. However, approaches to enhance interfacial thermal transport remain scarce without changing the interface structure, as the intrinsic electron and phonon properties of constituent materials set an upper limit. Here, we find a new thermal transport pathway, electronic heat tunneling, to enhance interfacial thermal conductance through metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions. By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux. Our Letter demonstrates a previously unexplored heat transport mechanism to enhance thermal conductance, bypassing the need for interface engineering. These findings emphasize the essential need to understand semiconductor thermal properties under realistic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Distortion-Driven Carrier Decoupling in Doped LiMgPO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Lattice Thermal Transport Beyond the Quasiparticle Approximation: Nontrivial Spectral Competition between Three- and Four-Phonon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breakdown of the quasiparticle approximation (QPA) for phonons in strongly anharmonic materials necessitates advanced first-principles frameworks for accurate lattice dynamics and thermal transport predictions. We develop a comprehensive beyond-quasiparticle approximation (BQPA) approach incorporating both three- (3ph) and four-phonon (4ph) interactions and apply it to investigate lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) in MgO, PbTe, and AgCl -- materials that span a broad spectrum of anharmonicity, from weak to severe anharmonic regimes with overdamped phonons. We reveal that while BQPA consistently increases $\kappa_{\rm L}$ relative to QPA due to phonon softening when considering only 3ph interactions, the inclusion of additional 4ph interactions hardens the phonon spectrum and suppresses this enhancement, bringing BQPA and QPA predictions into close agreement via subtle spectral competition effects across all three compounds. These findings highlight that accurate modeling of $\kappa_{\rm L}$ in strongly anharmonic materials requires treating both full phonon spectral function and higher-order anharmonicity on equal footing. Our work establishes a systematic framework for modeling thermal transport in systems with overdamped phonons and provides critical insights for materials design beyond the limits of conventional phonon transport theory.</description>

      <title>Signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbon embedded in h-BN lattice</title>

Abstract: Zigzag edges of graphene have long been predicted to exhibit magnetic electronic state near the Fermi level, which can cause spin-related phenomena and offer unique potentials for graphene-based spintronics. However, the magnetic conduction channels along these edges have yet been reported experimentally. Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-P\'erot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 {\Omega}, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Electrical isolation is critical to ensure safety and minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously transmit power and signals through a unified channel. Here we demonstrate a mechanically-isolated gate driver based on microwave-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) device on lithium niobate that achieves galvanic isolation of 2.75 kV with ultralow isolation capacitance (0.032 pF) over 1.25 mm mechanical propagation length, delivering 13.4 V open-circuit voltage and 44.4 mA short-circuit current. We demonstrate isolated gate driving for a gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistor, achieving a turn-on time of 108.8 ns comparable to commercial drivers and validate its operation in a buck converter. In addition, our SAW device operates over an ultrawide temperature range from 0.5 K (-272.6 {\deg}C) to 544 K (271 {\deg}C). The microwave-frequency SAW devices offer inherent EMI immunity and potential for heterogeneous integration on multiple semiconductor platforms, enabling compact, high-performance isolated power and signal transmission in advanced power electronics.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Microscope-coupled Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers for CW and Modulated Light Emission Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of low power infrared light emission spectra from microstructures can be challenging, but is of key importance in several research fields. Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (FTIR) can be used for characterizing such weak light emitters, but this requires additional custom user calibration compared to traditional FTIR measurements of, e.g., transmission or reflection. These calibration techniques are well documented for standalone FTIR instruments but not for microscope coupled-FTIRs, even though such an architecture greatly simplifies collection of light from micro and nano scale structures. We propose and demonstrate a calibration method for microsope-FTIRs based on the well-known emissivity of doped silicon at high temperature. With this method, we measure responsivity and noise floor of a recently installed microscope-FTIR instrument (Bruker\textsuperscript{\textcopyright} Invenio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} R coupled with a Hyperion II microscope), which is found to be within theoretically predicted values. The method is demonstrated for two different detectors (Mercury Cadmium Telluride and Indium Antimonide), in both continuous wave (CW) and modulated (step-scan) emission measurements mode.</description>

      <title>A High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>

      <title>An 11.7-GHz ScAlN FBAR Filter: Case Study on Scaling Limits and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports an 11.7 GHz compact 50 ohm ladder filter based on single layer Scandium Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) with platinum (Pt) electrodes, and uses it as a quantitative case study of the limits encountered when directly scaling to higher frequencies. The measured filter achieves a 3 dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 4.0% and an out of band rejection greater than 23.1 dB, with a minimum insertion loss (IL) of 6.8 dB. We analyze the origin of this performance through a quantitative framework: (1) a loss decomposition study, (2) frequency shift sensitivity that explains the discrepancy between simulated and measured center frequency, (3) FBW sensitivity to series shunt separation and port impedance, and (4) stress limited aperture that constrains device size. The results establish a realistic, fabricable baseline for directly scaled single layer ScAlN FBAR filters and outline materials, electrode, and stress management directions toward lower loss mmWave acoustic filters.</description>

      <title>Observation of Fine Structure in Channeling of Particles in Bent Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observed highly efficient manipulation of the 530 MeV positron beam at Mainz Microtron via bent crystals. The low beam divergence revealed a fine structure in the angular distribution of channeled particles. A compact analytical model, supported by Monte Carlo including multiple scattering, accounts for the measurements. We established a criterion for designing a crystal with reduced angular spread of channeled particles for beam manipulation at any energy. This finding is particularly useful in view of applications of channeling to the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles in an absorbing medium: modeling with experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium are essential in understanding the overall properties of composites and in designing materials with expected functionalities. In this paper, we establish a model based on both Kubelka-Munk theory and Mie theory that links the absorption and scattering properties of individual particles with the reflectance and transmittance spectra of its thin-film composite, supported by detailed experiments. Thin films consisting of TiO$_2$ nanoparticles embedded in PMMA are fabricated on glass substrates using spin-coating and then peeled off to form standalone samples for spectroscopy measurements. By using the Kubelka-Munk theory in combination with the Saunderson correction, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients of multiple nanoparticles are extracted from the measured transmittance and reflectance. On the other hand, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients are the sum of absorption and scattering cross-sections of individual particles, which are calculated from the Mie theory specified for particles in an absorbing medium, with the scattering $S$ coefficient further modulated by the anisotropy factor $g$. The effect of the particulate medium is incorporated through an effective refractive index. The overall model is validated by matching well between the $K-S$ coefficients extracted from experimental data and theoretical calculations. This agreement provides deep insight into the significant attenuating effect of absorption and scattering on each particle due to the surrounding medium. The validated model of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium can be used to obtain preliminary results for materials designed in a number of applications, such as radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>Three Strongly Coupled Kerr Parametric Oscillators Forming a Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are a promising resource for classical and quantum analog computation, for example to find the ground state of Ising Hamiltonians. Yet, the state space of strongly coupled KPO networks is very involved. As such, their phase diagram sometimes features either too few or too many states, including some that cannot be mapped to Ising spin configurations. This complexity makes it challenging to find and meet the conditions under which an analog optimization algorithm can be successful. Here, we demonstrate how to use three strongly coupled KPOs as a simulator for an Ising Hamiltonian, and estimate its ground state using a Boltzmann sampling measurement. While fully classical, our work is directly relevant for quantum systems operating on coherent states.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5 x 10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in very low and low lunar orbits (vLLO/LLO), in elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs), at the Earth-Moon L1 point, and in near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are sufficient to achieve 5 x 10^{-18} fractional stability for deep cislunar regimes (e.g., NRHO, Earth-Moon L1), supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation; near-surface and vLLO realizations generally require a much higher spherical-harmonic degree, l_max &gt;= 300, to meet the same stability goal. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>
