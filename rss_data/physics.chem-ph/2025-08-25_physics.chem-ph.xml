      <title>Node-Equivariant Message Passing for Efficient and Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials, particularly equivariant message-passing (MP) models, have demonstrated high fidelity in representing first-principles data, revolutionizing computational studies in materials science, biophysics, and catalysis. However, these equivariant MP models still incur substantial computational and memory needs due to their expensive tensor product operations over edge space, significantly limiting their applicability in large-scale or long-time simulations. In this work, we propose a node-equivariant MP (NEMP) framework that performs equivariant operations between the central node and a virtual summed node encoding structure information of its neighbors. Crucially, NEMP maintains comparable or even superior accuracy across diverse test systems-including molecules, extended systems, and universal potential benchmarks-while achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude reduction in memory and computational costs compared to edge equivariant MP models. In fact, NEMP reaches computational efficiency comparable to that of local descriptor-based models, and enabling previously inaccessible large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Spectra of Materials and Molecules from Partially-Adiabatic Elevated-Temperature Centroid Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) incorporates nuclear quantum statistics into the calculation of vibrational spectra. However, when performed in Cartesian coordinates, CMD shows serious unphysical artifacts in certain vibrational bands, known as the curvature problem. Recent work showed that CMD spectra can be freed from the curvature problem by evolving the ring-polymer centroid on a potential of mean force (PMF) calculated at an elevated temperature ($T_e$-CMD). Here we present a partially-adiabatic implementation of $T_e$-CMD (PA-$T_e$-CMD), which eliminates the need for precomputed PMFs and instead yields the centroid force \textit{on-the-fly}. We introduce a two-temperature path-integral Langevin thermostat to achieve a temperature separation between centroid and internal modes of the ring-polymer. Because it is paramount that the elevated temperature be chosen as low as possible for a given physical temperature in this formulation, we present a general scheme for its determination. We benchmark PA-$T_e$-CMD against exact vibrational spectra for the isolated water monomer and discuss its performance for challenging anharmonic systems: the carbonic acid fluoride molecule (CAF) and the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPI). We conclude that PA-$T_e$-CMD mitigates the curvature problem and eliminates the steep increase in computational cost with decreasing temperature of conventional path-integral methods. We observe some energy leakage from the hot internal modes to high-frequency centroid modes at low physical temperatures. Nevertheless, compared to other imaginary path-integral approximate methods, the PA-$T_e$-CMD spectra show more accurate lineshapes. While a fully adiabatic setup based on a coarse-grained centroid PMF is still preferable when a good pre-trained PMF can be easily obtained, PA-$T_e$-CMD presents a low-barrier single-shot setup for any system.</description>

      <title>Double excitations in molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>SpinAdaptedSecondQuantization.jl 1.0 -- A Simple and Pedagogical Approach to Symbolic Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16342v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of new electronic structure methods is a very time consuming and error prone process when done by hand. SpinAdaptedSecondQuantization is an open-source Julia package we have developed for working with automated electronic structure theory development. The code focuses on being user-friendly and extensible, allowing for easy use of both user- and pre-defined fermionic and/or bosonic operators, tensors, and orbital spaces. This allows the code to be used to efficiently investigate and prototype new electronic structure methods for many different types of systems. This includes both exotic systems with wave functions consisting of different kinds of particles at once, as well as new parametrizations for traditional many-electron systems. The code is spin-adapted, working directly with spin-adapted fermionic operators, and can easily be used to derive common electronic structure theory equations and expressions, such as the coupled cluster energy, ground and excited state equations, one- and two-electron density matrices, etc. Additionally, the code can translate expressions into code, accelerating the process of going from ideas to implemented methods.</description>

      <title>Global properties of the energy landscape: a testing and training arena for machine learned potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have achieved remarkable accuracy on standard benchmarks, yet their ability to reproduce molecular kinetics -- critical for reaction rate calculations -- remains largely unexplored. We introduce Landscape17, a dataset of complete kinetic transition networks (KTNs) for the molecules of the MD17 dataset, computed using hybrid-level density functional theory. Each KTN contains minima, transition states, and approximate steepest-descent paths, along with energies, forces, and Hessian eigenspectra at stationary points. We develop a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the MLIP ability to reproduce these reference landscapes and apply it to a number of state-of-the-art architectures. Our results reveal limitations in current MLIPs: all the models considered miss over half of the DFT transition states and generate stable unphysical structures throughout the potential energy surface. Data augmentation with pathway configurations improves reproduction of DFT potential energy surfaces, resulting in significant improvement in the global kinetics. However, these models still produce many spurious stable structures, indicating that current MLIP architectures face underlying challenges in capturing the topology of molecular potential energy surfaces. The Landscape17 benchmark provides a straightforward but demanding test of MLIPs for kinetic applications, requiring only up to a few hours of compute time. We propose this test for validation of next-generation MLIPs targeting reaction discovery and rate prediction.</description>

      <title>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that not only includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) but also accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Conformational Control of the Spectroscopic Properties of Multi-Layer and Multi-Defect Carbon Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence (PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of CDs of complex CDs with multiple layers and multiples defects are determined by their structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing groups, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing groups, such as hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission, except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing groups. We find that not only the excitation energy, but also the excitation character itself is impacted by the presence of specific groups, and the pH-dependence of the spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Ensemble Variational Optimization Algorithm: Applications to Molecular Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing molecules with optimized properties remains a fundamental challenge due to the intricate relationship between molecular structure and properties. Traditional computational approaches that address the combinatorial number of possible molecular designs become unfeasible as the molecular size increases, suffering from the so-called `curse of dimensionality' problem. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware present new opportunities to address this problem. Here, we introduce the Quantum Ensemble Variational Optimization (QEVO) method for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. QEVO efficiently maps molecular structures onto an orthonormal basis of Pauli strings and samples from a superposition state generated by a variational ansatz. The ansatz is iteratively optimized to identify molecular candidates with the desired property. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the potential of QEVO in designing drug-like molecules with anticancer properties, employing a shallow quantum circuit that requires only a modest number of qubits. We envision that QEVO could be applied to a wide range of complex problems, offering practical solutions to problems with combinatorial complexity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic shielding in the atomic hydrogen anion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atomic hydrogen anion H$^-$ is the lightest stable anion and its bound states and resonances are well studied in the literature. Due to the planned comparison of the bare antiproton to H$^-$ in a Penning trap, we study the magnetic shielding of H$^-$ using the nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, by accurately calculating the non-relativistic shielding, as well as finite nuclear mass, relativistic, and partially QED corrections. We find that the finite nuclear mass correction is quite significant in H$^-$ contributing about $0.1\%$ of the total shielding, which is more than twice as much as the relativistic correction. Our final result for the shielding constant has a nine-parts-per-trillion accuracy and paves the way for direct comparison of the antiproton-to-proton magnetic moments.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computation of vibrational properties of molecules is a promising platform to obtain computational advantages for computational chemistry. However, fault-tolerant quantum computations of vibrational properties remain a relatively unexplored field in quantum computing. In this work, we present different algorithms for efficient encodings of vibrational Hamiltonians using qubitization. Specifically, we investigate different encoding representations, high order tensor decomposition to obtain low rank approximations for the vibrational Hamiltonian, rectilinear and polyspherical coordinate systems, parallelization and grouping algorithms. To investigate the performance of the different methods, we perform benchmark computations for both small and large molecules with more than one hundred vibrational modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15211v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical empirical force fields have dominated biomolecular simulation for over 50 years. Although widely used in drug discovery, crystal structure prediction, and biomolecular dynamics, they generally lack the accuracy and transferability required for first-principles predictive modeling. In this paper, we introduce MACE-OFF, a series of short range transferable force fields for organic molecules created using state-of-the-art machine learning technology and first-principles reference data computed with a high level of quantum mechanical theory. MACE-OFF demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of short range models by accurately predicting a wide variety of gas and condensed phase properties of molecular systems. It produces accurate, easy-to-converge dihedral torsion scans of unseen molecules, as well as reliable descriptions of molecular crystals and liquids, including quantum nuclear effects. We further demonstrate the capabilities of MACE-OFF by determining free energy surfaces in explicit solvent, as well as the folding dynamics of peptides.Finally, we simulate a fully solvated small protein, observing accurate secondary structure and vibrational spectrum. These developments enable first-principles simulations of molecular systems for the broader chemistry community at high accuracy and relatively low computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Super-capacitors interfaced with quantum dots at the electrolyte/electrode interface: capacitance gain and fluorescence line-width narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs), embedded in supercapacitors (S-C) cells exhibited capacitance amplification that peaked at certain QD concentration. More than 2.5 peak amplification was demonstrated with cyclic voltammetry (C-V) at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s. The mass ratio of the dots to that of the active-carbon electrode (A-C) was less than 1:5000. Fluorescence signals from dry (without electrolyte) and wet (with electrolyte) samples, exhibited a correlated, substantial peak enhancement vs QD concentration, as well. In the case of wet samples, fluorescence line narrowing was demonstrated, which indicates a substantial fluorescence gain. Both effects are attributed to local field effects through formation of a colloidal array at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Embedding QDs at the electrolyte/electrode interface has an added value that it may be further enhanced by white light and indeed this is the case here. Probing the electrolyte/electrode interface with fluorescing materials adds to our basic knowledge of the interface and could be useful for light-sensitive S-C cells.</description>

      <title>Simulating stochastic population dynamics: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an abundance of highly stochastic, non-linear phenomena present in population dynamics across various fields, including molecular biology, epidemiology, and ecology. Oscillations and multi-stability are particularly prevalent in gene regulation systems. None of the currently available stochastic models for population dynamics are accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, known as the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks such as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation, still, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models may achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they sacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability. This paper demonstrates that, with specific modifications, the LNA can indeed accurately capture non-linear dynamics in population dynamics. We introduce a new framework that employs centre manifold theory, a classical concept in non-linear dynamical systems. This approach allows us to identify simple, specialised modifications to the LNA tailored to classes of qualitatively similar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can achieve accurate long-term predictions without compromising its computational efficiency. We apply our methodology to a class of oscillatory systems and a class of bi-stable systems, and we provide multiple examples in molecular population dynamics that showcase accurate long-term predictions, and significant improvements in computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

Abstract: With four electrons, He$_2$ is one of very few molecules for which first-principles quantum-chemical calculations that include the treatment of nonadiabatic, relativistic and quantum-electrodynamics corrections are possible. Precise spectroscopic measurements are needed as references to test these calculations. We report here on a spectroscopic measurement of the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+\leftarrow a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+$ electronic transition of $^4$He$_2$ at a precision ($\Delta \nu/\nu$) of $2.5\times 10^{-10}$ and with full resolution of the rotational, spin-spin and spin-rotational fine structures. The investigation focuses on transitions to the rotational levels of the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ state, located energetically above the He$(1$ $^1S_0) + $He$(2$ $^3S_1)$ dissociation limit and decaying by tunneling predissociation through a barrier in the $c$ state. The new data include a full map of the energy levels of the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with rotational quantum numbers $N$ up to 9 and 10, respectively, and full sets of fine-structure intervals in these levels for comparison with first-principles calculations from a parallel investigation [B. R\'acsai, P. Jeszenszki, A. Marg\'ocsy and E. Maty\'us, arXiv:2506.23879v1 (2025)]. The new data were combined with data from earlier measurements of the spectrum of the $c-a$ band system of $^4$He$_2$ to derive full sets of molecular constants for the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with much improved precision over previous experimental results. A pronounced broadening of the linewidths of the transitions to the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4,N=10)$ fine-structure levels is attributed to tunneling predissociation through a barrier in the potential of the $c$ state and is quantitatively accounted for by calculations of the predissociation widths.</description>
