      <title>Assessing engineering wake models against operational data: insights from the Lillgrund wind farm wake steering campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validating engineering wake models under real-world operational conditions is essential for improving wind farm performance predictions. This study uses a unique dataset from the Lillgrund offshore wind farm collected during the Horizon 2020 TotalControl project, combining synchronous SCADA and LiDAR measurements under baseline operation (no intentional yaw offset) and active wake steering. Four analytical wake model combinations are assessed, employing different formulations for velocity deficit, added turbulence, wake superposition, and deflection, implemented in the LongSim software developed by DNV. The analysis focuses on time-averaged wake velocity deficits and turbine- and farm-level power output, with model accuracy quantified using mean absolute error metrics. The models reproduce general wake deficit trends and wake deflection across a range of atmospheric conditions, with normalised velocity deficit errors between 7% and 15%. Power prediction errors increase with farm depth, with turbine-level errors between 3% and 23% and farm-level errors between -13% and +30%. Some analytical models achieve accuracy comparable to reported LES results while requiring substantially lower computational cost. The results highlight the value of field campaigns for benchmarking engineering wake models and inform trade-offs between model fidelity and operational practicality for wake steering applications.</description>

      <title>Metal Halide Perovskites for Violet and Ultraviolet Light Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.</description>

      <title>Deeply nonlinear magnon-photon hybrid excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the microwave-power dependence of magnon-photon coupling in a yttrium iron garnet-sphere/split-ring-resonator hybrid system at room temperature and demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave interactions suppress the coupling through power-induced dissipation of magnetostatic modes. At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Macro-Scale Electrostatic Origami Motor</title>

Abstract: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.</description>

      <title>Photonic Links for Spin-Based Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing variety of optically accessible spin qubits have emerged in recent years as key components for quantum sensors, qubits, and quantum memories. However, the scalability of conventional spin-based quantum architectures remains limited by direct microwave delivery, which introduces thermal noise, electromagnetic cross-talk, and design constraints for cryogenic, high-field, and distributed systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for RF-over-fiber (RFoF) control of optically accessible spins through RFoF optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The RFoF platform relies on an electro-optically modulated telecom-band laser that transmits microwave signals over fiber and a high-speed photodiode that recovers the RF waveform to drive NV center spin transitions. We obtain an RFoF efficiency of 1.81\% at 2.90~GHz, corresponding to $P_{\mathrm{RF,out}}=-0.7$~dBm. The RFoF architecture provides a path toward low-noise, thermally isolated, and cryo-compatible ODMR systems bridging conventional spin-based quantum sensing protocols with emerging distributed quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Full-wave Inverse Design of Electromagnetic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse design enables automating the discovery and optimization of devices achieving performance significantly exceeding that of traditional human-engineered designs. However, existing methodologies to inverse-design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully-parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to milliseconds per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. This method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional electromagnetics solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 16,000x, shortening the design process from multiple days to weeks down to minutes. The approach enables practical and ultrafast design of complex structures that are prohibitively time-consuming for prior inverse design methods.</description>
