      <title>No Sign of a Magnetar Remnant Following the Kilonova-Producing Long GRB 211211A $\sim 1.7~$Years Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB), the merger of two neutron stars may produce a temporarily or indefinitely stable neutron star remnant with a strong magnetic field (a "magnetar"). As this magnetar remnant spins down, it can deposit its rotational energy into the surrounding kilonova ejecta, producing synchrotron emission that peaks in the radio bands $\sim$months-years after the merger ("boosted kilonova"). The nearby ($z=0.0763$) long-duration GRB 211211A, which has an apparent kilonova counterpart and likely neutron star merger progenitor, may have produced such a remnant. We observed the location of GRB 211211A at 6 GHz with the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) spanning $\approx 0.54$-$1.7~$years after the burst. We do not detect any radio emission, placing strong limits on the energy deposited into the ejecta by any remnant to $\lesssim 4.4 \times 10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. Due to the proximity of the event, we are also able to place limits on a kilonova afterglow that did not receive any additional energy deposition, though it is possible such emission will be suppressed until $\sim 4~{\rm years}$ after the burst, when the kilonova is expected to overtake the forward shock of the GRB. Future observations with the VLA and next-generation radio facilities will be able to further constrain the magnetar-boosted kilonova and kilonova afterglow scenarios, as well as directly constrain models in the scenario that GRB 211211A was instead produced by a collapsar.</description>

      <title>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients as "Failed" Gravitational Wave Sources: Helium Core$-$Black Hole Mergers Following Delayed Dynamical Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries in which a massive donor star undergoes an extended ($\gtrsim$ kyr) phase of stable mass transfer onto a black hole (BH) accretor offer a promising channel for creating LIGO gravitational wave sources. However, in many systems the mass transfer terminates prematurely in a dynamical instability at orbital periods of a few days, culminating in the BH plunging into the donor and potentially disrupting and accreting its helium core at highly super-Eddington rates. Combining a suite of binary evolution models with analytic estimates and population synthesis, we predict the population of luminous transients from delayed dynamical instability (DDI) and attribute them to the "luminous" class of fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The initial plunge of the BH into the partially stripped envelope typically ejects $\sim 10M_{\odot}$ of H/He-enriched material at speeds $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, generating a compact circumstellar medium (CSM) of radius $\lesssim 1000R_{\odot}$ by the time the BH meets and tidally disrupts the HeC. Rapid BH accretion generates a highly aspherical wind-driven explosion into the environment, powering UV/optical emission via CSM interaction and X-ray reprocessing that rises over a few days to a luminosity $\sim 10^{44}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ before fading as the disk spreads outwards and accretion rate drops. Luminous radio/sub-mm emission is generated over several months as the jet collides with the slow quasi-spherical binary outflow, generated by the stable mass transfer preceding DDI, extending to radii $\sim 10^{17}$ cm, in agreement with the inferred CSM environments of LFBOTs. We estimate local rates of DDI merger transients $5-300$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a preference for low-metallicities, in agreement with LFBOT demographics. Taken together, our results support LFBOTs as being luminous signposts of "failed" gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Power Spectra of Density Fluctuations in GRMHD Simulations of Black Hole Accretion Using Taylor's Frozen-in Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the spatial power spectrum of density fluctuations in magnetohydrodynamic flows in a suite of high-resolution, long-time-span general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Extracting the local spatial power spectrum in curved spacetime directly from GRMHD simulations can be challenging for several conceptual and mechanical reasons, including choices of the reference frame, the non-uniform co-ordinate grid of the outputs and limited resolution. Taylor's frozen-in hypothesis describes a mapping between the temporal and spatial power spectrum of turbulence, which we apply to density fluctuations. We explore the validity of the assumptions underlying Taylor's hypothesis and evaluate its applicability in extracting spatial power spectra of density fluctuations of black hole accretion flows. Using outputs from the GRMHD code KORAL, we explore models with strong and ordered magnetic fields (MAD, Magnetically Arrested Disks) as well as weak and disordered magnetic fields (SANE, Standard and Normal Evolution). We explore the effects of black hole spin on the power spectra and characterize their spectral properties as a function of distance from the black hole. The observed power spectra follow a broken power law with two slopes separated by a break frequency. Our analysis shows a decrease in break frequency with increasing radius, with distinct trends between SANE and MAD flows. We also observe the first slope to be steeper for SANE flows and some notable distinctions between prograde and retrograde spins.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectroscopy of SN Ia 2022aaiq and 2024gy: Evidence for Enhanced Central Stable Ni Abundance and a Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical + near-infrared (NIR) + mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the normal Type~Ia supernovae (SN Ia) 2022aaiq and 2024gy in the nebular phase, continuously spanning 0.35--28 microns. Medium-resolution JWST spectroscopy reveals novel narrow ($v_{\mathrm{FWHM}}&lt;1500$ km s$^{-1}$) [Ni II] 1.94 and 6.64 micron cores in both events. The MIR [Ni II] 6.64 micron line exhibits a distinct narrow core atop a broader base, indicating a central enhancement of stable Ni. This structure points to high central densities consistent with a near-Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{Ch}$) progenitor or a high-metallicity sub-$M_{Ch}$ progenitor. From detailed line-profile inversions of SN 2024gy, we derive emissivity profiles for stable iron-group elements (IGEs), radioactive material, and intermediate-mass elements (IMEs), revealing spatially distinct ejecta zones. The [Ni III] 7.35 micron line shows a shallow-to-steep slope transition - a "broken-slope" morphology - that matches predictions for delayed detonation explosions with separated deflagration and detonation ashes. We also reanalyze and compare to archival JWST spectra of SN 2021aefx and the subluminous SN 2022xkq. We estimate a stable $^{58}$Ni mass of $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$ for SN 2024gy, consistent with delayed detonation models, and $\sim0.01$ M$_\odot$ for SN 2022xkq, favoring sub-$M_{Ch}$ scenarios. These results demonstrate that resolved line profiles, now accessible with JWST, provide powerful diagnostics of explosion geometry, central density, and progenitor mass in SN Ia.</description>

      <title>Studying the properties of reconnection-driven turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection, often accompanied by turbulence interaction, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical environments. However, the current understanding of the nature of turbulent magnetic reconnection remains insufficient. We investigate the statistical properties of reconnection turbulence in the framework of the self-driven reconnection. Using the open-source software package AMUN, we first perform numerical simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection. We then obtain the statistical results of reconnection turbulence by traditional statistical methods such as the power spectrum and structure function. Our numerical results demonstrate: (1) the velocity spectrum of reconnection turbulence follows the classical Kolmogorov type of $E\propto k^{-5/3}$, while the magnetic field spectrum is steeper than the Kolmogorov spectrum, which are independent of limited resistivity, guide field, and isothermal or adiabatic fluid states; (2) most of the simulations show the anisotropy cascade, except that the presence of a guide field leads to an isotropic cascade; (3) reconnection turbulence is incompressible in the adiabatic state, with energy distribution dominated by the velocity solenoidal component; (4) different from pure magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the intermittency of the velocity field is stronger than that of the magnetic field in reconnection turbulence. The steep magnetic field spectrum, together with the velocity spectrum of Kolmogorov type, can characterize the feature of the reconnection turbulence. In the case of the presence of the guide field, the isotropy of the reconnection turbulence cascade is also different from the cascade mode of pure MHD turbulence. Our experimental results provide new insights into the properties of reconnection turbulence, which will contribute to advancing the self-driven reconnection theory.</description>

      <title>QPOs in a highly magnetized ultra-compact X-ray binary 4U 1626-67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of mHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in four NuSTAR observations of 4U 1626-67 during its recent spin-down episode. By using a novel method based on the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), we present the first QPO-phase-resolved timing and spectral analysis of accreting X-ray pulsars in low mass X-ray binaries. Broadband QPO waveforms have been reconstructed and exhibit approximately sinusoidal shapes, with fractional amplitudes that vary with energy. In addition, we find that spin pulse profiles exhibit stable shapes between different QPO phases with different instantaneous fluxes, while the fractional root-mean-square (rms) is distinct for different observations. In this source, both QPO-phase-resolved and averaged spectra can be modeled with a negative and positive powerlaws exponential (NPEX) model, and their spectral evolutions show a similar trend, suggesting that the QPO modulation is caused by accretion rate variability instead of a geometric obscuration. These results provide new constraints on accretion physics in strongly magnetized neutron stars and the underlying mechanisms of QPOs.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive X-ray Spectral-timing Analysis of GRS 1915+105 Based on Insight-HXMT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRS 1915+105 has been well studied since its discovery, and is well-known for its complex light curve variability. Using the full currently available Insight-HXMT dataset from July 2017 to June 2023, we make a comprehensive spectral-timing analysis of this source and report four main findings. First, we uncover a QPO frequency rising branch between MJD 58206 and 58230, where the centroid frequency increases from $\sim$2 Hz to $\sim$6 Hz, consistent with a spectral state transition from the hard to intermediate state. This rising branch completes the full QPO frequency evolution cycle when combined with the subsequent frequency decay phase, and had been missed in prior NICER and Insight-HXMT studies. Second, we identify a previously unreported Flare 3 during the obscured state, which shows distinct spectral and timing properties compared to the earlier flares. Third, we detect sub-Hz QPOs (&lt;1 Hz) in all three flares, specifically at $\sim$0.01 Hz in Flare 1 and $\sim$0.2 Hz in both Flares 2 and 3. In particular, the weak $\sim$0.2 Hz signals observed in Flare 3 indicate ongoing coronal activity despite strong obscuration. Finally, a comparison between QPOs above and below 1 Hz suggests distinct origins, with the former likely arising from Lense-Thirring precession of the inner hot flow and the latter from magnetic perturbations driving a failed disk wind. These findings offer new insights into the unique accretion geometry and variability behaviors of GRS 1915+105.</description>

      <title>Accretion onto Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly every galactic core contains a supermassive compact object, hypothesized to be a Kerr black hole. It was only with the advent of Event Horizon Telescope observations that the predictions of this hypothesis could be observationally tested for our own Galaxy, and the nearby elliptical M87, on spatial scales comparable to the gravitational radius. At the same time it became possible to test whether alternatives such as naked singularities in general relativity, or similar objects in alternative theories of gravity, are excluded by the data. These and other observational developments renewed interest in non-Kerr spacetime metrics, also in the context of active galactic nuclei at cosmological distances. Recently, we have shown that accreting naked singularities in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric of general relativity tend to produce strong outflows. The geometry and origin of these winds is studied here, and their parameter dependence is investigated. To this end we performed numerical GR hydrodynamical simulations of accretion of electrically neutral matter in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric and discussed the results in the context of analytic predictions of fluid motion in this spacetime.</description>

      <title>Possible Quasi-Period Oscillation Signals in the Unique Event of GRB 250702DBE/EP250702a?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 250702DBE was time-consequently triggered by GBM onboard the Fermi satellite. It is uncertain which celestial catalog is suitable for this special ultra-long event to belong to. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the lightcurves obtained by Fermi-GBM detectors. In the energy band of 8-1000 keV, no Quasi-Period Oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the lightcurve of the first burst 250702D, a possible QPO signal of 0.046 Hz corresponding to a period of 21.7 s is found in the lightcurve of the second burst 250702B, and a possible QPO signal of 0.024 Hz corresponding to a period of 41.7 s is found in the lightcurve of last burst 250702E. The significance level of the possible QPO signals is comprehensively examined. In addition, we examine the spectral properties of the sources. In general, a broken power law is suitable for modeling the spectral data from 8 keV to 40 MeV. We qualitatively suggest some kinds of celestial object with the periodic characteristic that might be the progenitors of this unique event.</description>

      <title>New Evidence for Extragalactic Einstein Probe Transients associated with Long Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) remains a fundamental open question in high-energy astrophysics. The Einstein Probe (EP) mission provides a transformative opportunity to investigate their nature. While mounting observations of EP-discovered EFXTs (EP-EFXTs) suggest a possible connection to long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs), an in-depth comparative analysis between them remains lacking. Here, we present a comparative analysis of their cosmic formation histories, revealing that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs share a similar evolutionary trend-showing a marked decline at $z&lt;1.0$ and a plateau beyond $1.0&lt;z&lt;5$-which clearly distinguishes them from short GRBs. This result is derived from a rigorously selected sample of EP-EFXTs, using Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to reconstruct, for the first time, the luminosity function and formation rate of EP-EFXTs without any assumptions. Our findings provide independent evidence that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs may originate from a common progenitor channel.</description>

      <title>Black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 shows Type-B quasi-periodic oscillations across the hard-intermediate and soft-intermediate states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a timing analysis of \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations of the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 across a bright soft X-ray flare on 2023 September 19 (MJD 60206). At the peak of the flare, the source undergoes a brief transition from the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) into the soft-intermediate state (SIMS), marked by the simultaneous appearance of three discrete radio jet ejections, a drop in broadband noise in the 2$-$10 keV band, and the presence of a narrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a characteristic ``U''-shaped phase-lag spectrum and a quality factor of $Q \geq 6$, features that robustly identify it as a Type-B QPO. The Type-C QPO, which was clearly detected in the HIMS prior to the flare, is not observed at the flare's peak and only reappears afterward. Most notably, we find that the Type-B QPO is not restricted to the SIMS: it is present throughout all our observations, including those taken in the HIMS, where it appears as a broad shoulder of the Type-C QPO. During the flare, the Type-B and Type-C QPOs exhibit distinct evolutionary trends in frequency, fractional rms amplitude, and phase lag. These results challenge the traditional view that Type-B QPOs are exclusive to the SIMS, a state that is, in fact, defined by their appearance in the power spectrum, and directly linked to discrete jet ejections. Instead, our findings suggest that the physical conditions giving rise to Type-B QPOs occur more broadly within the inner accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Thermal Deformations in Super-Eddington Magnetized Neutron Stars: Implications for Continuous Gravitational-Wave Detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating neutron stars (NSs) are promising targets for continuous gravitational-wave (CGW) searches with current and next-generation ground-based GW detectors. In this Letter, we present the first study of thermal deformations in super-Eddington magnetized NSs with column accretion, where magnetic fields induce anisotropic heat conduction that leads to crustal temperature asymmetries. We compute the resulting mass quadrupole moments and estimate the associated CGW strain amplitudes. Our results show that Galactic magnetized NSs undergoing super-Eddington column accretion can emit detectable CGWs in upcoming observatories. Assuming a 2-yr coherent integration, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer could detect such CGW signals from rapidly spinning NSs with spin periods $P \lesssim 20\,\rm ms$, while the LIGO O5 run may detect systems with $P \lesssim 6 \,{\rm ms}$. These findings suggest that super-Eddington magnetized NSs could represent a new class of CGW sources, providing a unique opportunity to probe the NS crust and bridge accretion physics with GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Characterizing IceTop Response to Low-Energy Air Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the response of the IceTop tanks to low-energy air showers in the GeV to TeV energy range based on simulated and measured count rates. Correlating this response with primary cosmic rays provides a tool to study Galactic and solar cosmic-ray flux modulations, particularly for solar particle events. We present long-term behavior of the IceTop scaler rates for a range of discriminator thresholds to better understand and calibrate the detector's response to changing environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Investigation for binary characteristics of LS I+61303 with optical polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optical linear polarization caused by Thomson scattering of the stellar radiation for gamma-ray binary \lsi61, which likely contains a young pulsar. Based on the pulsar binary scenario, we model the interaction between the pulsar wind and stellar wind from the massive companion star, which creates a shock. To accurately compute the resulting polarization of the stellar wind, we develop a method for the Thomson scattering that accounts for the finite size of the companion star. By fitting the optical polarization data, we constrain the system parameters, such as eccentricity, the momentum ratio of the two winds, and mass-loss rate from the companion star. We find that (i) the predicted eccentricity $e\sim 0.1$ is smaller than the values derived from the radial velocity curve and (ii) the orbital phase of the periastron is $\nu_{\rm p}=0.5-0.6$, which is consistent with the previous polarization study of Kravtsov et al. Additionally, we estimate the mass-loss rate from the companion star and the momentum ratio of two winds as $\dot{M}\sim 2\times 10^{-6}\rm M_{\odot}~{\rm year^{-1}}$ and $\eta&gt;0.1$, respectively. Assuming that the pulsar wind carries the spin-down energy, the spin-down magnetic field of the putative pulsar inferred from these parameters is of the order of $B\sim 10^{14}\mathrm{G}$, which may support the highly-B pulsar or magnetar scenario for the compact object of $\rm{LS\ I} +61^{\circ}303$. We also discuss the dispersion measure under the predicted orbital geometry and provide a corresponding interpretation of the pulsed radio signal detected by FAST.</description>

      <title>Coherence of Supermassive Black Hole Binary Demographics with the nHz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a refined estimation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) based on observed dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) together with AGN X-ray luminosity functions, in light of recent Pulsar Timing Array detections of an nHz SGWB. We identify a characteristic luminosity dependence in dual AGN fractions by compiling recent observational datasets, providing crucial constraints on supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) populations. Our AGN-based model reproduces the current SGWB measurements within PTA observational uncertainties of $2 - 4 \sigma$ uncertainties, demonstrating consistency between electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. These findings establish SMBHBs as the dominant source of the nHz gravitational wave signal, providing crucial insights into their demographics and evolution.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent X-ray Variability in Cygnus X-1: A 12-Year NuSTAR Timing Study of Accretion Flow Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 using 26 NuSTAR observations spanning 2012-2024, providing the most detailed characterization to date of its accretion flow variability across spectral states. Our analysis reveals fundamental insights into the physics governing state transitions in stellar-mass black holes. We discover distinct bimodal flux distributions in the 8-79 keV band with well-separated peaks, contrasting with overlapping distributions in the 3-8 keV band. This energy-dependent bimodality establishes hard X-rays as the optimal diagnostic for state classification, directly tracing the geometric transformation between corona-dominated and disk-dominated configurations. Power spectral analysis uncovers state-dependent characteristic frequencies shifting from 0.050 Hz (hard) to 0.074 Hz (intermediate), with featureless red noise in soft states. These frequencies correspond to disk truncation radii evolving from $\sim$5.5 $R_g$ to $\sim$2 $R_g$, providing direct observational evidence for the inward progression of the accretion disk during state transitions. Frequency-dependent time lags evolve systematically from $\sim$50 ms hard lags at 0.1 Hz in hard states to near-zero in soft states, quantifying the collapse of the Comptonizing corona. Linear rms-flux relations persist across all states with parameters that precisely track the relative contributions of thermal versus non-thermal emission components. Most remarkably, we identify a failed state transition (observation 30302019006) exhibiting anticorrelated band behavior, suppressed variability ($F_{var}$ &lt; 1.38\%), and apparent sub-ISCO truncation. This discovery challenges standard transition models and suggests new pathways for accretion flow evolution in wind-fed systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant W and Z Boson Production in FSRQ Jets: Implications for Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs.We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Gamma-Ray Bursts' Prompt Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I report on the discovery of 34 new quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the prompt light curves of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from the Swift/BAT catalog: with one or more constant leading periods, as well as several chirping signals. This is the largest homogenously identified sample or GRB QPOs to date. The presence of QPOs suggests the existence of characteristic time scales that at least in some GRBs might be related to the dynamical properties of plasma trajectories in the accretion disks powering the relativistic jets. Several scenarios for their origin were examined. We identify non-planar orbits around Kerr black holes, the Lense-Thirring effect, and shock oscillations as plausible mechanisms for the QPO generation.</description>

      <title>Second Discovery of GeV-TeV Connection from the Globular Cluster UKS 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 16 years of data collected by Fermi Large Area Telescope and 1523 days of survey data from High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, we discovered the long-sought second GeV-TeV connection towards the globular cluster (GC) UKS 1 (Shin et al. 2025). Gamma-ray spectroscopy suggests that the GeV emission can be attributed to both the pulsar magnetosphere and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) by the pulsar wind. In particular, the TeV peak is displaced from the cluster center by several tidal radii in the trailing direction of the proper motion of UKS 1. This alignment supports a scenario in which relativistic leptons, likely driven by a millisecond pulsar population, produce very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays via ICS within a bow shock tail. Our findings not only highlights GCs as potential sources of VHE gamma-rays, but also offers a rare opportunity to probe cosmic ray transport in the Milky Way by studying particle propagation and anisotropic gamma-ray production associated with the extended, offset TeV feature of UKS 1.</description>

      <title>Survival of the accretion disk in LMC Recurrent Nova 1968-12a: UV--X-ray case study of the 2024 eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on UV and X-ray observations of the 2024 eruption of the recurrent nova LMCN 1968-12a, a rapidly recurring extragalactic system with a $\sim$4.3 year recurrence period and a massive white dwarf (WD). The eruption was discovered on 2024 August 1.8 by \textit{Swift}, and subsequently monitored using \textit{AstroSat}'s UVIT and SXT, along with Swift/UVOT and XRT. The multi-wavelength light curves reveal a rapid UV-optical decline, followed by a plateau phase exhibiting 1.26-day modulations consistent with the orbital period. The Supersoft (SSS) X-ray emission, that emerged by day 5, exhibited a double peak, suggesting variable obscuration that could be due to an inhomogeneous nova ejecta or due to a nova super-remnant along the line of sight. Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy shows a blackbody component with T $\approx 10^6$ K. The SEDs obtained concurrently in the UV, peaking at T $\approx$ 20,000 K and with a source radius $\sim$2-3 R$_\odot$, are inconsistent with emission from the secondary star or nova photosphere alone. Instead, the UV emission is attributed to an irradiated accretion disk that survived the eruption. The persistent UV plateau and its temperature suggest that the accretion disk was not completely disrupted and resumed activity within days, consistent with recent findings in other rapidly recurring novae such as U~Sco and M31N~2008-12a.</description>

      <title>Revisiting FRB 20121102A: milliarcsecond localisation and a decreasing dispersion measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FRB 20121102A is the original repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source and also the first to be localised to milliarcsecond precision using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). It has been active for over 13 years and resides in an extreme magneto-ionic environment in a dwarf host galaxy at a distance of ~1 Gpc. In this work, we use the European VLBI Network (EVN) to (re-)localise FRB 20121102A and its associated persistent radio source (PRS). We confirm that the two are co-located -- improving on previous results by a factor of ~4 and constraining the FRB and PRS co-location to ~12 pc transverse offset. Over a decade, the PRS luminosity on milliarcsecond scales remains consistent with measurements on larger angular scales, showing that the PRS is still compact. We also present the detection of 18 bursts with the Nancay Radio Telescope (NRT) as part of our \'ECLAT monitoring program. These bursts, together with previously published results, show that the observed dispersion measure (DM) of FRB 20121102A has dropped by ~25 pc/cc in the past five years, highlighting a fractional decrease in the local DM contribution of &gt;15%. We discuss potential physical scenarios and highlight possible future observations that will help reveal the nature of FRB 20121102A, which is one of only a few known FRBs with a luminous PRS.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Observables of Weakly Collisional Black Hole Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black holes in the Event Horizon Telescope sources Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) are embedded in a hot, collisionless plasma that is fully described in kinetic theory yet is usually modeled as an ideal, magnetized fluid. In this Letter, we present results from a new set of weakly collisional fluid simulations in which leading order kinetic effects are modeled as viscosity and heat conduction. Consistent with earlier, lower-resolution studies, we find that overall flow dynamics remain very similar between ideal and non-ideal models. For the first time, we synthesize images and spectra of SgrA* from weakly collisional models -- assuming an isotropic, thermal population of electrons -- and find that these remain largely indistinguishable from ideal fluid predictions. However, most weakly collisional models exhibit lower light curve variability, with all magnetically dominated models showing a small but systematic decrease in variability.</description>

      <title>Unveil A Peculiar Light Curve Pattern of Magnetar Burst with GECAM observations of SGR J1935+2154</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetar X-ray Burst (MXB) is usually composed of a single pulse or multiple pulses with rapid rise and brief duration mostly observed in hard X-ray (soft gamma-ray) band. Previous work studied the temporal behavior of some magnetar bursts and employed the Fast Rise Exponential Decay (FRED) model to fit pulses of MXB. However, whether there is other kind of pulse shape has not been explored. In this study, we systematically examined light curve of MXBs from SGR J1935+2154 detected by GECAM between 2021 and 2022. We find that there are different light curve morphologies. Especially, we discover a peculiar and new pattern, Exponential Rise and Cut-Off Decay (ERCOD), which is significantly different from FRED and could be well described by a mathematical function we proposed. We find that MXBs with ERCOD shape are generally longer in duration, brighter in the peak flux, and harder in spectrum. We note that the ERCOD shape is not unique to SGR J1935+2154 but also present in other magnetars. This new light curve pattern may imply a special burst and radiation mechanism of magnetar.</description>

      <title>Probing spectral variability in NGC 4490 ULX-8 over 24 years of XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift-XRT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive spectral and timing results of 14 Chandra, 6 XMM-Newton and 19 Swift-XRT observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 4490 ULX-8, spanning from 2000 to 2024. We model the source spectra using absorbed power-law and absorbed multicolour disc blackbody models. The best-fit photon indices span 0.92-2.68, with typical uncertainties ranging from $\pm$0.1 to $\pm$1 depending on data quality. The inner disk temperature range from 0.97 to 1.69 keV, consistent with blackbody emission from an accretion disk. Our results reveal significant long-term variability in intrinsic X-ray source fluxes while the source remains relatively stable within individual observations. A Hardness-Intensity Diagram of the source shows no clear transition between hard and soft states, but an increase in brightness during two recent observations taken on 2022 December 1 and 2024 May 4. We find a positive correlation of X-ray luminosity and photon index that persists even when the hydrogen column density is tied across observations, suggesting a physical origin. The X-ray luminosity-inner disk temperature relation yields a weakly constrained slope owing to large temperature uncertainties, but a simpler fixed-slope test indicates consistency with a standard thin-disk. Using the derived disk parameters, we estimate the black hole mass to lie in the range of 16-75 $M_{\odot}$, under the assumption of a geometrically thin accretion flow, where the lower and upper bounds correspond to a Schwarzchild and a Kerr black hole respectively. Alternatively, we consider the scenario of ULX-8 hosting an accreting neutron star and estimate the corresponding magnetic field strength required to explain the observed properties.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the {\nu}i process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Orbital Modulation in Spider Pulsars: Three Discoveries and a Universal Modulated Fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binary millisecond pulsars (also known as spiders) allow us to probe pulsar winds in their innermost regions, between the light cylinder (radius $\sim10^{7}$ cm) and the companion star (at $\sim10^{11}$ cm). Their flux is known to vary along the orbit, from radio to X-rays. During the past decade, gamma-ray orbital modulation (GOM) has been discovered in a handful of spiders, but its origin remains largely unknown. We present the results of a systematic search for GOM among 43 systems, selecting pulsed 0.1-1 GeV photons and using spin and orbital ephemeris from Fermi's Third Pulsar Catalog. We discover GOM from three spiders - PSR J1124-3653, PSR J1946-5403 and PSR J2215+5135 - and confirm four previous detections. In all seven cases so far, the GOM peaks near the pulsar's superior conjunction. The X-ray orbital light curves are usually in anti-phase, peaking when the pulsar is at inferior conjunction, but we find one case where both gamma-rays and X-rays peak around superior conjunction: PSR J1946-5403. We measure the modulated fractions of the GOM and find consistent values for all seven spiders, with an average $22.0\pm2.6\%$. Including eclipsing systems seen edge-on, we find no clear dependence of the modulated fraction on the orbital inclination (within $\simeq$45-90$^\circ$). Our results challenge previous models proposed to explain GOM in spiders, based on inverse Compton and synchrotron emission close to the companion, since these predict a clear dependence with orbital inclination (stronger modulation at high inclinations). We nearly double the number of GOM detections in spiders, showing that it is more common than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Time-Dilation Methods for Extreme Multiscale Timestepping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical simulations involve extreme dynamic range of timescales around 'special points' in the domain (e.g. black holes, stars, planets, disks, galaxies, shocks, mixing interfaces), where processes on small scales couple strongly to those on large scales. Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and hybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial, physics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following the long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical timestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating simulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling this in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then projected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming in and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is modulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch factor $a({\bf x},\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches (including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and ensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and derive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to ensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different physics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes it possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear scale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is flexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and limitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these methods and physical time dilation in GRMHD. We demonstrate how this can be used to obtain effective speedup factors exceeding $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ in multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>GATOS IX: A Detailed Assessment and Treatment of Emission Line Contamination in JWST/MIRI Images of Nearby Seyfert Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband mid-infrared (MIR) imaging with high spatial resolution is useful to study extended dust structures in the circumnuclear regions of nearby AGN. However, broadband imaging filters cannot distinguish dust continuum emission from emission lines, and so accounting for the emission line contamination becomes crucial in studying extended dust in these environments.This paper uses Cycle 1 MIR imaging from JWST/MIRI and spectroscopy from JWST/MRS for 11 local Seyfert galaxies, as part of the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Three of the objects (NGC 3081, NGC 5728, and NGC 7172) exist in both datasets, allowing direct measurement of the line emission using the spectroscopy for these objects. We find that extended MIR emission persists on scales of 100s of parsecs after the removal of contamination from emission lines. Further, the line contamination levels vary greatly between objects (from 5% to 30% in the F1000W filter), and across filters, so cannot be generalised across a sample and must be carefully treated for each object and band. We also test methods to estimate the line contamination when only MRS spectroscopy or MIRI imaging is available, using pre-JWST ancillary data. We find that these methods estimate the contamination within 10 percentage points. This paper serves as a useful guide for methods to quantify and mitigate for emission line contamination in MIRI broadband imaging</description>

      <title>An FPCA-Enhanced Ensemble Learning Framework for Photometric Identification of Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are essential tools for addressing key cosmic questions, including the Hubble tension and the nature of dark energy. Modern surveys are predominantly photometry-based, making the construction of a clean photometric SNe Ia sample crucial. In this study, we investigate whether functional principal component analysis (FPCA) scores derived from photometric light curves, combined with ensemble learning, can reliably distinguish SNe Ia from other transients using the PLAsTiCC dataset. FPCA provides a data-driven, flexible characterization of light curves without relying on rigid theoretical model assumptions. Light curves are fitted by minimizing residuals with penalty terms from clean samples, making the method robust to outliers or poorly sampled bands. The first two FPCA scores and peak magnitudes across the five LSST bands are used as classification features. We implement two complementary binary classifiers: an ensemble boosting model (CatBoost) and a statistical probabilistic method based on Euclidean distances. CatBoost slightly outperforms the statistical method, achieving 98.5% accuracy and 97.8% precision. Performance remains robust (&gt;90%) under typical photometric redshift uncertainties ({\sigma} = 0.1). On the spectroscopic DES Y5 sample, both methods reach approximately 90% accuracy and 95% precision, demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods with limited cross-survey applicability. Applied to DECam DDF and DESIRT transients, the predictions strongly agree, and their intersection provides a high-confidence SNe Ia sample for cosmological analyses. Overall, this FPCA-based framework offers a powerful, flexible tool for classifying transients in upcoming large-scale surveys such as LSST and Roman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. - Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical applications.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of Nuclear Star Clusters and Massive Black Holes: Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in the co-evolution of massive black holes (MBHs) and nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which host diverse stellar populations across a wide range of masses. The dynamics are simulated self-consistently with GNC, which we have updated to incorporate gravitational wave orbital decay, the loss cone of a spinning MBH, and stellar evolution. Over $12$ Gyr, we investigate the evolution of the NSC with a mass-growing MBH, as well as the EMRIs of stellar black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs (BDs), and low-mass main-sequence stars (MSs), along with tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving MSs, BDs, and post-MSs. The mass growth of the MBH contributed by TDEs is typically $\sim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$, $\sim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$, and $\sim 5\times10^4\,M_{\odot}$ for massive, Milky-Way-like, and smaller NSCs, respectively. Between $40\%$ and $70\%$ of the stellar mass is lost during stellar evolution, which dominates the mass growth of the MBH if a significant fraction of the lost mass is accreted. The evolution of EMRI rates is generally affected by the cluster's size expansion or contraction, stellar population evolution, MBH mass growth, and the stellar initial mass function. The EMRI rates for compact objects peak at early epochs ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) and then gradually decline over cosmic time. LISA-band ($0.1$ mHz) EMRIs involving compact objects around Milky-Way-like MBHs tend to have high eccentricities, while those around spinning MBHs preferentially occupy low-inclination (prograde) orbits. In contrast, MS- and BD-EMRIs usually have eccentricity and inclination distributions that are distinct from those of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing and resampling: a guide to utilising posterior samples from gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories have opened new scientific research in astrophysics, fundamental physics, and cosmology. The collaborations that build and operate these observatories release the interferometric strain data as well as a catalogue of observed signals with accompanying Bayesian posterior distributions. These posteriors, in the form of equally-weighted samples, form a dataset that is used by a multitude of further analyses seeking to constrain the population of merging black holes, identify lensed pairs of signals, and much more. However, many of these analyses rely, often implicitly, on the ability to reconstruct the likelihood and prior from the inputs to the analysis and apply resampling (a statistical technique to generate new samples varying the underlying analysis assumptions). In this work, we first provide a guide on how to reconstruct and modify the posterior density accurately from the inputs for analyses performed with the Bilby inference library. We then demonstrate and compare resampling techniques to produce new posterior sample sets and discuss Pareto-smoothing to improve the efficiency. Finally, we provide examples of how to use resampling to study observed gravitational-wave signals. We hope this guide provides a useful resource for those wishing to use open data products from the LVK for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Hints of Dark Matter Spikes in Low-mass X-ray Binaries: a critical assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Milky Way show rates of period decay which cannot be easily explained by standard mechanisms. Recently, it has been claimed that the anomalous period decays in two of these systems may be explained by dynamical friction due to very high dark matter (DM) densities around the black holes. We critically assess these claims by performing $N$-body simulations of binaries embedded in dense DM ``spikes". We simulate the previously-studied systems XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00, as well as studying the third binary Nova Muscae 1991 for the first time in this context. These simulations show that feedback on the DM distribution plays a crucial role and we rule out previously-claimed shallow DM spikes. We set lower limits on the steepness $\gamma$ of DM density profiles required to explain the period decay in these LMXBs, requiring $\gamma \gtrsim 2.15-2.20$ in XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00 and $\gamma \gtrsim 2.3$ in Nova Muscae 1991. Improved modeling of the long-term evolution of binaries embedded in DM spikes may allow us to exclude even larger densities in future.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the limits on dark matter annihilation cross-section and decay lifetime in light of electron and positron fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the upper bound on the annihilation cross-section, $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ of a stable dark matter (DM) of mass $5\times10^2-10^{14}$ GeV by considering five different channels: $W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $e^+e^-$. We use the observed electron and positron fluxes from CALET, DAMPE, HESS, positron flux from AMS-02, and gamma-ray flux from HAWC, GRAPES-3, CASA-MIA to constrain the annihilation cross-section. We also consider unstable DM of mass $10^3-10^{16}$~GeV decaying to $W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $e^+e^-$ and derive the corresponding lower bound on the DM lifetime, $\tau_{\rm DM}$. We find that the latest data from CALET gives a stringent constraint on $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ in the low DM mass regime. For a typical DM mass of 1 TeV, we show that $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{{\rm DM~DM}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-24})~\rm cm^3/s$ is disfavored. On the other hand in the low mass regime, the AMS-02 gives a much stringent limit on the DM lifetime, excluding $\tau_{\rm DM\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-}\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{27})$ s for a 1 TeV mass of DM. In the high mass regime, typically $M_{\rm DM}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ GeV, HAWC and CASA-MIA give the strongest constraints on $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ and $\tau_{\rm DM}$.</description>

      <title>Kilonova emission from GW230529 and mass gap neutron star-black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of the gravitational wave event GW230529, presumably a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger, by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration marks an exciting discovery for multimessenger astronomy. The black hole (BH) has a high probability of falling within the "mass gap" (mg) between the neutron star (NS) and the BH mass distributions. Because of the relatively low primary mass, this system has a higher likelihood of producing an electromagnetic counterpart than previously detected NSBH mergers. We analyze the potential kilonova (KN) emission from GW230529 and find that, if the source was an NSBH merger, there is a $\sim $2-$28\%$ probability (depending on the assumed equation of state) that it produced a KN peaking at $\sim 1$ day post-merger with $g \lesssim 23.5$ and $i &lt; 23$. Hence, it could have been detected by ground-based telescopes. If instead the event was a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, the probability of KN production drops to $\sim $0-$10\%$. Motivated by these results, we simulate a broader population of mgNSBH mergers expected during the fifth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O5) and find a $2$-$3\%$ chance of KN production per event. Such KNe would typically be fainter than GW230529, with $g \lesssim 26$ and $i \lesssim 25$. Based on these findings, DECam-like instruments may be able to detect up to $\sim 70\%$ of future mgNSBH KNe, corresponding to $1-2$ multimessenger mgNSBH per year in O5.</description>

      <title>Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13673v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new kilonovae. We simulate GW events assuming a data-driven distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the kilonova optical light curves. We use the simulated population of kilonovae to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of kilonova detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates. We expect to detect BNS (NSBH) kilonovae with DECam at a per-year rate of: $0$-$2.0$ ($0$) in O4, and $2.0$-$19$ ($0$-$1.0$) in O5. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable kilonova to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH. We release GW simulations and depths required to detect kilonovae based on our predictions to support the astronomical community in their multimessenger follow-up campaigns and analyses.</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Solution for GSN 069 Disk Evolution and the Nature of Long-Lived Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully \textit{time-dependent} relativistic disk model-based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD-into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We use it fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, from 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs-of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can naturally be explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, like ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their distinction lies in the `viscous' timescale parameter-tied to the disk's angular momentum transport efficiency-which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We argue that existing QPE models may not be able to reproduce the observed connection between the presence (2018) or absence (2014) of eruptions and the disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a challenge for QPE models.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the Estimation of Air Shower Observables from Monte Carlo Simulation of Radio Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of extensive air showers (EAS) induced by cosmic rays via radio signals has undergone significant advancements in the last two decades. Numerous ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments routinely capture radio pulses in the MHz to GHz frequency range emitted by EAS. The Monte Carlo simulation of these radio pulses is crucial to enable an accurate reconstruction of the primary cosmic ray energy and to infer the composition of the primary particles. In this work, a comprehensive comparison of the predicted electric field in EAS simulated with CoREAS and ZHAireS was conducted to estimate the systematic uncertainties arising from the use of different simulation packages in the determination of two key shower observables namely, the electromagnetic energy of the EAS and the depth of maximum development ($X_{\rm max}$). For this comparison, input parameters and settings as similar as possible were used in both simulations, along with the same realistic atmospheric refractive index depending on altitude, which is crucial for the prediction of radio emission properties of EAS. In addition, simulated EAS with very similar values of depth of maximum development were selected. Good agreement was found between CoREAS and ZHAireS, with discrepancies in the dominant electric field components generally remaining below 10\% across the frequency range of a few MHz to hundreds of MHz, relevant for most radio detection experiments, translating into uncertainties in the determination of energy below $5\%$ and $\simeq 10\,\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ in $X_{\rm max}$. Our work underscores the need for further studies to clarify their origin and impact on $X_{\rm max}$ inference in composition analyses.</description>

      <title>The Phase Space of Low-Mass Binary Compact Objects from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Catalog: Hints on the Chances of Different Formation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging. The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\lesssim 5 M_\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron star, astrophysical black hole, or primordial black hole. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.</description>

      <title>The Cygnus X-1 Puzzle: Implications of X-ray Polarization Measurements in the Soft and Hard States on the Properties of the Accretion Flow and the Emission Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we summarize key observational constraints of the accretion flow on the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1). The discussion highlights the flows of energy close to the black hole and the importance of the distance range from which the radiating zone draws its energy. For the hard state, we examine compact and extended corona models. We find that compact corona models are energetically favored, but extended models cannot be fully excluded. We discuss the high linear polarization of the Cyg X-1 X-rays in the soft and hard states, parallel to the direction of the radio jet. We propose the presence of a pair layer enveloping the accretion disk moving at approximately half the speed of light away from the disk for both the soft and the hard state. In the soft state, the pairs cool to the Compton temperature of the disk emission. In the hard state, the pairs acquire thermal and bulk motion allowing them to Comptonize the emission to produce the observed power law emission. In both emission states, the bulk motion away from the disk leads to a net polarization parallel to the radio jet. We emphasize that the geometry of the accretion flow in the hard state is still not well constrained, and that observed spectral (including the relativistically broadened Fe K-$\alpha$ line) and spectro-polarimetric signatures depend strongly on the plasma processes responsible for energy dissipation in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>A binary model of long period radio transients and white dwarf pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) represent a recently uncovered class of Galactic radio sources exhibiting minute-to-hour periodicities and highly polarised pulses of second-to-minute duration. Their phenomenology does not fit exactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars or white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with confirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as WD -- M dwarf binaries. Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii and J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in hrs-tight orbits, with polarised radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind.
  Here, we investigate the longest-lived LPT known, GPM J1839-10, demonstrating that it has a ~8.75 hr orbital period. We show that its radio pulses can be modelled in the same geometric framework as WD binary pulsars, in which radio emission is triggered when the magnetic axis of a rotating WD intersects its companion's wind in the binary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital period and binary geometry from radio data alone. The model naturally predicts its intermittent emission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period between the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and polarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying it to the WD pulsar J1912-44, it successfully reproduces the emission profile and geometry as well. Our results suggest analogous emission-site geometries in these related classes of binary system -- a possibility we extend to the broader LPT / WD pulsar population.</description>

      <title>A Late-time Radio Search for Highly Off-axis Jets from PTF Broad-lined Ic Supernovae in GRB-like Host Galaxy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen/Helium-poor stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae with broad lines (SNe Ic-bl) almost always accompany the nearby ($z &lt; 0.3$) jetted relativistic explosions known as long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the majority of SNe Ic-bl have no detected GRB counterpart. At least some of these SNe should harbor off-axis jets, whose afterglow may become detectable at late times, particularly at radio wavelengths. Here, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations (rest frame times of $\sim 3$-$4\times10^{3}$ days post SN discovery) of a sample of 14 SNe Ic-bl discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) that have been demonstrated to originate from the same host environments as the SNe Ic-bl associated with nearby GRBs. Of the 14 SNe, we identify three that are radio detected, one of which (PTF10tqv, $z = 0.0795$) is consistent with an off-axis jet with energy similar to classical GRBs (${\sim 10^{51}}$-${10^{51.7}~}$erg). Using recently developed synchrotron radiation code, we find that for our 11 non-detections, which are among the deepest limits obtained for Ic-bl, we rule out an off-axis jet with an energy of $\gtrsim 10^{51}~{\rm erg}$ in circumburst densities of $\gtrsim 10^{-1}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We predict that well-spaced monitoring of newly discovered SNe Ic-bl from $\sim 10~$days to $\sim 10~$years (rest frame) to luminosities of $\sim 10^{27}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}~{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ will constrain the existence of highly off-axis jets ($\gtrsim60^\circ$) with classical GRB energies. The VLA Sky Survey will probe jets that are $\lesssim 60^\circ$ off-axis, whereas the Deep Synpotic Array 2000 will probe jets out to $\sim 90^\circ$ off-axis, demonstrating the importance of utilizing radio surveys to supplement targeted observations.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Maximum Variability to Discern TDE Emission from AGN Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray emission arising from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may potentially mimic the expected emission of tidal disruption events (TDEs). Ongoing and upcoming wide-field X-ray surveys will detect thousands of TDE-like sources, and classifying them securely as TDEs or AGNs is a challenging task. To this aim, we measure the average X-ray variability of AGNs and derive a threshold of maximum variation as a function of time separating the TDEs from AGN flares. For the comparison between TDE and AGN X-ray variability, we cross-match the publicly available XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT point source catalogs with the Million Quasars Catalog and optically selected TDEs. Then we compute the X-ray structure function (SF) and maximum variability of the AGN and TDE samples. The X-ray SF of AGNs has a power-law index $\gamma\sim0.11-0.14$ when fitted with a simple power-law model. However, the SF of AGNs is best described by a broken power-law or a power exponential model with a damping time scale $\tau=950\pm300$ days. The maximum variability comparison between TDE and simulated AGN light curves indicates they have a similar order of variation on a time scale of less than 20 days. However, at a longer time scale of $\sim20$ days or more, the large-scale variations expected from power-law-like decay in TDEs become less frequent in AGNs. Furthermore, we compare the maximum variability of eROSITA TDE candidates with AGN, finding that many of the eROSITA-DE TDE candidates are consistent with flares from AGNs, and may not be TDEs.</description>

      <title>Prospects for dark matter observations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) orbiting the Milky Way are widely regarded as systems supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravity, and as prime targets for the search for indirect dark matter (DM) signatures in the GeV-to-TeV $\gamma$-ray range owing to their lack of astrophysical $\gamma$-ray background. We present forecasts of the sensitivity of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to annihilating or decaying DM signals in these targets. An original selection of candidates is performed from the current catalogue of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint dSphs. For each, the expected DM content is derived using the most comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic data available, within a consistent framework of analysis. This approach enables the derivation of novel astrophysical factor profiles for indirect DM searches, which are compared with results from the literature. From an initial sample of 64 dSphs, eight promising targets are identified -- Draco I, Coma Berenices, Ursa Major II, Ursa Minor and Willman 1 in the North, Reticulum II, Sculptor and Sagittarius II in the South -- for which different DM density models yield consistent expectations, leading to robust predictions. CTAO is expected to provide the strongest limits above $\sim$10 TeV, reaching velocity-averaged annihilation cross sections of $\sim$5$\times$10$^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and decay lifetimes up to $\sim$10$^{26}$ s for combined limits. The dominant uncertainties arise from the imprecise determination of the DM content, particularly for ultra-faint dSphs. Observation strategies are proposed that optimise either deep exposures of the best candidates or diversified target selections.</description>

      <title>The orbital period and inclination of the neutron star X-ray transient MAXI J1807+132</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutron star X-ray transient MAXI J1807+132 has undergone outbursts in 2017, 2019, and 2023. We conducted an $R$-band time series photometry campaign using the Isaac Newton Telescope during the 2022 quiescent state. We detected a periodic variation in the light curve, consistent with ellipsoidal modulation, which allowed us to determine an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} = 4.258 \pm 0.008$ hr. By modelling the light curve, we obtained a binary inclination of $ i = 72\pm5 \, \deg $ and a mass ratio $q = 0.24^{+0.19}_{-0.14}$ ($68$ per cent confidence level). Furthermore, our analysis supports an early M-dwarf companion that contributes between 30 and 50 per cent to the total flux in the $R$-band. We extend the previously established absolute magnitude versus orbital period correlation for black hole X-ray transients to neutron star systems. We applied the correlation to MAXI J1807+132, estimating its distance as $6.3 \pm 0.7$ kpc and its height above the Galactic plane to be $1.6 \pm 0.2$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Impact of dineutrons on nuclear compositions of a core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nuclear compositions in the central region of a core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons ($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100~ms after core bounce, ${}^2n$ and ${}^4n$ are more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 and 50~km, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of ${}^2n$ and ${}^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100~km reduces, while the mass fractions of protons, deuterons, and $\rm{{}^4He}$ increase. Due to the uncertainties in the properties of $^2n$ and $^4n$, we investigate the influence of their binding energies on the nuclear composition. We find the binding energy of $^2n$ has only a modest effect on the overall composition, except for its own mass fraction, while that of $^4n$ has a negligible impact.</description>

      <title>Binary mass transfer in 3D: Mass Transfer Rate and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors for the adiabatic case. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</description>

      <title>An Accurate Modeling of Nano-hertz Gravitational Wave Signal from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes: An Essential Step Toward a Robust Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), provides a promising probe of the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These binaries are expected to retain significant eccentricity throughout their evolution. We present a new technique to model the nHz SGWB by incorporating eccentricity into a multi-scale adaptive simulation framework. Using the time-domain eccentric waveform model ESIGMAHM, we generate realistic GW signals from astrophysical populations of SMBHBs. Unlike circular binaries, eccentric systems emit across multiple frequencies, introducing spectral correlations between frequency bins. These correlations provide a novel observational signature of the eccentricity distribution of the SMBHB population. In this work, we adopt simplified power-law models for the eccentricity distribution. While this does not capture the full complexity of galactic environments, it effectively highlights the key features of GW emission from eccentric binaries and their imprint on the SGWB. Our approach advances nHz GW signal modeling by incorporating eccentricity at small scales, enabling more realistic predictions and offering a new avenue for probing SMBHB astrophysics with future PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the impact of the solar modulation on AMS-02 antiproton excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of solar modulation on the antiproton excess observed by AMS-02, which may indicate dark matter (DM) annihilation. We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable. This work highlights the need for refined solar modulation models and a better treatment of uncertainties for a conclusive interpretation of the AMS-02 data.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations of Event Time Series with Sparse Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection, Similarity Search, and Unsupervised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation of Neutron Star Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) from astrophysical observations of masses, radii and tidal deformabilities, using Neural posterior estimation (NPE) with Conditional Normalising Flows (CNF). To ensure that the model conforms with reality, physics-informed constraints are embedded directly into the training loss. This enables efficient, likelihood-free inference of full posterior distributions for key thermodynamic quantities-including pressure, squared speed of sound, and the trace anomaly-conditioned on observational data. Our models are trained on synthetic datasets generated from two agnostic EoS priors: polytropic parametrizations (PT) and gaussian process (GP) reconstructions. These datasets span various scenarios, including the presence or absence of tidal deformability information and observational noise. Across all settings, the method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors, with uncertainties reduced when tidal deformability constraints are included. Furthermore, we find that the behavior of normalized predictive dispersions is strongly correlated with the maximum central density inside NSs, suggesting that the model can indirectly infer this physically meaningful quantity. The approach generalizes well across EoS families and accurately reconstructs derivative quantities such as the polytropic index, demonstrating its robustness and potential for probing dense matter in NS cores.</description>

      <title>Entering the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow realm in Symbiotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a suite of dynamical simulations designed to explore the orbital and accretion properties of compact (2$-$7 AU) symbiotic systems, focusing on wind accretion, drag forces, and tidal interactions. Using three levels of physical complexity, we model systems of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with masses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M$_\odot$ orbiting evolving Solar-like stars with 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. We show that systems alternate between standard wind accretion and Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLO) regimes during periods of high mass-loss rate experienced by the donor star (the peak of red giant phase and/or thermal pulses). For some configurations, the standard wind accretion has mass accretion efficiencies similar to those obtained by WRLO regime. Tidal forces play a key role in compact systems, leading to orbital shrinkage and enhanced accretion efficiency. We find that systems with high-mass WDs ($\geq 1$ M$_\odot$) and massive donors (2$-$3 M$_\odot$) are the only ones to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Interestingly, the majority of our simulations reach the Roche lobe overflow condition that is not further simulated given the need of more complex hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis shows that increasing physical realism, by including drag and tides, systematically leads to more compact final orbital configurations. Comparison with compact known symbiotic systems seems to suggest that they are very likely experiencing orbital decay produced by tidal forces.</description>
