      <title>Planet Mass Function around M stars at 1-10 au: A Plethora of sub-Earth mass objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small planets ($\lesssim 1$ M$_\oplus$) at intermediate orbital distances ($\sim$1 au) represent an uncharted territory in exoplanetary science. The upcoming microlensing survey by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be sensitive to objects as light as Ganymede and unveil the small planet population at $1-10$ au. Instrumental sensitivity to such planets is low and the number of objects we will discover is strongly dependent on the underlying planet mass function. In this work, we provide a physically motivated planet mass function by combining the efficiency of planet formation by pebble accretion with the observed disk mass function. Because the disk mass function for M dwarfs ($0.4-0.6 \, M_\odot$) is bottom heavy, the initial planet mass function is also expected to be bottom-heavy, skewing towards Ganymede and Mars mass objects, more so for heavier initial planetary seeds. We follow the subsequent dynamical evolution of planetary systems over $\sim$100 Myr varying the initial eccentricity and orbital spacing. For initial planet separations of $\geq$3 local disk scale heights, we find that Ganymede and Mars mass planets do not grow significantly by mergers. However, Earth-like planets undergo vigorous merging and turn into super-Earths, potentially creating a gap in the planet mass function at $\sim 1$ M$_{\oplus}$. Our results demonstrate that the slope of the mass function and the location of the potential gap in the mass function can probe the initial architecture of multi-planet systems. We close by discussing implications on the expected difference between bound and free-floating planet mass functions.</description>

      <title>ExoLyn: a golden mean approach to multi-species cloud modelling in atmospheric retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Clouds are ubiquitous in exoplanets' atmospheres and play an important role in setting the opacity and chemical inventory of the atmosphere. Understanding clouds is a critical step in interpreting exoplanets' spectroscopic data. Aims. The aim is to model the multi-species nature of clouds in atmospheric retrieval studies. To this end, we develop ExoLyn - a 1D cloud model that balances physical consistency with computational efficiency. Methods. ExoLyn solves the transport equation of cloud particles and vapor under cloud condensation rates that are self-consistently calculated from thermodynamics. ExoLyn is a standalone, open source package capable to be combined with \texttt{optool} to calculate solid opacities and with \texttt{petitRADTRANS} to generate transmission or emission spectra. Results. With ExoLyn we find that the compositional structure of clouds in hot Jupiter planets' atmospheres is layered with a cloud dominated by magnesium-silicates on top of an iron cloud. This finding is consistent with more complex cloud formation models but can be obtained with ExoLyn in only a few seconds. The composition of the cloud particles can be constrained from the spectrum, for example, MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4 components give rise to an absorption feature at 8 - 10 um. We investigate the dependence of the cloud structure on the bulk elemental composition of the planet and find that SiO2-dominated clouds forms on metal-rich planet and Fe clouds with strong extinction effect forms on C-rich planet. Conclusions. Designed towards maximum flexibility, ExoLyn can also be used in retrieval analysis of sub-Neptunes and self-luminous planets. The efficiency of ExoLyn opens the possibility of joint retrieval of exoplanets' gas and cloud components.</description>

      <title>3D Modeling of Moist Convective Inhibition in Hydrogen-Dominated Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many planets have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, including sub-Neptune exoplanets, recently formed planets with primordial atmospheres, and the Solar System's giant planets. Atmospheric convection behaves differently in hydrogen-rich atmospheres compared to higher mean molecular weight atmospheres due to compositional gradients of tracers. Previous 1D studies suggested that compositional gradients of condensing tracers in hydrogen-rich atmospheres can entirely shut-off convection when the tracer abundance exceeds a critical threshold, leading to the formation of radiative layers where the temperature decreases faster with height than in convective profiles. We use 3D convection-resolving simulations to determine if convection is inhibited in hydrogen-rich atmospheres when the tracer mixing ratio exceeds the critical threshold. Three simulation sets are performed with a water vapor tracer in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. First, we perform simulations initialized on saturated isothermal states and find that compositional gradients can destabilize isothermal states, leading to rapid convective mixing. Next, simulations initialized on adiabatic profiles show distinct, stable inhibition layers form when the water vapor tracer exceeds the critical threshold defined by previous studies. Within the inhibition layers, a small amount of energy is transported through condensation and re-evaporation, contrary to previous findings. The thermal profile slowly relaxes to a steep radiative state, but radiative relaxation timescales are long. Lastly, we show that superadiabatic temperature profiles can remain stable when the tracer abundance is greater than the critical amount. Our results suggest stable layers driven by condensation-induced convective inhibition form in hydrogen-rich atmospheres, including those of sub-Neptune exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Size-Based Spectrophotometric Analysis of the Polana-Eulalia Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polana-Eulalia Complex (PEC) is an Inner Main Belt, C-complex asteroid population that may be the source of the near-Earth asteroid spacecraft mission targets (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu. Here, we report a size-based investigation of the visible (VIS; 0.47 -- 0.89 um) spectrophotometric slopes of the PEC's constituent families, the New Polana and Eulalia Families. Using two releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Moving Object Catalog as well as the 3rd data release of the Gaia catalog, we present evidence of size-based slope variability within each family. We find that Eulalia family members exhibit lower average slopes than Polana family members in all catalogs' samples, particularly for objects &lt; 9 km in diameter. We are unable to conclude that VIS slope distinguishability between the families is statistically significant, but we explore a potential cause of the bulk slope differences between the PEC families, in addition to providing commentary on size-slope trends generally.</description>

      <title>uGMRT Survey of EXoplanets Around M-dwarfs (GS-EXAM): Radio observations of GJ 1151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent radio emission with properties similar to planetary auroral signals has been reported from GJ 1151, a quiescent, slow-rotating mid-M star, by the LOFAR Two-metre (120-170 MHz) Sky Survey (LoTSS). The observed {LOFAR} emission is fairly bright at 0.89 mJy with 64% circular polarization, and the emission characteristics are consistent with the interaction between an Earth-sized planet with an orbital period of 1-5 days and the magnetic field of the host star. However, no short-period planet has been detected around GJ 1151. To confirm the reported radio emission caused by the putative planet around GJ 1151 and to investigate the nature of this emission, we carried out uGMRT observations of GJ 1151 at 150, 218, and 400 MHz over 33 hours across ten epochs. No emission was detected at any frequency. While at 150 MHz and 218 MHz, non-detection could be due to the low sensitivity of our observations, at 400 MHz, the rms sensitivities achieved were sufficient to detect the emission observed with LOFAR at $\sim$ 20$\sigma$ level. Our findings suggest that the radio emission is highly time-variable, likely influenced by the star-planet system's phase and the host star's magnetic field. Additional observations below 170 MHz, at more frequent epochs (as the periodicity of the emission is unknown), especially during periods of high stellar magnetic field strength, are needed to confirm the emission.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial planet formation during giant planet formation and giant planet migration I: The first 5 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial planet formation (TPF) is a difficult problem that has vexed researchers for decades. Numerical models are only partially successful at reproducing the orbital architecture of the inner planets, but have generally not considered the effect of the growth of the giant planets. I dynamically model TPF as the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn are growing using GENGA. The evolution of the masses, radii and orbital elements of the gas giants are precomputed and read and interpolated within GENGA. The terrestrial planets are formed by planetesimal accretion from tens of thousands of self-gravitating planetesimals spread between 0.5 au and 8.5 au. The total mass of the inner planetesimal disc and outer disc are typically 2 and 3 Earth masses respectively, and the composition of the planetesimals changes from non-carbonaceous-like to carbonaceous-like at a prescribed distance, ranging from 2 au to 5 au. After 5 Myr of evolution approximately 10% to 25% of the mass of planetesimals in the Jupiter-Saturn region is implanted in the inner solar system, which is more than what cosmochemical models predict. The implantation initially sets up a composition gradient in the inner solar system, with the fraction of outer solar system material increasing with increasing distance to the Sun. The planetesimals that remain in the inner solar system have a mixed composition. The growth of the gas giants scatters planetesimals in their vicinity into the inner solar system, which changes the isotopic composition of the terrestrial planets. The planetesimal disc in the vicinity of the gas giants may not have been very massive, ~1 ME. The inner planetesimal disc may not have extended much farther than 2 au otherwise embryos do not grow fast enough to produce Mars analogues. This could mean that the region of the current asteroid belt never contained much mass to begin with.</description>

      <title>Giant planets population around B stars from the first part of the BEAST survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets form from circumstellar protoplanetary discs whose fundamental properties (notably their extent, composition, mass, temperature and lifetime) depend on the host star properties, such as their mass and luminosity. B-stars are among the most massive stars and their protoplanetary discs test extreme conditions for exoplanet formation. This paper investigates the frequency of giant planet companions around young B-stars (median age of 16 Myr) in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, the closest association containing a large population of B-stars. We systematically search for massive exoplanets with the high-contrast direct imaging instrument SPHERE using the data from the BEAST survey, that targets an homogeneous sample of young B-stars from the wide Sco-Cen association. We derive accurate detection limits in case of non-detections. We found evidence in previous papers for two substellar companions around 42 stars. The masses of these companions are straddling the ~13 Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit but their mass ratio with respect to their host star is close to that of Jupiter. We derive a frequency of such massive planetary mass companions around B stars of 11-5+7%, accounting for the survey sensitivity. The discoveries of substellar companions bcen b and mu2sco B happened after only few stars in the survey had been observed, raising the possibility that massive Jovian planets might be common around B-stars. However our statistical analysis show that the occurrence rate of such planets is similar around B-stars and around solar-type stars of similar age, while B-star companions exhibit low mass ratios and larger semi-major axis.</description>

      <title>The erosion of large primary atmospheres typically leaves behind substantial secondary atmospheres on temperate rocky planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet exploration has revealed that many$\unicode{x2013}$perhaps most$\unicode{x2013}$terrestrial exoplanets formed with substantial H$_2$-rich envelopes, seemingly in contrast to solar system terrestrials, for which there is scant evidence of long-lived primary atmospheres. It is not known how a long-lived primary atmosphere might affect the subsequent habitability prospects of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we present a new, self-consistent evolutionary model of the transition from primary to secondary atmospheres. The model incorporates all Fe-C-O-H-bearing species and simulates magma ocean solidification, radiative-convective climate, thermal escape, and mantle redox evolution. For our illustrative example TRAPPIST-1, our model strongly favors atmosphere retention for the habitable zone planet TRAPPIST-1e. In contrast, the same model predicts a comparatively thin atmosphere for the Venus-analog TRAPPIST-1b, which would be vulnerable to complete erosion via non-thermal escape and is consistent with JWST observations. More broadly, we conclude that the erosion of primary atmospheres typically does not preclude surface habitability, and frequently results in large surface water inventories due to the reduction of FeO by H$_2$.</description>

      <title>An Eccentric Binary with a Misaligned Circumbinary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of Bernhard-2, which was previously identified as a candidate system to host a misaligned circumbinary disk. Our spectroscopic measurements confirm that Bernhard-2 indeed contains an eccentric ($e=0.69 \pm 0.08$) binary and thus that the periodic variability in the photometric light curve is best explained by the occultation by the misaligned circumbinary disk. By modeling the spectral energy distributions at different phases, we infer the system age to be $\sim 20\,$Myr and the masses of the two binary components to be $\sim 1.1\,M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot$, respectively. Our new photometric observations show clear deviations from the model prediction based on the archival data, suggesting ongoing precession of the circumbinary disk. The H$\alpha$ line of Bernhard-2 also shows an inverse P-Cygni profile at epochs close to the pericenter passage, which could be attributed to the pulsed accretion around the pericenter. Bernhard-2 therefore closely resembles the well studied KH 15D system. Further detailed observations and studies of such rare systems can provide useful information about disk physics and evolution.</description>

      <title>DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS): III. Understanding the DTARPS Candidate Transiting Planet Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS) project, using novel statistical methods, has identified several hundred candidates for transiting planetary systems obtained from 0.9 million Full Frame Image light curves obtained in the TESS Year 1 southern hemisphere survey (Melton et al. 2024a and 2024b). Several lines of evidence, including limited reconnaissance spectroscopy, indicate that at least half are true planets rather than False Positives. Here various population properties of these objects are examined. Half of the DTARPS candidates are hot Neptunes, populating the 'Neptune desert' found in Kepler planet samples. The DTARPS samples also identify dozens of Ultra Short Period planets with orbital periods down to 5 hours, high priority systems for atmospheric transimssion spectroscopy, and planets orbiting low-mass M stars. DTARPS methodology is sufficiently well-characterized at each step that preliminary planet occurrence rates can be estimated. Except for the increase in hot Neptunes, DTARPS planet occurrence rates are consistent with Kepler rates. Overall, DTARPS provides one of the largest and most reliable catalog of TESS exoplanet candidates that can be tapped to improve our understanding of various exoplanetary populations and astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Updated Ultraviolet Fluorescence Efficiencies of CS: Evidence for Model Discrepancies in the Enhancement of NUV-Derived CS Abundances in Comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of carbon monosulfide (CS) have a long history serving as a remote proxy for atomic sulfur, and more broadly, one of the sulfur reservoirs in cometary bodies. Recently, systematic discrepancies between NUV- and radio-derived CS abundances have been found to exceed a factor of 2 - 5, with NUV-derived abundances appearing enhanced for a wide array of comets. Interpretation of cometary CS emission in the ultraviolet has relied on a murky and ill-documented lineage of calculations whose accuracy can be difficult to assess. We report new fluorescence efficiencies of the CS radical, utilizing a rovibrational structure with vibrational states up to v = 8 and rotational states up to N = 100. The models utilize a new set of band transition rates derived from laboratory electron impact experiments. Benchmark comparisons to IUE observations of C/1979 Y1 (Bradfield) show favorable agreement with the fluorescence models. The present results affirm the accuracy of the historical record of CS abundances derived via ultraviolet CS emission in comets with IUE and HST, but do not explain the consistent enhancement of NUV-derived CS abundances relative to the radio measurements during the same apparitions. Alternative explanations of the factor of 2 - 5 discrepancy between NUV- and radio-derived CS abundances are discussed, as well as possible connections to sulfur reservoirs in protoplanetary disks. The model code and computed fluorescence efficiencies are made publicly available on the Zenodo service.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in the GG Tau A Disk: Constraints from H2D+, N2H+, and DCO+ High Angular Resolution ALMA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire their chemical compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of 1e-18 s-1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.</description>

Abstract: Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($&gt;3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. I. Introducing the GaiaPMEX tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia mission is expected to yield the detection of several thousands of exoplanets, perhaps at least doubling the number of known exoplanets. Although the harvest is expected to occur when the astrometric time series will be published with DR4 at the eve of 2026, the DR3 is already a precious database to search for exoplanet beyond 1 au. With this objective, we characterized multiple systems by exploiting two astrometric signatures derived from the DR3 astrometric solution of bright sources (G&lt;16). We have the proper motion anomaly, or PMa, for sources also observed with Hipparcos, and the excess of residuals in the RUWE and the astrometric excess noise (AEN). Those astrometric signatures give an accurate measurement of the astrometric motion of a source seen with Gaia, even in the presence of calibration and measurement noises. We found that they can allow identifying stellar binaries and hint to companions with a mass in the planetary domain. We introduce a tool called GaiaPMEX, that is able, for a given source, to model its astrometric signatures, by a photocenter orbit due to a companion with certain mass and semi-major axis (sma). Comparing to their actual measurements from the DR3 and Hipparcos, GaiaPMEX calculates a confidence map of the possible companion's mass and sma. The constraints on mass are, as expected, degenerate, but when allowed, coupling the use of PMa and RUWE, may significantly narrow the space of solutions. Thanks to combining Gaia and Hipparcos, planets are expected to be most frequently found within 1-10 au from their star, at the scale of Earth-to-Saturn orbits. In this range, exoplanets with mass down to 0.1 MJup are more favorably detected around M-dwarfs closer than 10 pc. Some fraction, if not all, of companions identified with GaiaPMEX may be characterized in the future using the astrometric time series that will be published with the DR4.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. II. A catalog of 9,698 planet candidate solar-type hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16993</link>

Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced a new tool called GaiaPMEX. It characterizes the mass and semi-major axis relative to the central star (sma) of a possible companion around any source observed with Gaia. It uses the value of RUWE, or, with both Gaia and Hipparcos, the value of proper motion anomaly (PMa), alone or combined with the RUWE. Our goal is to exploit the large volume of sources in Gaia's DR3 and find new exoplanet candidates. We wish to create a new input catalog of planet-candidate hosting systems to the disposal of future follow-up projects. Beyond G=14, this catalog would prepare the arrival of powerful instruments on the ELTs, that could include RV follow-up of faint stars and direct imaging of planets around main sequence Gyr-old stars. We used the mass-sma degenerate set of solutions obtained by GaiaPMEX from any value of RUWE to select a sample of bright (G&lt;16) Gaia sources whose companions could be planetary, with a mass &lt;13.5 MJup. It led us to identify a sample of 9,698 planet candidate hosting sources, whose companion may have a mass &lt;13.5 MJup in the range of 1-3-au sma. We identified 19 systems that are also reported in the Nasa exoplanet archive. We detected 8 substellar companions with a 1-3-au sma, initially discovered and characterised with RV and astrometry. Moreover, we found 6 transiting-planet systems and 2 wide-orbit systems for whom we predict the existence of supplementary companions. Focusing on the subsample of sources observed with Hipparcos, combining RUWE and PMa, we confirmed the identification of 4 new planetary candidate systems HD 187129, HD 81697, CD-42 883, and HD 105330. Given the degeneracy of mass-sma, many of the candidates in this 9,698 sources catalog might have a larger mass, in the brown-dwarf and stellar domain, if their sma departs from the 1-3-au range. The vetting of this large catalog will be the subject of future studies.</description>
