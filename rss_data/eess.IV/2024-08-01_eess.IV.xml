      <title>Domain Shift Analysis in Chest Radiographs Classification in a Veterans Healthcare Administration Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: This study aims to assess the impact of domain shift on chest X-ray classification accuracy and to analyze the influence of ground truth label quality and demographic factors such as age group, sex, and study year. Materials and Methods: We used a DenseNet121 model pretrained MIMIC-CXR dataset for deep learning-based multilabel classification using ground truth labels from radiology reports extracted using the CheXpert and CheXbert Labeler. We compared the performance of the 14 chest X-ray labels on the MIMIC-CXR and Veterans Healthcare Administration chest X-ray dataset (VA-CXR). The VA-CXR dataset comprises over 259k chest X-ray images spanning between the years 2010 and 2022. Results: The validation of ground truth and the assessment of multi-label classification performance across various NLP extraction tools revealed that the VA-CXR dataset exhibited lower disagreement rates than the MIMIC-CXR datasets. Additionally, there were notable differences in AUC scores between models utilizing CheXpert and CheXbert. When evaluating multi-label classification performance across different datasets, minimal domain shift was observed in unseen datasets, except for the label "Enlarged Cardiomediastinum." The study year's subgroup analyses exhibited the most significant variations in multi-label classification model performance. These findings underscore the importance of considering domain shifts in chest X-ray classification tasks, particularly concerning study years. Conclusion: Our study reveals the significant impact of domain shift and demographic factors on chest X-ray classification, emphasizing the need for improved transfer learning and equitable model development. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing medical imaging and enhancing patient care.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Aware Replay for Continual MRI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image distributions shift constantly due to changes in patient population and discrepancies in image acquisition. These distribution changes result in performance deterioration; deterioration that continual learning aims to alleviate. However, only adaptation with data rehearsal strategies yields practically desirable performance for medical image segmentation. Such rehearsal violates patient privacy and, as most continual learning approaches, overlooks unexpected changes from out-of-distribution instances. To transcend both of these challenges, we introduce a distribution-aware replay strategy that mitigates forgetting through auto-encoding of features, while simultaneously leveraging the learned distribution of features to detect model failure. We provide empirical corroboration on hippocampus and prostate MRI segmentation.</description>

      <title>Outlier Detection in Large Radiological Datasets using UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms heavily relies on the quality of samples and the accuracy of their corresponding labels. However, building and maintaining large, high-quality datasets is an enormous task. This is especially true for biomedical data and for meta-sets that are compiled from smaller ones, as variations in image quality, labeling, reports, and archiving can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and repeated samples. Here, we show that the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm can find these anomalies essentially by forming independent clusters that are distinct from the main (good) data but similar to other points with the same error type. As a representative example, we apply UMAP to discover outliers in the publicly available ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, and MURA datasets. While the results are archival and retrospective and focus on radiological images, the graph-based methods work for any data type and will prove equally beneficial for curation at the time of dataset creation.</description>

      <title>STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Guided Prompt Learning for Lifespan Brain MR Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic and accurate segmentation of brain MR images throughout the human lifespan into tissue and structure is crucial for understanding brain development and diagnosing diseases. However, challenges arise from the intricate variations in brain appearance due to rapid early brain development, aging, and disorders, compounded by the limited availability of manually-labeled datasets. In response, we present a two-step segmentation framework employing Knowledge-Guided Prompt Learning (KGPL) for brain MRI. Specifically, we first pre-train segmentation models on large-scale datasets with sub-optimal labels, followed by the incorporation of knowledge-driven embeddings learned from image-text alignment into the models. The introduction of knowledge-wise prompts captures semantic relationships between anatomical variability and biological processes, enabling models to learn structural feature embeddings across diverse age groups. Experimental findings demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed method, particularly noticeable when employing Swin UNETR as the backbone. Our approach achieves average DSC values of 95.17% and 94.19% for brain tissue and structure segmentation, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/TL9792/KGPL.</description>

      <title>MIST: A Simple and Scalable End-To-End 3D Medical Imaging Segmentation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation is a highly active area of research, with deep learning-based methods achieving state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks. However, the lack of standardized tools for training, testing, and evaluating new methods makes the comparison of methods difficult. To address this, we introduce the Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), a simple, modular, and end-to-end medical imaging segmentation framework designed to facilitate consistent training, testing, and evaluation of deep learning-based medical imaging segmentation methods. MIST standardizes data analysis, preprocessing, and evaluation pipelines, accommodating multiple architectures and loss functions. This standardization ensures reproducible and fair comparisons across different methods. We detail MIST's data format requirements, pipelines, and auxiliary features and demonstrate its efficacy using the BraTS Adult Glioma Post-Treatment Challenge dataset. Our results highlight MIST's ability to produce accurate segmentation masks and its scalability across multiple GPUs, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for future medical imaging research and development.</description>

      <title>Identity-Consistent Diffusion Network for Grading Knee Osteoarthritis Progression in Radiographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), a common form of arthritis that causes physical disability, has become increasingly prevalent in society. Employing computer-aided techniques to automatically assess the severity and progression of KOA can greatly benefit KOA treatment and disease management. Particularly, the advancement of X-ray technology in KOA demonstrates its potential for this purpose. Yet, existing X-ray prognosis research generally yields a singular progression severity grade, overlooking the potential visual changes for understanding and explaining the progression outcome. Therefore, in this study, a novel generative model is proposed, namely Identity-Consistent Radiographic Diffusion Network (IC-RDN), for multifaceted KOA prognosis encompassing a predicted future knee X-ray scan conditioned on the baseline scan. Specifically, an identity prior module for the diffusion and a downstream generation-guided progression prediction module are introduced. Compared to conventional image-to-image generative models, identity priors regularize and guide the diffusion to focus more on the clinical nuances of the prognosis based on a contrastive learning strategy. The progression prediction module utilizes both forecasted and baseline knee scans, and a more comprehensive formulation of KOA severity progression grading is expected. Extensive experiments on a widely used public dataset, OAI, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Force Sensing Guided Artery-Vein Segmentation via Sequential Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of arteries and veins in ultrasound images is crucial for vascular examinations and interventions in robotics-assisted surgeries. However, current methods for ultrasound vessel segmentation face challenges in distinguishing between arteries and veins due to their morphological similarities. To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel force sensing guided segmentation approach to enhance artery-vein segmentation accuracy by leveraging their distinct deformability. Our proposed method utilizes force magnitude to identify key frames with the most significant vascular deformation in a sequence of ultrasound images. These key frames are then integrated with the current frame through attention mechanisms, with weights assigned in accordance with force magnitude. Our proposed force sensing guided framework can be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation networks and achieves significant performance improvements in multiple U-shaped networks such as U-Net, Swin-unet and Transunet. Furthermore, we contribute the first multimodal ultrasound artery-vein segmentation dataset, Mus-V, which encompasses both force and image data simultaneously. The dataset comprises 3114 ultrasound images of carotid and femoral vessels extracted from 105 videos, with corresponding force data recorded by the force sensor mounted on the US probe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>HINER: Neural Representation for Hyperspectral Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces {HINER}, a novel neural representation for compressing HSI and ensuring high-quality downstream tasks on compressed HSI. HINER fully exploits inter-spectral correlations by explicitly encoding of spectral wavelengths and achieves a compact representation of the input HSI sample through joint optimization with a learnable decoder. By additionally incorporating the Content Angle Mapper with the L1 loss, we can supervise the global and local information within each spectral band, thereby enhancing the overall reconstruction quality. For downstream classification on compressed HSI, we theoretically demonstrate the task accuracy is not only related to the classification loss but also to the reconstruction fidelity through a first-order expansion of the accuracy degradation, and accordingly adapt the reconstruction by introducing Adaptive Spectral Weighting. Owing to the monotonic mapping of HINER between wavelengths and spectral bands, we propose Implicit Spectral Interpolation for data augmentation by adding random variables to input wavelengths during classification model training. Experimental results on various HSI datasets demonstrate the superior compression performance of our HINER compared to the existing learned methods and also the traditional codecs. Our model is lightweight and computationally efficient, which maintains high accuracy for downstream classification task even on decoded HSIs at high compression ratios. Our materials will be released at https://github.com/Eric-qi/HINER.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Controllable Motion Curve Guided Cardiac Ultrasound Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echocardiography video is a primary modality for diagnosing heart diseases, but the limited data poses challenges for both clinical teaching and machine learning training. Recently, video generative models have emerged as a promising strategy to alleviate this issue. However, previous methods often relied on holistic conditions during generation, hindering the flexible movement control over specific cardiac structures. In this context, we propose an explainable and controllable method for echocardiography video generation, taking an initial frame and a motion curve as guidance. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we extract motion information from each heart substructure to construct motion curves, enabling the diffusion model to synthesize customized echocardiography videos by modifying these curves. Second, we propose the structure-to-motion alignment module, which can map semantic features onto motion curves across cardiac structures. Third, The position-aware attention mechanism is designed to enhance video consistency utilizing Gaussian masks with structural position information. Extensive experiments on three echocardiography datasets show that our method outperforms others regarding fidelity and consistency. The full code will be released at https://github.com/mlmi-2024-72/ECM.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Medical Decathlon dataset: segmentation of colon and colorectal cancer from computed tomography images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer is the third-most common cancer in the Western Hemisphere. The segmentation of colorectal and colorectal cancer by computed tomography is an urgent problem in medicine. Indeed, a system capable of solving this problem will enable the detection of colorectal cancer at early stages of the disease, facilitate the search for pathology by the radiologist, and significantly accelerate the process of diagnosing the disease. However, scientific publications on medical image processing mostly use closed, non-public data. This paper presents an extension of the Medical Decathlon dataset with colorectal markups in order to improve the quality of segmentation algorithms. An experienced radiologist validated the data, categorized it into subsets by quality, and published it in the public domain. Based on the obtained results, we trained neural network models of the UNet architecture with 5-part cross-validation and achieved a Dice metric quality of $0.6988 \pm 0.3$. The published markups will improve the quality of colorectal cancer detection and simplify the radiologist's job for study description.</description>

      <title>Robust Simultaneous Multislice MRI Reconstruction Using Deep Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to the complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. This study presents a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method using deep generative priors. Starting from Gaussian noise, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to gradually recover the individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while imposing data consistency from the measured k-space under readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without special adjustments for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method integrates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address a practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods and generalizes well to unseen datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER after the review process.</description>

      <title>MSA2Net: Multi-scale Adaptive Attention-guided Network for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation involves identifying and separating object instances in a medical image to delineate various tissues and structures, a task complicated by the significant variations in size, shape, and density of these features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have traditionally been used for this task but have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformers, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, aim to address this problem. However, in medical image segmentation it is beneficial to merge both local and global features to effectively integrate feature maps across various scales, capturing both detailed features and broader semantic elements for dealing with variations in structures. In this paper, we introduce MSA2Net, a new deep segmentation framework featuring an expedient design of skip-connections. These connections facilitate feature fusion by dynamically weighting and combining coarse-grained encoder features with fine-grained decoder feature maps. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Scale Adaptive Spatial Attention Gate (MASAG), which dynamically adjusts the receptive field (Local and Global contextual information) to ensure that spatially relevant features are selectively highlighted while minimizing background distractions. Extensive evaluations involving dermatology, and radiological datasets demonstrate that our MSA2Net outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) works or matches their performance. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/xmindflow/MSA-2Net.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning for Fetal Cardiac Planes Classification using Ultrasound Scan Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are popular since they can address situations with limited annotated data by directly utilising the underlying data distribution. However, the adoption of such methods is not explored enough in ultrasound (US) imaging, especially for fetal assessment. We investigate the potential of dual-encoder SSL in utilizing unlabelled US video data to improve the performance of challenging downstream Standard Fetal Cardiac Planes (SFCP) classification using limited labelled 2D US images. We study 7 SSL approaches based on reconstruction, contrastive loss, distillation, and information theory and evaluate them extensively on a large private US dataset. Our observations and findings are consolidated from more than 500 downstream training experiments under different settings. Our primary observation shows that for SSL training, the variance of the dataset is more crucial than its size because it allows the model to learn generalisable representations, which improve the performance of downstream tasks. Overall, the BarlowTwins method shows robust performance, irrespective of the training settings and data variations, when used as an initialisation for downstream tasks. Notably, full fine-tuning with 1% of labelled data outperforms ImageNet initialisation by 12% in F1-score and outperforms other SSL initialisations by at least 4% in F1-score, thus making it a promising candidate for transfer learning from US video to image data.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Digital Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing for Precision Medicine and Molecular Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise quantification of nucleic acids is pivotal in molecular biology, underscored by the rising prominence of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in diagnosing infectious diseases and conducting genomic studies. This review examines recent advancements in digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) and digital Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (dLAMP), which surpass the limitations of traditional NAAT by offering absolute quantification and enhanced sensitivity. In this review, we summarize the compelling advancements of dNNAT in addressing pressing public health issues, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we explore the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing dNAAT image analysis, which not only improves efficiency and accuracy but also addresses traditional constraints related to cost, complexity, and data interpretation. In encompassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) development and potential of both software and hardware, the all-encompassing Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) systems cast new light on benefits including higher throughput, label-free detection, and expanded multiplex analyses. While acknowledging the enhancement of AI-enhanced dNAAT technology, this review aims to both fill critical gaps in the existing technologies through comparative assessments and offer a balanced perspective on the current trajectory, including attendant challenges and future directions. Leveraging AI, next-generation dPCR and dLAMP technologies promises integration into clinical practice, improving personalized medicine, real-time epidemic surveillance, and global diagnostic accessibility.</description>

      <title>FSSC: Federated Learning of Transformer Neural Networks for Semantic Image Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of image semantic communication in a multi-user deployment scenario and propose a federated learning (FL) strategy for a Swin Transformer-based semantic communication system (FSSC). Firstly, we demonstrate that the adoption of a Swin Transformer for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) effectively extracts semantic information in the communication system. Next, the FL framework is introduced to collaboratively learn a global model by aggregating local model parameters, rather than directly sharing clients' data. This approach enhances user privacy protection and reduces the workload on the server or mobile edge. Simulation evaluations indicate that our method outperforms the typical JSCC algorithm and traditional separate-based communication algorithms. Particularly after integrating local semantics, the global aggregation model has further increased the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by more than 2dB, thoroughly proving the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Federated Learning-Friendly Approach for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of SAM in 3D Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting foundation models for medical image analysis requires finetuning them on a considerable amount of data because of extreme distribution shifts between natural (source) data used for pretraining and medical (target) data. However, collecting task-specific medical data for such finetuning at a central location raises many privacy concerns. Although Federated learning (FL) provides an effective means for training on private decentralized data, communication costs in federating large foundation models can quickly become a significant bottleneck, impacting the solution's scalability. In this work, we address this problem of efficient communication while ensuring effective learning in FL by combining the strengths of Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) with FL. Specifically, we study plug-and-play Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) in a federated manner to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for 3D medical image segmentation. Unlike prior works that utilize LoRA and finetune the entire decoder, we critically analyze the contribution of each granular component of SAM on finetuning performance. Thus, we identify specific layers to be federated that are very efficient in terms of communication cost while producing on-par accuracy. Our experiments show that retaining the parameters of the SAM model (including most of the decoder) in their original state during adaptation is beneficial because fine-tuning on small datasets tends to distort the inherent capabilities of the underlying foundation model. On Fed-KiTS, our approach decreases communication cost (~48x) compared to full fine-tuning while increasing performance (~6% Dice score) in 3D segmentation tasks. Our approach performs similar to SAMed while achieving ~2.8x reduction in communication and parameters to be finetuned. We further validate our approach with experiments on Fed-IXI and Prostate MRI datasets.</description>

      <title>U-Net-based Lung Thickness Map for Pixel-level Lung Volume Estimation of Chest X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12509v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: We aimed to estimate the total lung volume (TLV) from real and synthetic frontal X-ray radiographs on a pixel level using lung thickness maps generated by a U-Net.
  Methods: 5,959 thorax X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans were retrieved from two publicly available datasets of the lung nodule analysis 2016 (n=656) and the RSNA pulmonary embolism detection challenge 2020 (n=5,303). Additionally, thorax CT scans from 72 subjects (33 healthy: 20 men, mean age [range] = 62.4 [34, 80]; 39 suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 25 men, mean age [range] = 69.0 [47, 91]) were retrospectively selected (10.2018-12.2019) from our in-house dataset such that for each subject, a frontal chest X-ray radiograph no older than seven days was available. All CT scans and their corresponding lung segmentation were forward projected using a simulated X-ray spectrum to generate synthetic radiographs and lung thickness maps, respectively. A U-Net model was trained and tested on synthetic radiographs from the public datasets to predict lung thickness maps and consequently estimate TLV. Model performance was further assessed by evaluating the TLV estimations for the in-house synthetic and real radiograph pairs using Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and significance testing.
  Results: Strong correlations were measured between the predicted and CT-derived ground truth TLV values for test data from synthetic ($n_{Public}$=1,191, r=0.987, P &lt; 0.001; $n_{In-house}$=72, r=0.973, P &lt; 0.001) and real radiographs (n=72, r=0.908, P &lt; 0.001).
  Conclusion: TLV from U-Net-generated pixel-level lung thickness maps were successfully estimated for synthetic and real radiographs.</description>

      <title>Noise Level Adaptive Diffusion Model for Robust Reconstruction of Accelerated MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, diffusion model-based MRI reconstruction methods incrementally remove artificially added noise while imposing data consistency to reconstruct the underlying images. However, real-world MRI acquisitions already contain inherent noise due to thermal fluctuations. This phenomenon is particularly notable when using ultra-fast, high-resolution imaging sequences for advanced research, or using low-field systems favored by low- and middle-income countries. These common scenarios can lead to sub-optimal performance or complete failure of existing diffusion model-based reconstruction techniques. Specifically, as the artificially added noise is gradually removed, the inherent MRI noise becomes increasingly pronounced, making the actual noise level inconsistent with the predefined denoising schedule and consequently inaccurate image reconstruction. To tackle this problem, we propose a posterior sampling strategy with a novel NoIse Level Adaptive Data Consistency (Nila-DC) operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and an in-house clinical dataset with field strength ranging from 0.3T to 3T, showing that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods, and is highly robust against various noise levels. The code for Nila is available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/Nila.</description>

Abstract: With the wealth of medical image data, efficient curation is essential. Assigning the sequence type to magnetic resonance images is necessary for scientific studies and artificial intelligence-based analysis. However, incomplete or missing metadata prevents effective automation. We therefore propose a deep-learning method for classification of prostate cancer scanning sequences based on a combination of image data and DICOM metadata. We demonstrate superior results compared to metadata or image data alone, and make our code publicly available at https://github.com/deepakri201/DICOMScanClassification.</description>

      <title>Multi-view X-ray Image Synthesis with Multiple Domain Disentanglement from CT Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray images play a vital role in the intraoperative processes due to their high resolution and fast imaging speed and greatly promote the subsequent segmentation, registration and reconstruction. However, over-dosed X-rays superimpose potential risks to human health to some extent. Data-driven algorithms from volume scans to X-ray images are restricted by the scarcity of paired X-ray and volume data. Existing methods are mainly realized by modelling the whole X-ray imaging procedure. In this study, we propose a learning-based approach termed CT2X-GAN to synthesize the X-ray images in an end-to-end manner using the content and style disentanglement from three different image domains. Our method decouples the anatomical structure information from CT scans and style information from unpaired real X-ray images/ digital reconstructed radiography (DRR) images via a series of decoupling encoders. Additionally, we introduce a novel consistency regularization term to improve the stylistic resemblance between synthesized X-ray images and real X-ray images. Meanwhile, we also impose a supervised process by computing the similarity of computed real DRR and synthesized DRR images. We further develop a pose attention module to fully strengthen the comprehensive information in the decoupled content code from CT scans, facilitating high-quality multi-view image synthesis in the lower 2D space. Extensive experiments were conducted on the publicly available CTSpine1K dataset and achieved 97.8350, 0.0842 and 3.0938 in terms of FID, KID and defined user-scored X-ray similarity, respectively. In comparison with 3D-aware methods ($\pi$-GAN, EG3D), CT2X-GAN is superior in improving the synthesis quality and realistic to the real X-ray images.</description>

      <title>Restore-RWKV: Efficient and Effective Medical Image Restoration with RWKV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized medical image restoration, but the quadratic complexity still poses limitations for their application to high-resolution medical images. The recent advent of RWKV in the NLP field has attracted much attention as it can process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Restore-RWKV achieves superior performance across various medical image restoration tasks, including MRI image super-resolution, CT image denoising, PET image synthesis, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

      <title>Novel Hybrid Integrated Pix2Pix and WGAN Model with Gradient Penalty for Binary Images Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to image denoising that leverages the advantages of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Specifically, we propose a model that combines elements of the Pix2Pix model and the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). This hybrid framework seeks to capitalize on the denoising capabilities of conditional GANs, as demonstrated in the Pix2Pix model, while mitigating the need for an exhaustive search for optimal hyperparameters that could potentially ruin the stability of the learning process. In the proposed method, the GAN's generator is employed to produce denoised images, harnessing the power of a conditional GAN for noise reduction. Simultaneously, the implementation of the Lipschitz continuity constraint during updates, as featured in WGAN-GP, aids in reducing susceptibility to mode collapse. This innovative design allows the proposed model to benefit from the strong points of both Pix2Pix and WGAN-GP, generating superior denoising results while ensuring training stability. Drawing on previous work on image-to-image translation and GAN stabilization techniques, the proposed research highlights the potential of GANs as a general-purpose solution for denoising. The paper details the development and testing of this model, showcasing its effectiveness through numerical experiments. The dataset was created by adding synthetic noise to clean images. Numerical results based on real-world dataset validation underscore the efficacy of this approach in image-denoising tasks, exhibiting significant enhancements over traditional techniques. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, performing effectively even when trained with synthetic noise.</description>

      <title>Pediatric Wrist Fracture Detection in X-rays via YOLOv10 Algorithm and Dual Label Assignment System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wrist fractures are highly prevalent among children and can significantly impact their daily activities, such as attending school, participating in sports, and performing basic self-care tasks. If not treated properly, these fractures can result in chronic pain, reduced wrist functionality, and other long-term complications. Recently, advancements in object detection have shown promise in enhancing fracture detection, with systems achieving accuracy comparable to, or even surpassing, that of human radiologists. The YOLO series, in particular, has demonstrated notable success in this domain. This study is the first to provide a thorough evaluation of various YOLOv10 variants to assess their performance in detecting pediatric wrist fractures using the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset. It investigates how changes in model complexity, scaling the architecture, and implementing a dual-label assignment strategy can enhance detection performance. Experimental results indicate that our trained model achieved mean average precision (mAP@50-95) of 51.9\% surpassing the current YOLOv9 benchmark of 43.3\% on this dataset. This represents an improvement of 8.6\%. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/ammarlodhi255/YOLOv10-Fracture-Detection</description>

      <title>SpaER: Learning Spatio-temporal Equivariant Representations for Fetal Brain Motion Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SpaER, a pioneering method for fetal motion tracking that leverages equivariant filters and self-attention mechanisms to effectively learn spatio-temporal representations. Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</description>

      <title>Neural Cellular Automata for Lightweight, Robust and Explainable Classification of White Blood Cell Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagnosis of hematological malignancies depends on accurate identification of white blood cells in peripheral blood smears. Deep learning techniques are emerging as a viable solution to scale and optimize this process by automatic cell classification. However, these techniques face several challenges such as limited generalizability, sensitivity to domain shifts, and lack of explainability. Here, we introduce a novel approach for white blood cell classification based on neural cellular automata (NCA). We test our approach on three datasets of white blood cell images and show that we achieve competitive performance compared to conventional methods. Our NCA-based method is significantly smaller in terms of parameters and exhibits robustness to domain shifts. Furthermore, the architecture is inherently explainable, providing insights into the decision process for each classification, which helps to understand and validate model predictions. Our results demonstrate that NCA can be used for image classification, and that they address key challenges of conventional methods, indicating a high potential for applicability in clinical practice.</description>
