      <title>Constrained B-Spline Based Everett Map Construction for Modeling Static Hysteresis Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a simple and robust method to construct a B-spline based Everett map, for application in the Preisach model of hysteresis, to predict static hysteresis behavior. Its strength comes from the ability to directly capture the Everett map as a well-founded closed-form B-spline surface expression, while also eliminating model artifacts that plague Everett map based Preisach models. Contrary to other works, that applied numerical descriptions for the Everett map, the presented approach is of completely analytic nature. In this work the B-spline surface fitting procedure and the necessary set of constraints are explained. Furthermore, the B-spline based Everett map is validated by ensuring that model artifacts were properly eliminated. Additionally, the model was compared with four benchmark excitations. Namely, a degaussing signal, a set of first-order reversal curves, an arbitrary excitation with high-order reversal curves, and a PWM like signal. The model was able to reproduce all benchmarks with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>How to evaluate your medical time series classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical time series (MedTS) play a critical role in many healthcare applications, such as vital sign monitoring and the diagnosis of brain and heart diseases. However, the existence of subject-specific features poses unique challenges in MedTS evaluation. Inappropriate evaluation setups that either exploit or overlook these features can lead to artificially inflated classification performance (by up to 50% in accuracy on ADFTD dataset): this concern has received little attention in current research. Here, we categorize the existing evaluation setups into two primary categories: subject-dependent and subject-independent. We show the subject-independent setup is more appropriate for different datasets and tasks. Our theoretical analysis explores the feature components of MedTS, examining how different evaluation setups influence the features that a model learns. Through experiments on six datasets (spanning EEG, ECG, and fNIRS modalities) using four different methods, we demonstrate step-by-step how subject-dependent utilizes subject-specific features as a shortcut for classification and leads to a deceptive high performance, suggesting that the subject-independent setup is more precise and practicable evaluation setup in real-world. This comprehensive analysis aims to establish clearer guidelines for evaluating MedTS models in different healthcare applications.

      <title>Memory-distributed level set-based inverse homogenisation of three-dimensional piezoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use level set-based topology optimisation to design three-dimensional periodic piezoelectric materials with enhanced properties. Our methodology is fully memory-distributed and written in Julia using the package GridapTopOpt. We compare and assess several existing iterative solvers with respect to their weak scalability and find that an approximate Schur complement preconditioned GMRES method demonstrates the best performance and scalability for solving the piezoelectric homogenisation equations. We use the developed techniques to computationally design high-resolution piezoelectric metamaterials with enhanced stiffness and piezoelectric properties that yield new insights into material design for sensor, hydrophone, and actuator applications. We suggest two robust structures with simple geometric features that exhibit enhanced piezoelectric properties several times larger than those of the base material. We find that level set-based topology optimisation is well suited to problems involving piezoelectricity and has the advantage of avoiding large regions of intermediate density material.</description>

      <title>Neural networks meet anisotropic hyperelasticity: A framework based on generalized structure tensors and isotropic tensor functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for the multiscale modeling of anisotropic finite strain elasticity based on physics-augmented neural networks (PANNs). Our approach allows the efficient simulation of materials with complex underlying microstructures which reveal an overall anisotropic and nonlinear behavior on the macroscale. By using a set of invariants as input, an energy-type output and by adding several correction terms to the overall energy density functional, the model fulfills multiple physical principles by construction. The invariants are formed from the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor and fully symmetric 2nd, 4th or 6th order structure tensors which enables to describe a wide range of symmetry groups. Besides the network parameters, the structure tensors are simultaneously calibrated during training so that the underlying anisotropy of the material is reproduced most accurately. In addition, sparsity of the model with respect to the number of invariants is enforced by adding a trainable gate layer and using lp regularization. Our approach works for data containing tuples of deformation, stress and material tangent, but also for data consisting only of tuples of deformation and stress, as is the case in real experiments. The developed approach is exemplarily applied to several representative examples, where necessary data for the training of the PANN surrogate model are collected via computational homogenization. We show that the proposed model achieves excellent interpolation and extrapolation behaviors. In addition, the approach is benchmarked against an NN model based on the components of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Unobservable Components of Electricity Demand Response with Inverse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the electricity demand responses to prices are critical activities for system operators, retailers, and regulators. While conventional machine learning and time series analyses have been adequate for the routine demand patterns that have adapted only slowly over many years, the emergence of active consumers with flexible assets such as solar-plus-storage systems, and electric vehicles, introduces new challenges. These active consumers exhibit more complex consumption patterns, the drivers of which are often unobservable to the retailers and system operators. In practice, system operators and retailers can only monitor the net demand (metered at grid connection points), which reflects the overall energy consumption or production exchanged with the grid. As a result, all "behind-the-meter" activities-such as the use of flexibility-remain hidden from these entities. Such behind-the-meter behavior may be controlled by third party agents or incentivized by tariffs; in either case, the retailer's revenue and the system loads would be impacted by these activities behind the meter, but their details can only be inferred. We define the main components of net demand, as baseload, flexible, and self-generation, each having nonlinear responses to market price signals. As flexible demand response and self generation are increasing, this raises a pressing question of whether existing methods still perform well and, if not, whether there is an alternative way to understand and project the unobserved components of behavior. In response to this practical challenge, we evaluate the potential of a data-driven inverse optimization (IO) methodology. This approach characterizes decomposed consumption patterns without requiring direct observation of behind-the-meter behavior or device-level metering [...]</description>

      <title>Never Mind The No-Ops: Faster and Less Volatile Simulation Modelling of Co-Evolutionary Species Interactions via Spatial Cyclic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Issues in co-evolutionary population dynamics have long been studied via computationally intensive simulations of minimally simple agent-based models, known as Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games (ESCGs), involving multiple interacting biological species in which each agent has its own unique spatial location in a cell on a regular lattice, and can move from cell to cell over time. Many papers have been published exploring the dynamics of ESCGs where competitive inter-species predator/prey relationships are modelled via the cyclic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) for three species, or Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) for five. At the core of these simulations is the "Elementary Step" (ES), in which one or two agents are chosen at random to either compete to the death, or to reproduce, or to move location. ESCG studies typically involve executing trillions of ESs and hence the computational efficiency of the core ES algorithm is a key concern. In this paper I demonstrate that the de facto standard "Original ES" (OES) algorithm is computationally inefficient both in time and in space due to the implicit execution of many "no-op" commands (i.e., commands that do nothing) and because at steady state large numbers of cells can be empty, and yet empty cells serve no purpose. I present a new "Revised ES" (RES) algorithm which eliminates these inefficiencies, and I show empirically that ESCGs with RES exhibit qualitatively the same characteristics as those with OES, and are also markedly more stable. The more stable dynamics of RES-based simulations means that they can be run with smaller lattices than when using OES, leading to reductions in total simulation times of 85% or more.

      <title>TOPress3D: 3D topology optimization with design-dependent pressure loads in MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces "\texttt{TOPress3D}," a 3D topology optimization MATLAB code for structures subjected to design-dependent pressure loads. With a primary focus on pedagogical objectives, the code provides an easy learning experience, making it a valuable tool and practical gateway for newcomers, students, and researchers towards this topic. \texttt{TOPress3D} uses Darcy's law with a drainage term to link the given pressure load to design variables that, in turn, is converted to consistent nodal loads. Optimization problems focused on compliance minimization under volume constraints with pressure loads are solved. Load sensitivities arising due to design-dependent nature of the loads are evaluated using the adjoint-variable approach. The method of moving asymptotes is used to update the design variables. \texttt{TOPress3D} is constituted by six main parts. Each is described in detail. The code is also tailored to solve different problems. The robustness and success of the code are demonstrated in designing a few pressure load-bearing structures. The code is provided in Appendix~B and is available with extensions in the supplementary material and publicly at \url{https://github.com/PrabhatIn/TOPress3D}.</description>

      <title>Real-time design of architectural structures with differentiable mechanics and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing mechanically efficient geometry for architectural structures like shells, towers, and bridges is an expensive iterative process. Existing techniques for solving such inverse mechanical problems rely on traditional direct optimization methods, which are slow and computationally expensive, limiting iteration speed and design exploration. Neural networks would seem to offer a solution, via data-driven amortized optimization for specific design tasks, but they often require extensive fine-tuning and cannot ensure that important design criteria, such as mechanical integrity, are met. In this work, we combine neural networks with a differentiable mechanics simulator to develop a model that accelerates the solution of shape approximation problems for architectural structures modeled as bar systems. As a result, our model offers explicit guarantees to satisfy mechanical constraints while generating designs that match target geometries. We validate our model in two tasks, the design of masonry shells and cable-net towers. Our model achieves better accuracy and generalization than fully neural alternatives, and comparable accuracy to direct optimization but in real time, enabling fast and sound design exploration. We further demonstrate the real-world potential of our trained model by deploying it in 3D modeling software and by fabricating a physical prototype. Our work opens up new opportunities for accelerated physical design enhanced by neural networks for the built environment.</description>

      <title>Fast Crystal Tensor Property Prediction: A General O(3)-Equivariant Framework Based on Polar Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the tensor properties of crystalline materials is a fundamental task in materials science. Unlike single-value property prediction, which is inherently invariant, tensor property prediction requires maintaining $O(3)$ group tensor equivariance. This equivariance constraint often introduces tremendous computational costs, necessitating specialized designs for effective and efficient predictions. To address this limitation, we propose a general $O(3)$-equivariant framework for fast crystal tensor property prediction, called GoeCTP. Our framework is efficient as it does not need to impose equivalence constraints onto the network architecture. Instead, GoeCTP captures the tensor equivariance with a simple external rotation and reflection (R&amp;R) module based on polar decomposition. The crafted external R&amp;R module can rotate and reflect the crystal into an invariant standardized crystal position in space without introducing extra computational cost. We show that GoeCTP is general as it is a plug-and-play module that can be smoothly integrated with any existing single-value property prediction framework for predicting tensor properties. Experimental results indicate that GoeCTP achieves higher prediction performance and runs 13$\times$ faster compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in elastic benchmarking datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>
