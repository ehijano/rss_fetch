      <title>$G_2$-instantons on the ALC members of the $\mathbb{B}_7$ family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using co-homogeneity one symmetries, we construct a two-parameter family of non-abelian $G_2$-instantons on every member of the asymptotically locally conical $\mathbb{B}_7$-family of $G_2$-metrics on $S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^4 $, and classify the resulting solutions. These solutions can be described as perturbations of a one-parameter family of abelian instantons, arising from the Killing vector-field generating the asymptotic circle fibre. Generically, these perturbations decay exponentially to the model, but we find a one-parameter family of instantons with polynomial decay. Moreover, we relate the two-parameter family to a lift of an explicit two-parameter family of anti-self-dual instantons on Taub-NUT $\mathbb{R}^4$, fibred over $S^3$ in an adiabatic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with non-negative sectional curvatures and convex boundary, that is conformal to an Euclidean convex bounded domain, we show that it does not contain any compact stable free boundary minimal submanifold of dimension $2\leq k\leq n-2$, provided that either the boundary is strictly convex with respect to any of the two metrics or the sectional curvatures are strictly positive.</description>

      <title>Principal frequency of clamped plates on RCD(0,N) spaces: sharpness, rigidity and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fine properties of the principal frequency of clamped plates in the (possibly singular) setting of metric measure spaces verifying the RCD(0,N) condition, i.e., infinitesimally Hilbertian spaces with non-negative Ricci curvature and dimension bounded above by N&gt;1 in the synthetic sense. The initial conjecture -- an isoperimetric inequality for the principal frequency of clamped plates -- has been formulated in 1877 by Lord Rayleigh in the Euclidean case and solved affirmatively in dimensions 2 and 3 by Ashbaugh and Benguria [Duke Math. J., 1995] and Nadirashvili [Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal., 1995]. The main contribution of the present work is a new isoperimetric inequality for the principal frequency of clamped plates in RCD(0,N) spaces whenever N is close enough to 2 or 3. The inequality contains the so-called ``asymptotic volume ratio", and turns out to be sharp under the subharmonicity of the distance function, a condition satisfied in metric measure cones. In addition, rigidity (i.e., equality in the isoperimetric inequality) and stability results are established in terms of the cone structure of the RCD(0,N) space as well as the shape of the eigenfunction for the principal frequency, given by means of Bessel functions. These results are new even for Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. We discuss examples of both smooth and non-smooth spaces where the results can be applied.</description>

      <title>The geometric Cauchy problem for constant-rank submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth $s$-dimensional submanifold $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+c}$ and a smooth distribution $\mathcal{D}\supset TS$ of rank $m$ along $S$, we study the following geometric Cauchy problem: to find an $m$-dimensional rank-$s$ submanifold $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+c}$ (that is, an $m$-submanifold with constant index of relative nullity $m-s$) such that $M \supset S$ and $TM |_{S} = \mathcal{D}$. In particular, under some reasonable assumption and using a constructive approach, we show that a solution exists and is unique in a neighborhood of $S$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a compact, simply connected manifold with holonomy $\mathrm{G}_2$ that is non-formal. We use the construction method of compact torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$ manifolds developed by D.D. Joyce and S. Karigiannis. A non-vanishing triple Massey product is obtained by arranging the singular locus in a particular configuration.</description>

      <title>Local descriptions of the heterotic SU(3) moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterotic $SU(3)$ system, also known as the Hull--Strominger system, arises from compactifications of heterotic string theory to six dimensions. This paper investigates the local structure of the moduli space of solutions to this system on a compact 6-manifold $X$, using a vector bundle $Q=(T^{1,0}X)^* \oplus {End}(E) \oplus T^{1,0}X$, where $E\to X$ is the classical gauge bundle arising in the system. We establish that the moduli space has an expected dimension of zero. We achieve this by studying the deformation complex associated to a differential operator $\bar{D}$, which emulates a holomorphic structure on $Q$, and demonstrating an isomorphism between the two cohomology groups which govern the infinitesimal deformations and obstructions in the deformation theory for the system. We also provide a Dolbeault-type theorem linking these cohomology groups to \v{C}ech cohomology, a result which might be of independent interest, as well as potentially valuable for future research.</description>

      <title>OGRePy: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present OGRePy, the official Python port of the popular Mathematica tensor calculus package OGRe (Object-Oriented General Relativity) - a powerful, yet user-friendly, tool for advanced tensor calculations in mathematics and physics, especially suitable for general relativity. The Python port uses the same robust and performance-oriented algorithms as the original package, and retains its core design principles. However, its truly object-oriented interface, enabled by Python, is more intuitive and flexible than the original Mathematica implementation. It utilizes SymPy for symbolic computations and Jupyter as a notebook interface. OGRePy allows calculating arbitrary tensor formulas using any combination of addition, multiplication by scalar, trace, contraction, partial derivative, covariant derivative, and permutation of indices. Transformations of the tensor components between different index configurations and/or coordinate systems are performed seamlessly behind the scenes as needed, eliminating user error due to combining incompatible representations, and guaranteeing consistent results. In addition, the package provides facilities for easily calculating various curvature tensors and geodesic equations in multiple representations. This paper presents the main features of the package in great detail, including many examples of its use in the context of general relativity research.</description>

      <title>All-orders moduli for type II flux backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the old problem of determining the exact bulk moduli of generic $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structure flux backgrounds of type II string theory. Using techniques from generalised geometry, we show that the infinitesimal deformations are counted by a spectral sequence in which the vertical maps are either de Rham or Dolbeault differentials (depending on the type of the exceptional complex structure (ECS)) and the horizontal maps are linear maps constructed from the flux and intrinsic torsion. Our calculation is exact, covering all possible supergravity $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structure flux backgrounds including those which are not conformally Calabi--Yau, and goes beyond the usual linear approximation in three important ways: (i) we allow for finite flux; (ii) we consider perturbative higher-derivative corrections to the supergravity action; and (iii) we consider obstructions arising from higher-order deformations. Despite these extensions we find that the spectral sequence reproduces the na\"ive expectations that come from considering the effective superpotential in the small-flux limit. In particular, by writing the moduli in a form that is independent of the K\"ahler potential on the space of ECSs, and arguing the superpotential does not receive higher-derivative corrections, we show that the spectral sequence is perturbatively exact. Further, preliminary results show that a Tian--Todorov-like lemma implies that all the obstructions vanish. This has implications for the tadpole conjecture, showing that such perturbative, higher-order effects do not provide a way of circumventing the bound.</description>

      <title>Approximating Symplectic Realizations: A General Framework for the Construction of Poisson Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the construction of symplectic integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics is well understood, an analogous general theory for Poisson integrators is still lacking. The main challenge lies in overcoming the singular and non-linear geometric behavior of Poisson structures, such as the presence of symplectic leaves with varying dimensions. In this paper, we propose a general approach for the construction of geometric integrators on any Poisson manifold based on independent geometric and dynamic sources of approximation. The novel geometric approximation is obtained by adapting structural results about symplectic realizations of general Poisson manifolds. We also provide an error analysis for the resulting methods and illustrative applications.</description>

      <title>The decoupling of moduli about the standard embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of an elliptic differential complex arising from the infinitesimal moduli of heterotic string theory. We compute these cohomology groups at the standard embedding, and show that they decompose into a direct sum of cohomologies. While this is often assumed in the literature, it had not been explicitly demonstrated. Given a stable gauge bundle over a complex threefold with trivial canonical bundle and no holomorphic vector fields, we also show that the Euler characteristic of this differential complex is zero. This points towards a perfect obstruction theory for the heterotic moduli problem, at least for the most physically relevant compactifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a general Li-Yau inequality for the Helfrich functional where the spontaneous curvature enters with a singular volume type integral. In the physically relevant cases, this term can be converted into an explicit energy threshold that guarantees embeddedness. We then apply our result to the spherical case of the variational Canham-Helfrich model. If the infimum energy is not too large, we show existence of smoothly embedded minimizers. Previously, existence of minimizers was only known in the classes of immersed bubble trees or curvature varifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present finite topological type theorems for open manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature, under almost maximal local rewinding volume. Unlike previous related research, our theorems remove the constraints of sectional curvature or conjugate radius, which were crucial additional assumptions on metric regularity in prior results. Notably, our settings do not necessarily satisfy a triangle comparison of Toponogov type. In fact, the method we adopt also extends to many previous related studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion, called generalized Reifenberg condition, under which we prove a smooth fibration theorem for collapsed manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below, which gives a unified proof of smooth fibration theorems in many previous works (including the ones proved by Fukaya and Yamaguchi respectively). A key tool in the proof of this fibration theorem is the transformation technique for almost splitting maps, which originates from Cheeger-Naber (\cite{CN}) and Cheeger-Jiang-Naber (\cite{CJN21}). More precisely, we show that a transformation theorem of Cheeger-Jiang-Naber (see Proposition 7.7 in \cite{CJN21}) holds for possibly collapsed manifolds. Some other applications of the transformation theorems are given in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria on a Riemannian 3-manifold satisfy the stationary Euler equations for ideal fluids. A stationary solution $X$ admits a large set of ``adapted" metrics in $M$ for which $X$ solves the corresponding MHD equilibrium equations with the same pressure function. We prove different versions of the following statement: an MHD equilibrium with non-constant pressure on a compact three-manifold with or without boundary admits no continuous Killing symmetries for an open and dense set of adapted metrics. This contrasts with the classical conjecture of Grad which loosely states that an MHD equilibrium on a toroidal Euclidean domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with pressure function foliating the domain with nested toroidal surfaces must admit Euclidean symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the problem of prescribing different types of curvatures (principal, mean or Gaussian) on rotational surfaces in terms of arbitrary continuous functions depending on the distance from the surface to the axis of revolution. In this line, we get the complete explicit classification of the rotational surfaces with mean or Gauss curvature inversely proportional to the distance from the surface to the axis of revolution. We also provide new uniqueness results on some well known surfaces, such as the catenoid or the torus of revolution, and others less well known but equally interesting for their physical applications, such as the Mylar balloon or the Flamm's paraboloid.</description>

      <title>Discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary (I) -- Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary in an axiomatic approach, which ensures that the Poincar\'{e} dual of an ideally triangulated surface with boundary has a good geometric structure.Then we classify the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary, which turns out to unify and generalize Guo-Luo's generalized circle packings \cite{GL2}, Guo's vertex scalings \cite{Guo} and Xu's partial discrete conformal structures \cite{Xu22} on surfaces with boundary.This generalizes the results of Glickenstein-Thomas \cite{GT} on closed surfaces to surfaces with boundary. Motivated by \cite{BPS, Zhang-Guo-Zeng-Luo-Yau-Gu}, we further study the relationships between the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary and the hyperbolic trigonometry. Unexpectedly, we find that some subclasses of the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary are closely related to the twisted generalized hyperbolic triangles introduced by Roger-Yang \cite{Roger-Yang}, which does not appear in the case of closed surfaces. Finally, we study the relationships between the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary and the 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry by constructing ten types of generalized hyperbolic tetrahedra. Some new generalized hyperbolic tetrahedra recently introduced by Belletti-Yang \cite{B-Y} naturally appears in the constructions.</description>

      <title>From local isometries to global symmetries: Bridging Killing vectors and Lie algebras through induced vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of symmetries in the realm of manifolds can be approached in two different ways. On one hand, Killing vector fields on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold correspond to the directions of local isometries within it. On the other hand, from an algebraic perspective, global symmetries of such manifolds are associated with group elements. Although the connection between these two concepts is well established in the literature, this work aims to build an unexplored bridge between the Killing vector fields of n-dimensional maximally symmetric spaces and their corresponding isometry Lie groups, anchoring primarily on the definition of induced vector fields. As an application of our main result, we explore two specific examples: the three-dimensional Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Optimality Conditions for Interval-Valued Optimization Problems on Riemannian Manifolds Under a Total Order Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09396v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores fundamental properties of convex interval-valued functions defined on Riemannian manifolds. The study employs generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability to derive KKT-type optimality conditions for an interval-valued optimization problem on Riemannian manifolds. Based on type of functions involved in optimization problems, we consider the following cases:
  1. objective function as well as constraints are real-valued;
  2. objective function is interval-valued, and constraints are real-valued;
  3. objective function as well as constraints are interval-valued.
  The whole theory is justified with the help of examples. The order relation that we use throughout the paper is a total order relation defined on the collection of all closed and bounded intervals in $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Invariant kernels on Riemannian symmetric spaces: a harmonic-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to prove that the classical Gaussian kernel, when defined on a non-Euclidean symmetric space, is never positive-definite for any choice of parameter. To achieve this goal, the paper develops new geometric and analytical arguments. These provide a rigorous characterization of the positive-definiteness of the Gaussian kernel, which is complete but for a limited number of scenarios in low dimensions that are treated by numerical computations. Chief among these results are the L$^{\!\scriptscriptstyle p}$-$\hspace{0.02cm}$Godement theorems (where $p = 1,2$), which provide verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for a kernel defined on a symmetric space of non-compact type to be positive-definite. A celebrated theorem, sometimes called the Bochner-Godement theorem, already gives such conditions and is far more general in its scope, but is especially hard to apply. Beyond the connection with the Gaussian kernel, the new results in this work lay out a blueprint for the study of invariant kernels on symmetric spaces, bringing forth specific harmonic analysis tools that suggest many future applications.</description>
