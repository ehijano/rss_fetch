      <title>Hierarchical Plant Protein Microcapsules for Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Cargo Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscale hydrogels comprised of macromolecular networks have increasingly been used for applications involving cell encapsulation, tissue engineering and for the storage and release of active cargo molecules. However, the majority of such microgels are formed from nonbiodegradable synthetic polymers, involving harmful solvents, or using animal proteins, such as silk and gelatin, which can have a negative environmental impact and lack sustainability. Furthermore, most encapsulation techniques involve either protecting hydrophobic or hydrophilic cargo, but rarely both. In order to address these issues, we employed droplet-microfluidics to develop novel, plant protein microcapsules capable of containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic cargo molecules. The microcapsule structure and cargo release rates were controlled by balancing osmotic pressures between the outer and inner phases of the capsules. Moreover, the digestibility of the microcapsules was comparable with that of pure pea protein, thereby enabling the use of these microcapsules for food and beverage applications. In addition, digestive enzymes can trigger the release of the encapsulated active ingredients, and hence, these microcapsules are well suited for the controlled delivery of active nutraceutical or pharmaceutical ingredients. Finally, we investigated the biodegradability of the microcapsules. It was determined that the plant protein microcapsules exhibited 98.0% biodegradability (as compared with cellulose), thereby fulfilling the biodegradability standards stipulated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14851) for microplastics in freshwater conditions (90%). Hence, the plant protein microcapsules can have numerous applications in the food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, personal care, and agriculture industries.</description>

      <title>Decoding Gray Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a formidable technique for non-invasively characterizing brain microstructure. Biophysical modelling is often necessary to gain specificity to cellular structure. However, designing sensible biophysical models and appropriate dMRI acquisitions is challenging, especially for gray matter (GM), as little is known about typical values of relevant features of braincell morphology contributing to dMRI signal.
  This work addressees this unmet need. We analysed about 3,500 cells from mouse, rat, monkey and human brains to determine statistical distributions of a set of morphological features (structural, topological and shape descriptors) relevant to GM microstructure modelling. Illustrative examples demonstrate how this study can inform biophysical modelling and important implications for biophysical modelling of GM are discussed, enabling the design of more sensible models and suitable data acquisitions.</description>

      <title>Sulfobetaine-Phosphonate Block Copolymer Coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Genomic Locus Targeting and Magnetic Micromanipulation in the Nucleus of Living Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exerting forces on biomolecules inside living cells would allow us to probe their dynamic interactions in their native environment. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles represent a unique tool capable of pulling on biomolecules with the application of an external magnetic field gradient; however, their use has been restricted to biomolecules accessible from the extracellular medium. Targeting intracellular biomolecules represents an additional challenge due to potential nonspecific interactions with cytoplasmic or nuclear components. We present the synthesis of sulfobetaine-phosphonate block copolymer ligands, which provide magnetic nanoparticles which are stealthy and targetable in living cells. We demonstrate for the first time their efficient targeting in the nucleus and their use for magnetic micromanipulation of a specific genomic locus in living cells. We believe that these stable and furtive magnetic nanoprobes represent a promising tool to manipulate specific biomolecules in living cells and probe the mechanical properties of living matter at the molecular scale.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of bacterial growth by antibiotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growth in bacterial populations generally depends on the environment (availability and quality of nutrients, presence of a toxic inhibitor, product inhibition..). Here, we build a general model to describe the action of a bacteriostatic antibiotic, assuming that this drug inhibits essential autocatalytic cycles involved in the cell metabolism. The model can describe various types of antibiotics and confirms the existence of two distinct regimes of growth-dependent susceptibility, previously identified only for ribosome targeting antibiotics. Interestingly, below a certain threshold, a coexistence of two values of the growth rate is possible, which has also been observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Entropic organization of topologically modified ring polymers in spherical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that under high cylindrical confinement, two ring polymers with excluded volume interactions between monomers, segregate to two halves of the cylinder to maximize their entropy. In contrast, two ring polymers remain mixed within a sphere, as there is no symmetry breaking direction [Nat Rev Microbiol, 8, 600-607 (2010)]. Therefore, in order to observe emergent organization of ring polymers in a sphere, we can introduce an asymmetric topological modification to the polymer architecture by creating a small loop and a big loop within the ring polymer. We consider the bead-spring model of polymers where there are only repulsive excluded volume interactions between the monomers ensuring that the organization we observe is purely entropy-driven. We find that for a single topologically modified polymer within a sphere, the monomers of the bigger loop are statistically more probable to be found closer to the periphery. However, the situation is reversed when we have multiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. The monomers of the small loops are found closer to the walls of the sphere. We can increase this localization and radial organization of polymer segments by increasing the number of small loops in each ring polymer. We study how these loops interact with each other within a polymer, as well as with loops of other polymers in spherical confinement. We compare contact maps of multiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. Finally, we discuss the plausible relevance of our studies to eukaryotic chromosomes that are confined within a spherical nucleus.</description>

      <title>How Honeybees Perceive and Traverse Apertures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to fly through openings in vegetation allows insects like bees to access otherwise unreachable food sources. The specific visual strategies employed by flying insects during aperture negotiation tasks remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the visual and geometric parameters of apertures that influence honeybee flight. We recorded honeybees flying through apertures with varying shapes and sizes using high-speed cameras to examine their spatial distribution patterns and trajectories during passage. Our results reveal that the flight of bees was, on average, along the bilateral center of the edges of the aperture irrespective of the size. When apertures were smaller, bees tended to also fly closer to the vertical center. However, for larger apertures, they traverse at lower vertical positions (closer to the bottom edge). The behaviors suggest that honeybees modulate their flight trajectories in response to spatial constraints, adjusting trajectory relative to aperture dimensions. When entering at off-center horizontal positions, bees tended to access the vertical center of the aperture, indicating altitude selection influenced by the curvature of the edge below. This behavior suggests an acute awareness of the vertical and horizontal spatial constraints and a preference for maintaining a curvature-dependent altitude that optimizes safe passage. Our analysis reveals that honeybees modulate speed and altitude above the ventral edge passing beneath them, maintaining a median ventral optic flow of 778 deg/s. This relationship suggests a control mechanism where bees rely on visual information in a narrow ventrally directed field to navigate safely through confined spaces.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Biomolecular Conformational Ensembles with PENSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions -- for example, with various mutations or bound ligands -- in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant for a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurizations and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, e.g., tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps to determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>

      <title>Effective and efficient modeling of the hydrodynamics for bacterial flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions among bacterial cell bodies, flagella, and surrounding boundaries are essential for understanding bacterial motility in complex environments. In this study, we demonstrate that each slender flagellum can be modeled as a series of spheres, and that the interactions between these spheres can be accurately characterized using a resistance matrix. This approach allows us to effectively and efficiently evaluate the propulsive effects of the flagella. Notably, our investigation into bacterial motility near a colloidal sphere reveals significant discrepancies between results derived from the twin multipole moment and those obtained through resistive force theory. Consequently, neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions among cell bodies, flagella, and colloidal spheres may lead to substantial inaccuracies. Our model simplifies bacteria into a series of spheres, making it well-suited for examining bacterial motility near spherical boundaries, as well as the nonlinear deformation dynamics of elastic flagella.</description>

      <title>Magnetization transfer explains most of the $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To identify the predominant source of the $T_1$ variability described in the literature, which ranges from 0.6-1.1 s for brain white matter at 3 T.
  Methods: 25 $T_1$-mapping methods from the literature were simulated with a mono-exponential and various magnetization-transfer (MT) models, each followed by mono-exponential fitting. A single set of model parameters was assumed for the simulation of all methods, and these parameters were estimated by fitting the simulation-based to the corresponding literature $T_1$ values of white matter at 3 T. We acquired in vivo data with a quantitative magnetization transfer and three $T_1$-mapping techniques. The former was used to synthesize MR images that correspond to the three $T_1$-mapping methods. A mono-exponential model was fitted to the experimental and corresponding synthesized MR images.
  Results: Mono-exponential simulations suggest good inter-method reproducibility and fail to explain the highly variable $T_1$ estimates in the literature. In contrast, MT simulations suggest that a mono-exponential fit results in a variable $T_1$ and explain up to 62% of the literature's variability. In our own in vivo experiments, MT explains 70% of the observed variability.
  Conclusion: The results suggest that a mono-exponential model does not adequately describe longitudinal relaxation in biological tissue. Therefore, $T_1$ in biological tissue should be considered only a semi-quantitative metric that is inherently contingent upon the imaging methodology; and comparisons between different $T_1$-mapping methods and the use of simplistic spin systems - such as doped-water phantoms - for validation should be viewed with caution.</description>
