      <title>Extending the Operational Lifetime of Nucleic Acid-Based Electrochemical Sensors via Protection Against Competitive Displacement of Oligonucleotides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleic acid-based electrochemical sensors (NBEs) have emerged as a promising approach to continuous molecular monitoring in vivo. NBEs consist of electrically conducting gold surfaces coated with self-assembled monolayers of a mixture of electrode-passivating alkylthiols and functional alkylthiol-modified oligos. These oligos also display binding sites for the target analyte and redox reporters able to transfer electrons to the underlying gold electrode. Although sufficiently robust for continuous, multi-hour sensing of small molecules and proteins in biological fluids both in vitro and in vivo, NBEs decay over periods longer than 12 hours of continuous operation in these fluids. To address this issue, here we report a biofluid mimetic that can be leveraged to specifically study competitive displacement of oligonucleotides from NBEs, a critical sensor degradation pathway. Using this mimetic, we demonstrate three strategies that drastically mitigate competitive displacement and improve sensor stability in vitro. A combination of these strategies also improves sensor stability in vivo, demonstrated here via sensors emplaced in the brain cortex of live rats.</description>

      <title>Speaker-Independent Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion through Multi-Channel Attention Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel speaker-independent acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) model, overcoming the limitations observed in conventional AAI models that rely on acoustic features derived from restricted datasets. To address these challenges, we leverage representations from a pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) model to more effectively estimate the global, local, and kinematic pattern information in Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) signals during the AAI process. We train our model using an adversarial approach and introduce an attention-based Multi-duration phoneme discriminator (MDPD) designed to fully capture the intricate relationship among multi-channel articulatory signals. Our method achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.847, marking state-of-the-art performance in speaker-independent AAI models. The implementation details and code can be found online.</description>

      <title>Moment-based parameter inference with error guarantees for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of models of biochemical kinetics from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose an inference method for stochastic reaction networks with nonlinear and rational propensities at steady state that provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimisation over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices. Our approach takes observations from the stochastic reaction network and forms moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true stationary moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem), and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common nonlinear biochemical models including the Schl\"ogl model, the toggle switch and post-transcriptional regulation.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Induced Self-Organization of Autonomously Steering Microswimmers: Turbulence, Vortices, and Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of motile microorganisms exhibit a multitude of collective phenomena, including motility-induced phase separation and turbulence. Sensing of the environment and adaptation of movement plays an essential role in the emergent behavior. We study the collective motion of wet self-steering polar microswimmers, which align their propulsion direction hydrodynamically with that of their neighbors, by mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations. The simulations of the employed squirmer model reveal a distinct dependence on the swimmer flow field, i.e., pullers versus pushers. The collective motion of pushers is characterized by active turbulence, with nearly homogeneous density and a Gaussian velocity distribution. Pullers exhibit a strong tendency for clustering and display velocity and vorticity distributions with fat exponential tails; their dynamics is chaotic, with a temporal appearance of vortex rings and fluid jets. Our results show that the collective behavior of intelligent microswimmers is very diverse and still offers many surprises to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production by Underdamped Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy production (EP) is a central quantity in nonequilibrium physics as it monitors energy dissipation, irreversibility, and free energy differences during thermodynamic transformations. Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant. This uncertainty relation allows estimating EP for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We validate the method numerically, through applications to several underdamped systems, to underscore the flexibility in obtaining EP in nonequilibrium Langevin systems.</description>
