      <title>Simulating Bell inequalities with Qibo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present educational material about Bell inequalities in the context of quantum computing. In particular, we provide software tools to simulate their violation, together with a guide for the classroom discussion. The material is organized in three modules of increasing difficulty, and the relative implementation has been written in Qibo, an open-source software suite to simulate quantum circuits with the ability to interface with quantum hardware. The topic of inequalities allows not only to introduce undergraduate or graduate students to crucial theoretical issues in quantum mechanics -- like entanglement, correlations, hidden variables, non-locality --, but also to practically put hands on tools to implement a real simulation, where statistical aspects and noise coming from current quantum chips also come into play.</description>

      <title>Innovative Approaches to Teaching Quantum Computer Programming and Quantum Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field that promises to revolutionize various domains, such as simulation optimization, data processing, and more, by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. This paper outlines innovative pedagogical strategies developed by university lecturers in Finland and Spain for teaching quantum computer programming and quantum software engineering. Our curriculum integrates essential tools and methodologies such as containerization with Docker, Qiskit, PennyLane, and Ocean SDK to provide a comprehensive learning experience. The approach consists of several steps, from introducing the fundamentals of quantum mechanics to hands-on labs focusing on practical use cases. We believe quantum computer programming is an important topic and one that is hard to teach, so having a teaching agenda and guidelines for teaching can be of great help.</description>

      <title>Review Article: Integral Role of Physics in Advancing Pharmacy Education and Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics plays a fundamental role in advancing pharmacy education and research, providing theoretical underpinnings and practical tools necessary to address complex challenges in drug development, delivery, and diagnostics. This review explores the integration of physics into the pharmacy curriculum, highlighting how principles such as fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and spectroscopy (Tokgoz and Sakalli, 2018) enhance students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, it examines the pivotal contributions of physics to pharmaceutical research, including molecular modeling, imaging technologies like MRI and PET, and nanotechnology-driven drug delivery systems. Despite challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration and resource allocation, innovative teaching strategies and laboratory based learning are shown significant promise. Looking forward, the convergence of artificial intelligence and physics, as highlighted by recent Nobel Prize achievements in attosecond physics and bioorthogonal chemistry, is set to revolutionize pharmaceutical sciences, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in drug discovery and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies and errors in traditional approaches to energy in our introductory courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.09480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a critical analysis of the classical approaches to energy subjects, based on the work-energy theorem and the conservation of mechanical energy proposed in the courses of the first years of tertiary education. We show how these approaches present a series of inconsistencies and errors that are a source of conceptual difficulties among students. We then analyze a modern treatment of mechanical courses based on the results of research in physics education over the last 40 years. We place special emphasis on the principle of conservation of energy as one of the fundamental principles of nature, prioritizing the concepts of system, surrounding, and energy transfer and transformation.</description>

      <title>Differences in the attitudes and beliefs about science of students in the physics-mathematics and life sciences areas and their impact on teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For this study, we compared the attitudes and beliefs about science of physical science (physics and mathematics) and life science (biochemistry and biology) students at the beginning of their university degrees using the CLASS (Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) tool. It is worth noting that both groups of students received similar physics courses during their high-school education. Through a detailed analysis of the different categories of the test, we examined the differences in performance in each of the areas that make up the questionnaire. Among other aspects, we found that a considerable percentage of life science students (higher than that of physical science students) adopted a novice type of behavior in problem solving. Finally, we discussed the possible causes of the differences found and their implications for teaching.</description>

      <title>Complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration: a case study on Physics and Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach based on the use of complex networks to analyze the structure and content of curricula. We analyze the concept network built from the final year of a particular high school Physics curriculum, as well as that of Mathematics. We examine the most central nodes in each case, the community structures (coherent units or groupings), and the changes that occurred when the network was considered in isolation or integrated with Mathematics. The results show that the integrated Physics and Mathematics network has a higher average degree compared to the individual networks, driven by numerous interdisciplinary connections. The modularity analysis indicates similarities with the original curriculum layout, but also interesting differences that may suggest alternative ways of organizing the content. The differences between separated and integrated networks also highlights the prominence of certain key concepts.</description>
