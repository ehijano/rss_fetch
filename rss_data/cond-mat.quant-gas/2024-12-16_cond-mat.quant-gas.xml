      <title>Thermomagnetic anomalies in quantum magnon transport caused by tunable junction geometries in cold atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractonic many-body systems are characterized by mobility restrictions on single-particle hopping due to the conservation of higher moments (e.g., dipoles, angular momenta, and quadrupoles). This conservation allows the definition of new symmetries and their physical consequences, with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) being especially intriguing in bosonic systems. Building on previous work [Yuan \textit{et al. arXiv:1911.02876] and [Chen \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2010.03261], we propose a new class of phases called hybrid fractonic superfluids (HFS), where multiple boson species interact and moment hybridization is conserved. We focus on two model series: Model Series A, where moments of the same order from different species are conserved, and Model Series B, where moments of different orders are conserved. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the analysis to higher-order moments. We investigate ground states, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and the spontaneous breaking of charge symmetry, showing that at zero temperature, charge symmetry is partially broken when the spatial dimension is at least $N+1$. This results in off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) driven by particle-hole bound states formed by bosons of different species. In Model Series B, we explore systems conserving mixed dipole-quadrupole moments. Additionally, we construct Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models where the small Hubbard $U$ limit realizes HFS for both series. We analyze mean-field phase diagrams for Model Series A and discuss potential realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, e.g., MW theorems and large-scale numerical studies for Bose-Hubbard models. This article, together with previous work, forms a trilogy of fractonic superfluids to uncover the exotic interplay of SSB physics and fracton physics.</description>

      <title>A high optical access cryogenic system for Rydberg atom arrays with a 3000-second trap lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optical tweezer array of $^{87}$Rb atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4 K cryopumping surface, a &lt;50 K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.</description>

      <title>Entangled states from sparsely coupled spins for metrology with neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum states featuring extensive multipartite entanglement are a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology, with sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. However, robust generation of these states using unitary dynamics typically requires all-to-all interactions among particles. Here, we demonstrate that optimal states for quantum sensing can be generated with sparse interaction graphs featuring only a logarithmic number of couplings per particle. We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.</description>

      <title>Quantum vorticity: a not so effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</description>

      <title>Green's function approach to interacting lattice polaritons and optical nonlinearities in subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sub-wavelength arrays of quantum emitters offer an efficient free-space approach to coherent light-matter interfacing, using ultracold atoms or two-dimensional solid-state quantum materials. The combination of collectively suppressed photon-losses and emerging optical nonlinearities due to strong photon-coupling to mesoscopic numbers of emitters holds promise for generating nonclassical light and engineering effective interactions between freely propagating photons. While most studies have thus far relied on numerical simulations, we describe here a diagrammatic Green's function approach that permits analytical investigations of nonlinear processes. We illustrate the method by deriving a simple expression for the scattering matrix that describes photon-photon interactions in an extended two-dimensional array of quantum emitters, and reproduces the results of numerical simulations of coherently driven arrays. The approach yields intuitive insights into the nonlinear response of the system and offers a promising framework for a systematic development of a theory for interacting photons and many-body effects on collective radiance in two-dimensional arrays of quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantized vortex in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at Dirac point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum impurities in finite-temperature Bose gases: Detecting vortex proliferation across the BKT and BEC transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting vortices in neutral superfluids represents an outstanding experimental challenge. Using stochastic classical-field methods, we theoretically show that a quantum impurity repulsively coupled to a weakly-interacting Bose gas at finite temperature carries direct spectroscopic signatures of vortex proliferation. In two dimensions, we find that a low-energy (attractive) branch in the excitation spectrum becomes prominent when the temperature is tuned across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We explain this red-shifted resonance as originating from the binding of the impurity to vortices, where the bosons density (and hence, the repulsive Hartree energy) is reduced. This mechanism could be exploited to spectroscopically estimate the BKT transition in excitonic insulators. In contrast, in three dimensions, the impurity spectra reflect the presence of vortex rings well below the condensation temperature, and herald the presence of a thermal gas above the Bose-Einstein condensation transition. Importantly, we expect our results to have impact on the understanding of Bose-polaron formation at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models: SU($N$) magnetic $\eta$ pairing, weak ergodicity breaking, and partial integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models in arbitrary dimensions by generalizing the $\eta$-pairing mechanism. Our models include the SU($N$) Hubbard model as a special case. Unlike the conventional two-component case, the generalized $\eta$-pairing mechanism permits the construction of eigenstates that feature off-diagonal long-range order and magnetic long-range order. These states form fragmented fermionic condensates due to a simultaneous condensation of multicomponent $\eta$ pairs. While the $\eta$-pairing states in the SU(2) Hubbard model are based on the $\eta$-pairing symmetry, the exact eigenstates in the $N$-component system with $N\geq 3$ arise not from symmetry of the Hamiltonian but from a spectrum generating algebra defined in a Hilbert subspace. We exploit this fact to show that the generalized $\eta$-pairing eigenstates do not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and serve as quantum many-body scar states. This result indicates a weak breakdown of ergodicity in the $N$-component Hubbard models for $N\geq 3$. Furthermore, we show that these exact eigenstates constitute integrable subsectors in which the Hubbard Hamiltonian effectively reduces to a non-interacting model. This partial integrability causes various multicomponent Hubbard models to weakly break ergodicity. We propose a method of harnessing dissipation to distill the integrable part of the dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of non-thermalization caused by dissipation. This work establishes the coexistence of off-diagonal long-range order and SU($N$) magnetism in excited eigenstates of the multicomponent Hubbard models, which presents a possibility of novel out-of-equilibrium pairing states of multicomponent fermions. These models unveil a unique feature of quantum thermalization of multicomponent fermions, which can experimentally be tested with cold-atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quasicondensation and off-diagonal long-range order of hard-core bosons during a free expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasicondensation in one dimension is known to occur for equilibrium systems of hard-core bosons (HCBs) at zero temperature. This phenomenon arises due to the off-diagonal long-range order in the ground state, characterized by a power-law decay of the one-particle density matrix $g_1(x,y)\sim |x-y|^{-1/2}$, a well-known outcome of Luttinger liquid theory. Remarkably, HCBs, when allowed to freely expand from an initial product state (i.e., characterized by initial zero correlation), exhibit quasicondensation and demonstrate the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order during nonequilibrium dynamics. This phenomenon has been substantiated by numerical and experimental investigations in the early 2000s. In this work, we revisit the dynamical quasicondensation of HCBs, providing a fully analytical treatment of the issue. In particular, we derive an exact asymptotic formula for the equal-time one-particle density matrix by borrowing ideas from the framework of quantum Generalized Hydrodynamics. Our findings elucidate the phenomenology of quasicondensation and of dynamical fermionization occurring at different stages of the time evolution, as well as the crossover between the two.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose a conceptual design for an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering, and we provide the requirements on the beam spectrum and reducible backgrounds such that a detection may be achieved. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>
