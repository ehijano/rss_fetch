      <title>Chaotic almost minimal actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Furstenberg's Theorem on sets in the circle invariant under multiplication by a non-lacunary semigroup, we define a general class of dynamical systems possessing similar topological dynamical properties. We call such systems chaotic almost minimal, reflecting that these systems are chaotic, but in some sense are close to minimal. We study properties of the acting group needed to admit such an action, and show the existence of a chaotic almost minimal $\mathbb{Z}$-action. We show there exists chaotic almost minimal $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$-actions which support multiple distinct nonatomic ergodic probability measures.</description>

      <title>On isolated periodic points of diffeomorphisms with expanding attractors of codimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we consider an $\Omega$-stable 3-diffeomorphism, chain recurrent set of which consists of isolated periodic points and expanding attractors of codimension 1, orientable or not. We estimate a minimum number of isolated periodic points using information about the structure of the attractors.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Ergodic Dynamics in Unique Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) constitutes a highly dynamic subarea within computational complexity theory, intricately linked to the outstanding P versus NP problem. Despite multiple insightful results in the past few years, a proof for the conjecture remains elusive. In this work, we construct a novel dynamical systems-based approach for studying unique games and, more generally, the field of computational complexity. We propose a family of dynamical systems whose equilibria correspond to solutions of unique games and prove that unsatisfiable instances lead to ergodic dynamics. Moreover, as the instance hardness increases, the weight of the invariant measure in the vicinity of the optimal assignments scales polynomially, sub-exponentially, or exponentially depending on the value gap. We numerically reproduce a previously hypothesized hardness plot associated with the UGC. Our results indicate that the UGC is likely true, subject to our proposed conjectures that link dynamical systems theory with computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Variationally consistent Hamiltonian model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though ubiquitous as first-principles models for conservative phenomena, Hamiltonian systems present numerous challenges for model reduction even in relatively simple, linear cases. Here, we present a method for the projection-based model reduction of canonical Hamiltonian systems that is variationally consistent for any choice of linear reduced basis: Hamiltonian models project to Hamiltonian models. Applicable in both intrusive and nonintrusive settings, the proposed method is energy-conserving and symplectic, with error provably decomposable into a data projection term and a term measuring deviation from canonical form. Examples from linear elasticity with realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the advantages of a variationally consistent approach, highlighting the steady convergence exhibited by consistent models where previous methods reliant on inconsistent techniques or specially designed bases exhibit unacceptably large errors.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e, P. Bohl and A. Denjoy. P. Bohl, back in 1916, emphasised the importance of the transfer of the results for the order $k=1$ to the case $k&gt;1$, adding at the same time: "However, any attempt to do so would be hopeless". The following more than hundred years have only confirmed Bohl's forecast. It became clear that a new approach to this problem is needed.
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying certain important conditions. Limit sets and left and right rotation vectors appear in the case $k&gt;1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1$.</description>

      <title>A generalization of van der Corput's Difference Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.01123v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of van der Corput's Difference Theorem in the theory of uniform distribution by establishing a connection with unitary operators that have Lebesgue spectrum. This allows us to show, for example, that if $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty \subseteq [0,1]$ is such that $(x_{n+h}-x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ is uniformly distributed for all $h \in \mathbb{N}$, then $(x_{n_k})_{k = 1}^\infty$ is uniformly distributed, where $(n_k)_{k = 1}^\infty$ is an enumeration of the $1s$ in the classical Thue-Morse sequence. We also establish a variant of van der Corput's Difference Theorem that is connected to unitary operators with continuous spectrum. Lastly, we obtain a new characterization of those sequence $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty \subseteq [0,1]$ for which $(x_{n+h},x_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ is uniformly distributed in $[0,1]^2$ for all $h \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Conley index for multivalued maps on finite topological spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop Conley's theory for multivalued maps on finite topological spaces. More precisely, for discrete-time dynamical systems generated by the iteration of a multivalued map which satisfies appropriate regularity conditions, we establish the notions of isolated invariant sets and index pairs, and use them to introduce a well-defined Conley index. In addition, we verify some of its fundamental properties such as the Wazewski property and continuation.</description>

      <title>Intraspecific and monotone enzyme catalysis with oscillatory substrate and inhibitor supplies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enzyme catalysis in reactors for industrial applications usually require an external intervention of the species for the chemical reactions. We analyze the most elementary open enzyme catalysis with competitive inhibition where a time-dependent inflow of substrate and inhibitor supplies is modeled by almost periodic functions. Under mild conditions we prove global stability of an almost periodic solution for the non-autonomous dynamical system arising from the mass-law action. This predicts a well behaved situation in which the reactor oscillates with global stability.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for Green metrics on hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the first author and Tanaka obtained a large deviation principle comparing two Green metrics on a non-elementary hyperbolic group $\Gamma$ associated to finitely supported, admissable probability measures. The aim of this article is to prove the corresponding central limit theorem. Furthermore, our results apply to various other metrics including length functions associated to Anosov representations and to group actions on hyperbolic metric spaces.
  In the particular case that $\Gamma$ is the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic manifold our work provides a statistical characterisation for the hitting measure of a finitely supported random walk being in the same class as the Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Symmetric periodic Reeb orbits on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long standing conjecture in Hamiltonian Dynamics states that every contact form on the standard contact sphere $S^{2n+1}$ has at least $n+1$ simple periodic Reeb orbits. In this work, we consider a refinement of this problem when the contact form has a suitable symmetry and we ask if there are at least $n+1$ simple symmetric periodic orbits. We show that there is at least one symmetric periodic orbit for any contact form and at least two symmetric closed orbits whenever the contact form is dynamically convex.</description>

      <title>The submodularity of the covolume function in global function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19453v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the submodularity of the covolume function in global function fields. The submodular property is often needed in the study of homogeneous dynamics, especially to define a Margulis function. We proved that the covolume function is submodular when the class group of the global function field is trivial.</description>
