      <title>New Stress-dependent Elastic Wave Velocity Models for Reservoir Rocks with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents new elastic velocity-effective stress laws for reservoir rocks. These models are grounded in previously established correlations between elastic modulus and porosity, which incorporate critical porosity. The accuracy of the models is validated against wave velocities from 38 core samples, yielding coefficients of determination ($\mathrm{R}^2$) of 0.9994 for compressional wave and 0.9985 for shear wave. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the maximum uncertainties for compressional and shear waves are less than $\pm$5.5% and $\pm$7.5%, respectively. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed models, a case study was conducted on three wells in the Northern Carnarvon Basin, where the new elastic wave velocity-effective stress laws produced reliable predictions for velocity logs in the studied formations. The relationships reported herein may prove beneficial for hydrocarbon exploration, production, and ensuring drilling safety in both unconventional and conventional fields.</description>

      <title>Robust Earthquake Location using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate earthquake location, which determines the origin time and location of seismic events using phase arrival times or waveforms, is fundamental to earthquake monitoring. While recent deep learning advances have significantly improved earthquake detection and phase picking, particularly for smaller-magnitude events, the increased detection rate introduces new challenges for robust location determination. These smaller events often contain fewer P- and S-phase picks, making location accuracy more vulnerable to false or inaccurate picks. To enhance location robustness against outlier picks, we propose a machine learning method that incorporates the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. RANSAC employs iterative sampling to achieve robust parameter optimization in the presence of substantial outliers. By integrating RANSAC's iterative sampling into traditional earthquake location workflows, we effectively mitigate biases from false picks and improve the robustness of the location process. We evaluated our approach using both synthetic data and real data from the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. The results demonstrate comparable accuracy to traditional location algorithms while showing enhanced robustness to outlier picks.</description>

      <title>Log-Periodic Power Law Singularities in Landslide Dynamics: Statistical Evidence from 52 Crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landslide movements typically show a series of progressively shorter quiescent phases, punctuated by sudden bursts during an acceleration crisis. We propose that such intermittent rupture phenomena can be described by a log-periodic power law singularity model. Amounting mathematically to a generalization of the power law exponent from real to complex numbers, this model captures the partial break of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance that is inherent to the intermittent dynamics of damage and rupture processes in heterogeneous geomaterials. By performing parametric and nonparametric tests on a large dataset of 52 landslides, we present empirical evidence and theoretical arguments demonstrating the statistical significance of log-periodic oscillations decorating power law finite-time singularities during landslide crises. Log-periodic landslide motions may stem from the interaction between frictional stress drop along geological structures and stress corrosion damage in rock bridges, as well as the interplay of inertia, damage, and healing.</description>

      <title>California Earthquake Dataset for Machine Learning and Cloud Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The San Andreas Fault system, known for its frequent seismic activity, provides an extensive dataset for earthquake studies. The region's well-instrumented seismic networks have been crucial in advancing research on earthquake statistics, physics, and subsurface Earth structures. In recent years, earthquake data from California has become increasingly valuable for deep learning applications, such as Generalized Phase Detection (GPD) for phase detection and polarity determination, and PhaseNet for phase arrival-time picking. The continuous accumulation of data, particularly those manually labeled by human analysts, serves as an essential resource for advancing both regional and global deep learning models. To support the continued development of machine learning and data mining studies, we have compiled a unified California Earthquake Event Dataset (CEED) that integrates seismic records from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center (NCEDC) and the Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC). The dataset includes both automatically and manually determined parameters such as earthquake origin time, source location, P/S phase arrivals, first-motion polarities, and ground motion intensity measurements. The dataset is organized in an event-based format organized by year spanning from 2000 to 2024, facilitating cross-referencing with event catalogs and enabling continuous updates in future years. This comprehensive open-access dataset is designed to support diverse applications including developing deep learning models, creating enhanced catalog products, and research into earthquake processes, fault zone structures, and seismic risks.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Thin Section Image Processing for Pore-Throat Characterization in Tight Clastic Rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11523v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of pore-throat structures in tight sandstones is crucial for understanding fluid flow in hydrocarbon reservoirs and groundwater systems. Both thin-section and Mercury Intrusion Capillary Pressure (MICP) offer insights rock petrophysical parameters. However, thin-section analysis is limited by its 2D nature and subjective interpretation, while MICP provides 3D pore-throat distributions, it lacks direct visualization of pore morphology. This study evaluates AI-assisted thin-section image analysis for pore-throat characterization by comparing its results to MICP-derived measurements. A machine learning-based workflow was developed using color thresholding, K-Means clustering, and medial axis transformation to segment pore structures in thin-section images. Throat width, porosity, and permeability were quantitatively assessed against MICP to determine the accuracy and reliability of the technique. The analysis of 26 sandstone samples outlined differences between the two methods. Thin-section analysis showed porosity values from 1.37% to 53.37%, with average pore-throat sizes between 5.63 micron and 30.09 micron, while permeability estimates ranged from 0.01 mD to 344.35 mD. Correlation analysis showed moderate agreement for throat size (r=0.62) and permeability (r=0.61), but weaker for porosity (r=0.32), highlighting the differences in how each method captures pore connectivity. Results demonstrate that the AI-assisted segmentation provides a scalable and reproducible approach but is constrained by thin-section imaging resolution. While MICP remains reliable for permeability evaluation, its comparison with AI-driven image analysis helps assess the reliability of the method. Future research should refine segmentation algorithms, incorporate pretrained data to validate AI-derived pore-throat attributes for improved reservoir quality assessment and predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>Seismic regularity coefficient changes precede stronger earthquakes in Santorini swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have been analyzing the ongoing seismic swarm in Santorini, Greece, with the Seismic Regularity (dc) and Seismic Strain Dynamics (SSD) coefficients, which quantify temporal changes in seismic process organization and strain energy release. Stronger earthquakes are preceded by characteristic down-up changes of dc. Such a change indicates an increase in the seismic process regularity followed by a fast transition to a more irregular and chaotic seismic regime.</description>

      <title>PreAdaptFWI: Pretrained-Based Adaptive Residual Learning for Full-Waveform Inversion Without Dataset Dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a method that utilizes seismic data to invert the physical parameters of subsurface media by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed waveforms. Due to its ill-posed nature, FWI is susceptible to getting trapped in local minima. Consequently, various research efforts have attempted to combine neural networks with FWI to stabilize the inversion process. This study presents a simple yet effective training framework that is independent of dataset reliance and requires only moderate pre-training on a simple initial model to stabilize network outputs. During the transfer learning phase, the conventional FWI gradients will simultaneously update both the neural network and the proposed adaptive residual learning module, which learns the residual mapping of large-scale distribution features in the network's output, rather than directly fitting the target mapping. Through this synergistic training paradigm, the proposed algorithm effectively infers the physically-informed prior knowledge into a global representation of stratigraphic distribution, as well as capturing subtle variations in inter-layer velocities within local details, thereby escaping local optima. Evaluating the method on two benchmark models under various conditions, including absent low-frequency data, noise interference, and differing initial models, along with corresponding ablation experiments, consistently demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Explaining Earthquake-Induced Liquefaction Potential through Multi-Modal Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10446v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an explainable parallel transformer architecture for soil liquefaction prediction that integrates three distinct data streams: spectral seismic encoding, soil stratigraphy tokenization, and site-specific features. The architecture processes data from 165 case histories across 11 major earthquakes, employing Fast Fourier Transform for seismic waveform encoding and principles from large language models for soil layer tokenization. Interpretability is achieved through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which decompose predictions into individual contributions from seismic characteristics, soil properties, and site conditions. The model achieves 93.75% prediction accuracy on cross-regional validation sets and demonstrates robust performance through sensitivity analysis of ground motion intensity and soil resistance parameters. Notably, validation against previously unseen ground motion data from the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake confirms the model's generalization capabilities and practical utility. Implementation as a publicly accessible web application enables rapid assessment of multiple sites simultaneously. This approach establishes a new framework in geotechnical deep learning where sophisticated multi-modal analysis meets practical engineering requirements through quantitative interpretation and accessible deployment.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh Taylor Instability in Multiple Finite-Thickness Fluid Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general transfer-matrix formalism for determining the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a fluid system with spatially varying density and viscosity. We use this formalism to analytically and numerically treat the case of a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We introduce the inviscid-flow approximation in our transfer-matrix formalism to find analytic solutions in the limit of uniform kinematic viscosity for a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We discuss the applicability of these results and the no-acceleration approximation that also yields analytical solutions in the large viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by vorticity and convergence values larger than the local Coriolis frequency, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a provable finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward linear Poisson problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Taken together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ might be a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Free Inference and Hierarchical Data Assimilation for Geological Carbon Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation will be essential for the management and expansion of geological carbon storage operations. In traditional data assimilation approaches a fixed set of geological hyperparameters, such as mean and standard deviation of log-permeability, is often assumed. Such hyperparameters, however, may be highly uncertain in practical CO2 storage applications where measurements are scarce. In this study, we develop a hierarchical data assimilation framework for carbon storage that treats hyperparameters as uncertain variables characterized by hyperprior distributions. To deal with the computationally intractable likelihood function in hyperparameter estimation, we apply a likelihood-free (or simulation-based) inference algorithm, specifically sequential Monte Carlo-based approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC), to draw posterior samples of hyperparameters given dynamic monitoring well data. In the second step we use an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) procedure to provide posterior realizations of grid-block permeability. To reduce computational costs, a 3D recurrent R-U-Net deep learning-based surrogate model is applied for forward function evaluations. A rejection sampling (RS) procedure for data assimilation is applied to provide reference posterior results. Detailed posterior results from SMC-ABC-ESMDA are compared to those from the reference RS method. Close agreement is achieved with 'converged' RS results, for two synthetic true models, in all quantities considered. Importantly, the SMC-ABC-ESMDA procedure provides speedup of 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to RS for the two cases. A modified standalone ESMDA procedure is introduced for comparison purposes. For the same number of function evaluations, the hierarchical approach is shown to provide superior results for posterior hyperparameter distributions and monitoring well pressure predictions.</description>
