      <title>Using Video Games to Teach Kepler's Laws and Orbital Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics instructors often rely on demonstrations when teaching, using real-time examples to appeal to student intuition or tinkering with a physical system to develop a deeper and more natural understanding of a topic. However, some subjects, like Kepler's laws of planetary motion, are impractical to demonstrate at a human scale, and when reality proves difficult, it is often easier to move to simulations and video games. In particular, using video games in the classroom benefits student learning and allows students to learn practical information that they can transfer to the real world. The video game Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is notable for its commitment to accurate simulation of rockets and orbits, allowing players to explore the in-game solar system with their Kerbal astronauts only if they have mastered the laws of orbital dynamics. In my personal experience, I gained a better intuition about orbits during my years playing KSP than I did in graduate school, a common sentiment within the KSP community. I use KSP in my college introductory astronomy courses to make Kepler's laws more tactile with demonstrations and projects, developing intuition on advanced aspects of rocket science through experiments that are otherwise impractical at interplanetary scales.</description>

      <title>Translating the Force Concept Inventory in the age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study that translates the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) using OpenAI GPT-4o and assess the specific difficulties of translating a scientific-focused topic using Large Language Models (LLMs). The FCI is a physics exam meant to evaluate outcomes of a student cohort before and after instruction in Newtonian physics. We examine the problem-solving ability of the LLM in both the translated document and the translation back into English, detailing the language-dependent issues that complicate the translation. While ChatGPT performs remarkably well on answering the questions in both the translated language as well as the back-translation into English, problems arise with language-specific nuances and formatting. Pitfalls include words or phrases that lack one-to-one matching terms in another language, especially discipline-specific scientific terms, or outright mistranslations. Depending on the context, these translations can result in a critical change in the physical meaning of the problem. Additionally, issues with question numbering and lettering are found in some languages. The issues around the translations of numbering and lettering provide insight into the abilities of the LLM and suggest that it is not simply relying upon FCI questions that may have been part of the LLM training data to provide answers. These findings underscore that while LLMs can accelerate multilingual access to educational tools, careful review is still needed to ensure fidelity and clarity in translated assessments. LLMs provide a new opportunity to expand educational tools and assessments. At the same time, there are unique challenges using LLMs to facilitate translations that this case study examines in detail.</description>

      <title>Hunting for new glitches in LIGO data using community science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO contain many types of noise. Glitches are short bursts of non-Gaussian noise that may hinder our ability to identify or analyse gravitational-wave signals. They may have instrumental or environmental origins, and new types of glitches may appear following detector changes. The Gravity Spy project studies glitches and their origins, combining insights from volunteers on the community-science Zooniverse platform with machine learning. Here, we study volunteer proposals for new glitch classes, discussing links between these glitches and the state of the detectors, and examining how new glitch classes pose a challenge for machine-learning classification. Our results demonstrate how Zooniverse empowers non-experts to make discoveries, and the importance of monitoring changes in data quality in the LIGO detectors.</description>
