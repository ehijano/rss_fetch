      <title>Implications of tristability on localization phenomena: a necking bifurcation's tale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the implication of tristability on localization phenomena in one-dimensional extended dissipative systems. In this context, localized states appear due to the interaction and locking of front waves connecting different extended states. In the tristable regime investigated here two extended uniform states coexist with one periodic Turing pattern. This scenario leads to the transition from the standard-homoclinic-snaking-related localized states associated with uniform-pattern bistability to the collapsed-homoclinic-snaking-related states which arise in a uniform-bistable configuration. We find that this transition is mediated by the emergence of hybrid states through codimension-two necking bifurcations. To perform this study we use bifurcation analysis on a non-variational mean-field model describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of light pulses in passive Kerr cavities.</description>

      <title>Vibrational resonance: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, vibrational resonance has garnered significant interest and evolved into a prominent research field. Classical vibrational resonance examines the response of a nonlinear system excited by two signals: a weak, slowly varying characteristic signal, and a fast-varying auxiliary signal. The characteristic signal operates on a much longer time scale than the auxiliary signal. Through the cooperation of the nonlinear system and these two excitations, the faint input can be substantially amplified, showcasing the constructive role of the fast-varying signal. Since its inception, vibrational resonance has been extensively studied across various disciplines, including physics, mathematics, biology, neuroscience, laser science, chemistry, and engineering. Here, we delve into a detailed discussion of vibrational resonance and the most recent advances, beginning with an introduction to characteristic signals commonly used in its study. Furthermore, we compile numerous nonlinear models where vibrational resonance has been observed to enhance readers' understanding and provide a basis for comparison. Subsequently, we present the metrics used to quantify vibrational resonance, as well as offer a theoretical formulation. This encompasses the method of direct separation of motions, linear and nonlinear vibrational resonance, re-scaled vibrational resonance, ultrasensitive vibrational resonance, and the role of noise in vibrational resonance. Later, we showcase two practical applications of vibrational resonance: one in image processing and the other in fault diagnosis. This presentation offers a comprehensive and versatile overview of vibrational resonance, exploring various facets and highlighting promising avenues for future research in both theory and engineering applications.</description>
