      <title>AgentCAT: An LLM Agent for Extracting and Analyzing Catalytic Reaction Data from Chemical Engineering Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a large language model (LLM) agent named AgentCAT, which extracts and analyzes catalytic reaction data from chemical engineering papers, %and supports natural language based interactive analysis of the extracted data. AgentCAT serves as an alternative to overcome the long-standing data bottleneck in chemical engineering field, and its natural language based interactive data analysis functionality is friendly to the community. AgentCAT also presents a formal abstraction and challenge analysis of the catalytic reaction data extraction task in an artificial intelligence-friendly manner. This abstraction would help the artificial intelligence community understand this problem and in turn would attract more attention to address it. Technically, the complex catalytic process leads to complicated dependency structure in catalytic reaction data with respect to elementary reaction steps, molecular behaviors, measurement evidence, etc. This dependency structure makes it challenging to guarantee the correctness and completeness of data extraction, as well as representing them for analysis. AgentCAT addresses this challenge and it makes four folds of technical contributions: (1) a schema-governed extraction pipeline with progressive schema evolution, enabling robust data extraction from chemical engineering papers; (2) a dependency-aware reaction-network knowledge graph that links catalysts/active sites, synthesis-derived descriptors, mechanistic claims with evidence, and macroscopic outcomes, preserving process coupling and traceability; (3) a general querying module that supports natural-language exploration and visualization over the constructed graph for cross-paper analysis; (4) an evaluation on $\sim$800 peer-reviewed chemical engineering publications demonstrating the effectiveness of AgentCAT.</description>

      <title>From Static Spectra to Operando Infrared Dynamics: Physics Informed Flow Modeling and a Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) is critical to the performance of lithium-ion batteries, yet its analysis via Operando Infrared (IR) spectroscopy remains experimentally complex and expensive, which limits its accessibility for standard research facilities. To overcome this bottleneck, we formulate a novel task, Operando IR Prediction, which aims to forecast the time-resolved evolution of spectral ``fingerprints'' from a single static spectrum. To facilitate this, we introduce OpIRSpec-7K, the first large-scale operando dataset comprising 7,118 high-quality samples across 10 distinct battery systems, alongside OpIRBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark with carefully designed protocols. Addressing the limitations of standard spectrum, video, and sequence models in capturing voltage-driven chemical dynamics and complex composition, we propose Aligned Bi-stream Chemical Constraint (ABCC), an end-to-end physics-aware framework. It reformulates MeanFlow and introduces a novel Chemical Flow to explicitly model reaction trajectories, employs a two-stream disentanglement mechanism for solvent-SEI separation, and enforces physics and spectrum constraints such as mass conservation and peak shifts. ABCC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art static, sequential, and generative baselines. ABCC even generalizes to unseen systems and enables interpretable downstream recovery of SEI formation pathways, supporting AI-driven electrochemical discovery.</description>

      <title>Molecular g-Tensors From Spin-Orbit Quasidegenerate N-electron Valence Perturbation Theory: Benchmarks, Intruder-State Mitigation, and Practical Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular g-tensors for open-shell systems requires a balanced treatment of multireference electron correlation and relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we develop and benchmark spin-orbit quasidegenerate second-order N-electron valence perturbation theory (SO-QDNEVPT2) for g-tensor calculations, treating dynamical correlation and spin-orbit effects consistently within a multistate effective Hamiltonian framework. Two g-tensor approaches are implemented: a spin-free effective Hamiltonian (EH) approach based on second-order response and a Kramers (K) approach that extracts g from spin-mixed SO-QDNEVPT2 states. We assess their performance on a benchmark set of 23 molecules spanning diatomics and small polyatomics, low- to high-spin species, and weak to strong spin-orbit coupling. Across the dataset, SO-QDNEVPT2 improves agreement with experiment relative to state-averaged complete active-space self-consistent field. The EH and K formalisms agree for modest g-shifts but the Kramers approach becomes essential when the shifts become large. We demonstrate that QDNEVPT2 results can be sensitive to intruder-state instabilities that can be effectively mitigated with level-shift or renormalization techniques. We then analyze the dependence of SO-QDNEVPT2 results on key computational parameters, including active space, number of states, state-averaging weights, gauge origin, and basis set. These results establish SO-QDNEVPT2 as a robust framework for computing g-tensors in correlated, relativistic open-shell molecules, offering practical guidelines for its applications.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Quantum Thermodynamics from Extended Path Integral Coarse-Graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine-learning potentials have made molecular dynamics (MD) simulations increasingly predictive by enabling efficient descriptions of electronic quantum effects. However, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) remain largely neglected due to their significant computational cost, limiting MD's ability to capture isotope effects and quantum tunnelling and leading to systematic thermodynamic errors. We extend path-integral coarse-graining (PIGS), a machine-learning approach for qualitatively incorporating NQEs, into a rigorous and accurate method for quantum thermodynamics. Specifically, this extended framework (EPIGS) enables the construction of temperature-transferable effective potentials that rigorously incorporate NQEs into classical MD simulations. Central to EPIGS is an instanton-based free-energy perturbation scheme (RPI-FEP) that provides direct and efficient estimation of the path-integral centroid potential. Benchmarks against full path-integral simulations on representative hydrogen-bonded systems, including liquid water, show that EPIGS reproduces free energies and enthalpies within 0.2 meV/atom at near-classical cost. EPIGS transforms the qualitative PIGS approach into an accurate and scalable route to quantum thermodynamic simulations in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Vibronic Landscape of Excitons in Photosynthetic Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-harvesting and excitation energy transfer in photosynthesis generally involve chlorophyll-molecules, maintained by their host proteins at short distances from each other, this resulting in excitonic coupling. The transfer of excitation energy to the reaction centers consists of exciton migration and relaxation within and between photosynthetic proteins. The dynamics of this process depends on the vibrational modes resonant with the energy gaps between the participating excited states. The precise structure and vibrational landscape of excitons is thus essential knowledge to understand the amazing efficiency of photosynthesis. In this work, we characterize the vibrational properties of excitons in light-harvesting proteins from purple photosynthetic bacteria, which remarkably unveil on how many bacteriochlorophylls they reside and in which proportions. Vibrational spectra obtained from bacteriochlorophylls in proteins generally contain additional vibronic contributions when compared to isolated pigments, opening additional pathways for vibrationally-assisted excitation energy transfer. In contrast, the absence of new vibronic contributions in the spectra of chlorophyll -containing photosynthetic proteins above 100 cm-1 suggests that in oxygenic photosynthesis, vibrationally-assisted excitation energy transfers occurs through vibrational modes of chlorophyll molecules in equilibrium configuration.</description>

      <title>The X-ray absorption spectrum of the propargyl radical, C$_3$H$_3^{\cdot}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a combined experimental and computational study of the near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectrum of the propargyl radical, C$_3$H$_3^{\cdot}$. As a central intermediate in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the propargyl radical is a species of considerable relevance in combustion and astrochemistry and was here generated by pyrolysis from propargyl bromide. The NEXAFS spectrum shows a pronounced band at 282.2 eV corresponding to transitions from carbon 1s orbitals to singly occupied molecular orbitals. Ab initio calculations show that two transitions to the lowest lying states 1 $^2$A$_1$ and 2 $^2$A$_1$, which take place from the C1s orbital of the two terminal carbon atoms, contribute to this band. In addition, a 420 meV spacing of the first band is visible and is assigned to a vibrational progression in the symmetric CH$_2$ stretch. Transitions at higher energies are also described reasonably well by theory. The fragmentation pattern was investigated at the different resonant transitions and shows the cleavage of one as well as both C--C bonds.</description>

      <title>MACE-POLAR-1: A Polarisable Electrostatic Foundation Model for Molecular Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of electrostatic interactions and charge transfer is fundamental to computational chemistry, yet most machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) rely on local atomic descriptors that cannot capture long-range electrostatic effects. We present a new electrostatic foundation model for molecular chemistry that extends the MACE architecture with explicit treatment of long-range interactions and electrostatic induction. Our approach combines local many-body geometric features with a non-self-consistent field formalism that updates learnable charge and spin densities through polarisable iterations to model induction, followed by global charge equilibration via learnable Fukui functions to control total charge and total spin. This design enables an accurate and physical description of systems with varying charge and spin states while maintaining computational efficiency. Trained on the OMol25 dataset of 100 million hybrid DFT calculations, our models achieve chemical accuracy across diverse benchmarks, with accuracy competitive with hybrid DFT on thermochemistry, reaction barriers, conformational energies, and transition metal complexes. Notably, we demonstrate that the inclusion of long-range electrostatics leads to a large improvement in the description of non-covalent interactions and supramolecular complexes over non-electrostatic models, including sub-kcal/mol prediction of molecular crystal formation energy in the X23-DMC dataset and a fourfold improvement over short-ranged models on protein-ligand interactions. The model's ability to handle variable charge and spin states, respond to external fields, provide interpretable spin-resolved charge densities, and maintain accuracy from small molecules to protein-ligand complexes positions it as a versatile tool for computational molecular chemistry and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Regularized Neural Network and Kirchhoff Markov Random Field Framework for Inferring Internal Electrochemical States from Operando Spectromicroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of coupled reaction and transport processes in lithium-ion battery (LIB) composite electrodes remains challenging because key internal states cannot be measured directly. In this study, we develop a physics-integrated, data-driven analysis pipeline to estimate internal electrochemical states from operando microscopic X-ray absorption fine structure ($\mu$-XAFS) hyperspectral data of LIB cathodes with LiPF$_6$ electrolyte. State-of-charge (SOC) maps are first constructed from Co K-edge spectra. To resolve ambiguities in the two-phase reaction region, a physics-regularized three-layer neural network is introduced, enforcing spatial continuity of SOC and current conservation. The inferred SOC dynamics are then incorporated into a Kirchhoff-based Markov random field framework that integrates Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, Ohm's law, and a symmetric Butler-Volmer relation to estimate interfacial current, ionic current, electrolyte potential, and effective ionic conductivity. Application to composite electrodes with different initial electrolyte concentrations (0.3, 1, and 2M LiPF$_6$) reveals distinct reaction propagation behaviors governed by electrolyte concentration-dependent conductivity. The inferred electrolyte concentration distributions show qualitative agreement with independent operando X-ray transmission imaging performed on LIB composite cathodes employing a LiAsF$_6$ electrolyte. This framework enables quantitative visualization of otherwise inaccessible internal transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Molecular Simulations with Machine-Learning Potentials and Semiclassical Approximations to Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of molecules require high-level electronic-structure theory in combination with rigorous methods for approximating the quantum dynamics. Machine-learning approaches can significantly reduce the computational expense of this workflow without any loss of accuracy. We discuss various methods for constructing potential energy surfaces including transfer learning, which requires a minimal number of expensive training points. In this way, we can study chemical reactions at a high level but a low cost. In particular, as the potentials are smooth and differentiable, they enable the use of more advanced semiclassical approximations to quantum dynamics, such as perturbatively corrected instanton theory, which can capture both tunnelling and anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>PackFlow: Generative Molecular Crystal Structure Prediction via Reinforcement Learning Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic molecular crystals underpin technologies ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic electronics, yet predicting solid-state packing of molecules remains challenging because candidate generation is combinatorial and stability is only resolved after costly energy evaluations. Here we introduce PackFlow, a flow matching framework for molecular crystal structure prediction (CSP) that generates heavy-atom crystal proposals by jointly sampling Cartesian coordinates and unit-cell lattice parameters given a molecular graph. This lattice-aware generation interfaces directly with downstream relaxation and lattice-energy ranking, positioning PackFlow as a scalable proposal engine within standard CSP pipelines. To explicitly steer generation toward physically favourable regions, we propose physics alignment, a reinforcement learning post-training stage that uses machine-learned interatomic potential energies and forces as stability proxies. Physics alignment improves physical validity without altering inference-time sampling. We validate PackFlow's performance against heuristic baselines through two distinct evaluations. First, on a broad unseen set of molecular systems, we demonstrate superior candidate generation capability, with proposals exhibiting greater structural similarity to experimental polymorphs. Second, we assess the full end-to-end workflow on two unseen CSP blind-test case studies, including relaxation and lattice-energy analysis. In both settings, PackFlow outperforms heuristics-based methods by concentrating probability mass in low-energy basins, yielding candidates that relax into lower-energy minima and offering a practical route to amortize the relax-and-rank bottleneck.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing life from non-life via molecular frontier orbital energy gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amino acids (AAs) are a key target in the search for life beyond Earth due to their extensive role in the machinery of all known life, persistence over geologic timescales, and analytical detectability. However, AAs can also arise from abiotic processes on planets and in space. For example, material from asteroid Bennu contained 33 AAs, including 15 of the 20 proteinogenic AAs that are fundamental to life's functions. Distinguishing life from non-life based on AAs in a sample remains an unsolved problem, particularly when their isotopic and structural signatures (e.g., chirality) could be altered via physicochemical processes. Here we introduce LUMOS (Life Unveiled via Molecular Orbital Signatures), a statistical framework that distinguishes life from non-life by analyzing the distribution of abundance-weighted HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) values of AAs within a sample. Compilation of AAs datasets from diverse environments and provenances revealed that abiotic samples display highly uniform distributions of AAs HLGs. In contrast, biotic samples show greater variance and preference towards AAs with lower HLG, likely reflecting the need for life to control when, where, and how chemical reactions occur. LUMOS achieves &gt;95% accuracy in distinguishing biotic versus abiotic provenance across diverse environmental and extraterrestrial conditions. These results suggest that varied molecular reactivity within biochemical systems may be a universal feature of life, representing an agnostic biosignature unlinked to the specific set of AAs used by life as we know it. LUMOS is compatible with existing analytical instrumentation, applicable to returned samples or in situ analyses. Broader characterization of abiotic and biotic environments will further refine the chemical boundaries separating biotic from abiotic chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Atomic Layer Deposition Pulse Time through Physics-Informed Bayesian Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process development is often hindered by time-consuming and precursor-intensive tuning cycles required to identify saturation conditions. We introduce a physics-informed Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) framework that autonomously tunes precursor pulse times by integrating a Langmuir adsorption model directly into the Gaussian Process (GP) kernel. A key innovation is a two-stage parameter estimation strategy that decouples noise filtering from physical parameter extraction: the GP first smooths noisy data through standard prediction, then Langmuir parameters are fitted to the noise-filtered GP predictions. This approach effectively separates signal from experimental noise. We evaluate the framework against a standard data-driven GP across four simulated regimes, demonstrating convergence within five iterations, up to fourfold improvement in prediction accuracy, and two to fourfold reduction in precursor usage. Experimental validation using TiO2 deposition via Tetrakisdimethylamido Titanium (TDMAT) and ozone confirms that the physics-informed model accurately identifies saturation times for high-coverage targets ($\geq$95\%), with observed deviations at lower saturation levels providing valuable insight into non-ideal desorption behaviors.</description>

      <title>Trotter Error and Orbital Transformations in Quantum Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation with Trotter product formulae is straightforward and requires little overhead in terms of logical qubits. The choice of the orbital basis significantly affects circuit depth, with localised orbitals yielding lowest circuit depths. However, literature results point to large Trotter errors incurred by localised orbitals. Here, we therefore investigate the effect of orbital transformations on Trotter error. We consider three strategies to reduce Trotter error by orbital transformation: (i) The a priori selection of an orbital basis that produces low Trotter error. (ii) The derivation of an orbital basis that produces a ground state energy free of Trotter error (as we observed that the Trotter error is a continuous function in the Givens-rotation parameter, from which continuity of this error upon orbital transformation can be deduced). (iii) Application of propagators that change the computational basis between Trotter steps. Our numerical results show that reliably reducing Trotter error by orbital transformations is challenging. General recipes to produce low Trotter errors cannot be easily derived, despite analytical expressions which suggest ways to decrease Trotter error. Importantly, we found that localised orbital bases do not produce large Trotter errors in molecular calculations, which is an important result for efficient QPE set-ups.</description>

      <title>Convex Analysis of Relaxation Dynamics in Chemical Reaction Networks and Generalized Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain bounds on the Kullback--Leibler divergence to equilibrium for mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with equilibrium. The associated decay rates are characterized in terms of the singular values of the stoichiometric matrix, convexity parameters, and time-integrated activities via deformed-exponential-type functions. We further extend these bounds within a generalized gradient flow framework. We highlight the biological relevance of this framework: the resulting bounds apply to quasi-steady-state regimes, where long transients and plateau-like behavior are common and functionally important. We illustrate the framework using a catalytic CRN exhibiting plateaus, where the bounds capture slow relaxation induced by local convexity and provide a bound-based approach to quantifying relaxation in CRNs.</description>

      <title>Collective Variable-Guided Engineering of the Free-Energy Surface of a Small Peptide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering the free-energy surfaces (FES) of proteins and peptides is central to controlling conformational ensembles and their responses to perturbations. However, predicting how chemical modifications such as point mutations reshape the FES and shift conformational equilibria remains challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. Building on the Collective Variables for Free Energy Surface Tailoring (CV-FEST) framework, we develop a computational approach that leverages short, unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories to guide mutation analysis. Using the ten-residue beta-hairpin CLN025 and a systematic library of its single-point mutants, we apply Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA) to extract collective variables from the conformational data. We find that the HLDA eigenvector learned solely from short wild-type trajectories provides residue-level insight into the propensity of mutations at specific positions to thermodynamically stabilize or destabilize the folded state. Extending this analysis, we show that shifts in the leading HLDA eigenvalue across mutants, a measure of changes in separability between the conformational ensembles along the HLDA coordinate, correlate strongly with mutation-induced changes in the free-energy difference between states, as reflected in melting temperatures. Benchmarked against Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics simulations, these findings suggest a promising and computationally affordable route toward guiding the engineering of biomolecular free-energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>The interplay of cation/anion and monovalent/divalent selectivity in negatively charged nanopores: local charge inversion and anion leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) is widely regarded as a hallmark of calcium versus monovalent ion selectivity in negatively charged pores. While AMFE is well understood in highly cation-selective narrow ion channels, its microscopic origin in wide synthetic nanopores, where anions may also contribute to transport, remains less clear. Here, we use a reduced Nernst-Planck + Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo framework to study ionic transport in a negatively charged PET nanopore, with particular emphasis on how the modeling of surface carboxyl (COO$^{-}$) groups influences charge inversion, ionic currents, and AMFE. We systematically compare fixed point-charge models and explicit-particle representations of surface oxygens and identify two controlling parameters: the distance of closest approach (DCA) between ionic charges and pore charges and grid spacing that modulates localization (while keeping average surface charge constant). By fitting pore diffusion coefficients to three experimental conductance points, we reproduce the entire experimental AMFE curve as well as anion leakage in CaCl$_2$ seen in experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, vastly different microscopic models of the surface groups yield indistinguishable device-level conductance curves when the DCA is matched, despite substantial differences in local Ca$^{2+}$ concentration profiles. Our results demonstrate that AMFE in wide nanopores is governed by a delicate interplay between charge inversion, anion leakage, and ionic mobility, underlying that in wide pores monovalent vs.\ divalent cation selectivity is modulated by cations vs.\ anion selecivity.</description>

      <title>Halogen-Terminated Carbon Atomic Wires by Laser Ablation in Halogenated Organic Solvents: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of halogenated carbon atomic wires (halopolyynes) via pulsed laser ablation in liquid and their comprehensive Raman characterization. Using dichloromethane and dibromomethane-containing solutions, we produced polydisperse mixtures of monohalogenated (HC$_{2n}$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_{2n}$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=3-10). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled separation and analysis of these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectrometry confirmed their molecular structures. A possible formation mechanism is proposed, involving carbon chain polymerization and termination by hydrogen and halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy reveal that halogen terminations act as auxochromes through p-$\pi$ conjugation between their lone-pair electrons and the sp-carbon backbone, extending effective conjugation length. This interaction reduces bond length alternation and moderately redshifts vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement and vibrational anharmonicity consistent with carbyne-like materials. These findings expand the synthetic approaches for halogenated carbon atomic wires and establish halopolyynes as a platform for tailoring electronic and optical properties of sp-carbon wires.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Calculations of the Static and Dynamic Polarizability of BaOH</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the static and dynamic polarizability of the barium monohydroxide ($^{138}$BaOH) molecule, using relativistic coupled-cluster theory. By thoroughly investigating the dependence of the calculated polarizabilities on computational parameters (basis set size, treatment of relativity, level of treatment of electron correlation, and vibrational corrections), a procedure to determine uncertainties is constructed and applied. The dipole moment of BaOH is also calculated and compared to experiment, confirming the accuracy of the predicted polarizabilities. The static and dynamic ($\lambda=1064\;\text{nm}$) polarizability was calculated for both the ground state and the (010) vibrational bending mode, the latter state being particularly interesting for a wide range of quantum experiments. The ground state static polarizabilities were calculated to be 200.8(24) a.u. and 297(5) a.u. for the parallel and perpendicular components respectively.</description>

      <title>Effects of Hydrogen Transport on the Kinetic Regimes of 4-Nitrophenol Reduction by Sodium Borohydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NiP) with sodium borohydride is widely used to benchmark heterogeneous catalysts, yet its kinetics are commonly oversimplified as pseudo-first-order. In reality, borohydride hydrolysis and hydrogenation by dissolved hydrogen proceed concurrently, making hydrogen transport a decisive factor in shaping apparent activity. Re-examining data on Pt-SiO2 supraparticles with different pore structures, we attribute contrasting kinetic behavior to distinct regimes of hydrogen transport: diffusive transport sustains pseudo-first-order kinetics, while bubble-mediated escape causes hydrogen loss and incomplete conversion. We propose a kinetic model that captures this transition and enables consistent interpretation of experimental data. More broadly, our analysis shows that apparent differences in activity during 4-NiP benchmarking can arise from hydrogen transport rather than intrinsic properties of the catalyst, underscoring the need to account for transport effects when comparing catalyst performance.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in dipolar liquids: the role of annealed positional disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric order in polar liquids has been observed in numerical simulations and liquid-crystal experiments. In mean-field frameworks, this behavior is associated to sample-shape dependent, surface contribution to the free energy. This remain nonzero in the thermodynamic limit due to the long-range nature of dipolar interactions. Yet, numerical simulations performed under conducting periodic boundary conditions, where surface term vanishes, still exhibit ferroelectric order, pointing to an intrinsic bulk origin of the transition. Moving beyond the mean-field approximation, Kirkwood seminal study on the dielectric properties of polar liquids highlights the role of hindered dipole rotation in shaping the corresponding pair correlations. In that study, hindered rotation stems from the mean force between nearest-neighbor dipoles, pointing the focus on local structure. Introducing a different perspective while retaining the central role of hindered dipole rotation in the onset of ferroelectricity, the present study establishes, as an original finding, that annealed averaging over positional disorder of dipolar interaction generates hindered rotation of dipole pairs in the liquid, able to drive a ferroelectric phase transition. As a result, in contrast to approaches centered on local structure, ferroelectricity emerges not in spite of the liquid nature, but exactly because the positional degrees of freedom remain liquid. This ferroelectric phase transition is shown to be intrinsic to the bulk. Annealed positional disorder defines an effective dipolar interaction that is shorter ranged than the bare potential. Derived within classical density functional theory, these findings are exact for infinite dimensional and remain valid within the optimized cluster expansion for finite dimensions larger than two.</description>

      <title>Reassessing carotenoid photophysics -- new light on dark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carotenoid molecules are critical in photosynthesis, performing functions at the heart of both light-harvesting and photo-protection. As both these processes involve excitation energy transfer, fully understanding them requires a precise de-scription of the electronic states involved. The excited state manifold of carotenoids is not yet fully characterised, how-ever, and includes several dark electronic states that remain elusive. Using femtosecond stimulated resonance Raman spectroscopy, where the vibrational contributions of each excited state can be observed selectively as a function of the Raman excitation, we reveal the nature and symmetry of no less than three different dark states. These results end long-standing controversies in carotenoid research, shining new light on the photophysics of these essential molecules and establishing a spectroscopic framework for characterising their multiple roles.</description>

      <title>IEPDYN: Integral-equation formalism of population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the integral-equation formalism of population dynamics (IEPDYN) to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The IEPDYN method is formulated in continuous time and therefore does not rely on a coarse-grained timescale (lag time). Consequently, kinetic quantities obtained from IEPDYN are free from lag-time dependence, which has been discussed as a limitation in other approaches. We apply the IEPDYN method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the IEPDYN method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the IEPDYN method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding systems whose characteristic timescales are far beyond those directly accessible by brute-force MD simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. The new mechanism is distinct to the known spin-orbit coupling induced intersystem crossing, and it can enhance the overall intersystem crossing rate. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are possible to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</description>

      <title>Sub-1-Angstrom-Resolution Imaging Reveals Phase Contrast Transition in Ice Ih Caused by Basal Stacking Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of $(\frac{2}{3} a_{1} + \frac{1}{3} a_{2})$, produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [111] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.</description>
