      <title>A case for Bragg diffraction by a noncollinear (PT)-symmetric antiferromagnet Cu$_2$(MoO$_4$)(SeO$_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic compounds chromium sesquioxide (Cr$_2$O$_3$) and dioxomolybdenum selenite present linear magnetoelectric effects. Anti-inversion symmetry in the corresponding magnetic crystal classes dictate the makeup of magnetic Bragg diffraction patterns. Copper axial and polar magnetic multipoles contribute to resonant x-ray and magnetic neutron amplitudes in a symmetry informed analysis of monoclinic Cu$_2$(MoO$_4$)(SeO$_3$) presented with a view to steering future diffraction experiments. The compound might be viewed as a low-dimensional quantum magnet on account of its crystal structure and extreme Cu spin (S = 1/2).</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek Behavior in the Boundary-obstructed Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a two-dimensional higher-order topological insulator when the system is slowly quenched across the boundary-obstructed phase transition, which is characterized by edge band gap closing.
  We find that the number of excitations produced after the quench exhibits power-law scaling behaviors with the quench rate. Boundary conditions can drastically modify the scaling behaviors: The scaling exponent is found to be $\alpha=1/2$ for hybridized and fully open boundary conditions, and $\alpha=2$ for periodic boundary condition. We argue that the exponent $\alpha=1/2$ cannot be explained by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism unless we adopt an effective dimension $d^{\rm eff}=1$ instead of the real dimension $d=2$. For comparison, we also investigate the slow quench dynamics across the bulk-obstructed phase transitions and a single multicritical point, which obeys the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with dimension $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Topological magnons in a collinear altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model with Weyl magnons and weak topological magnons ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) in a collinear altermagnet on the honeycomb lattice. Altermagnetic magnon bands can be realized by breaking the symmetry of the second nearest neighbor exchange couplings without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Besides the Chern number and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, chirality is important to describe the band topology. The model shows the nonzero magnon Nernst effect for both the strong and weak topological phases when a longitudinal temperature gradient exists. Furthermore, we find the orbital angular momentum induced purely by the topology of magnons, which can be probed by the Einstein-de Haas effect.</description>

      <title>Large Nernst Effect in a layered metallic antiferromagnet EuAl$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large Nernst effect is advantageous for developing transverse Nernst thermoelectric generators or Ettingshausen coolers within a single component, avoiding the complexity of electron- and hole-modules in longitudinal Seebeck thermoelectric devices. We report a large Nernst signal reaching 130 uV/K at 8 K and 13 T in the layered metallic antiferromagnet EuAl$_2$Si$_2$. Notably, this large transverse Nernst thermopower is two orders of magnitude greater than its longitudinal counterpart. The Nernst coefficient peaks around 4 K and 8 K at 3 T and 13 T, respectively. At similar temperatures, both the Hall coefficient and the Seebeck signal change sign. Additionally, nearly compensated electron- and hole-like carriers with high mobility ($\sim$ 4000 cm$^2$/Vs at 4 K) are revealed from the magnetoconductivity. These findings suggest that the large Nernst effect and vanishing Seebeck thermopower in EuAl$_2$Si$_2$ are due to the compensated electron- and hole-like bands, along with the high mobility of the Weyl band near the Fermi level. Our results underscore the importance of band compensation and topological fermiology in achieving large Nernst thermopower and exploring potential Nernst thermoelectric applications at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>SiO$_2$-mediated facile hydrothermal synthesis of spiroffite-type Co$_2$Te$_3$O$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrothermal synthesis of novel materials typically relies on both knowledge of the redox activities of all cations present in the reaction solution and a small toolset of so-called mineralizers to tune the solution's overall chemical potential. Upon the use of a less conventional mineralizer species, SiO$_2$, we show the stabilization of spiroffite-type Co$_2$Te$_3$O$_8$ under less forceful hydrothermal conditions than in previous reports. When synthesized in the presence of both SiO$_2$ and each respective alkali carbonate as a secondary mineralizer, silicon substitution in place of tellurium in the host structure becomes apparent, and the corresponding introduced disorder gives rise to enhanced low-temperature ferromagnetism. Our results highlight the complexities of underutilized and combined mineralizer species in the stabilization and tuning of complex magnetic ground states via hydrothermal synthesis techniques.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Ballistic Majorana Nanowire Devices" by Gul et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2018</title>

Abstract: This work re-analyzes Gul et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2018 "Ballistic Majorana nanowire devices" using fuller data from the original experiments released in 2023 on Zenodo. The authors have prepared a correction to their article that appeared in Nature Nanotechnology in 2024. However, the correction does not address the concerns we identify here. We demonstrate that the fuller data contain extensive evidence for quantum dots and disorder that are completely inconsistent with the authors' conclusion that they have achieved ballistic devices containing zero bias peaks of likely Majorana origin. We show how data selection, data cropping and undisclosed data processing played a role in composing the figures of the final published paper.</description>

      <title>Designing Phase Sensitive Probes of Monopole Superconducting Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinct from familiar $s$-, $p$-, or $d$-wave pairings, the monopole superconducting order represents a novel class of pairing order arising from nontrivial monopole charge of the Cooper pair. In the weak-coupling regime, this order can emerge when pairing occurs between Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers in, for example, doped Weyl semimetal systems. However, the phase of monopole pairing order is not well-defined over an entire Fermi surface, making it challenging to design experiments sensitive to both its symmetry and topology. To address this, we propose a scheme based on symmetry and topological principles to identify this elusive pairing order through a set of phase-sensitive Josephson experiments. By examining the discrepancy between global and local angular momentum of the pairing order, we can unveil the monopole charge of the pairing order. We demonstrate the proposed probe of monopole pairing order through analytic and numerical studies of Josephson coupling in models of monopole superconductor junctions. This work opens a promising avenue to uncover the unique topological properties of monopole pairing orders and to distinguish them from known pairing orders based on spherical harmonic symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider entropy generating flows for fluids that achieve a steady state in the presence of a driving electric field. Having chosen one among the space of stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and momentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we find that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent conductivity must be identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to the observable AC or DC charge conductivities.</description>

      <title>Absence of gapless Majorana edge modes in few-leg bosonic flux ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for Majorana excitations has seen tremendous efforts in recent years, ultimately aiming for their individual controllability in future topological quantum computers. A promising framework to realize such exotic Majorana fermions are topologically ordered non-Abelian phases of matter, such as certain fractional quantum Hall states. Quantum simulators provide unprecedented controllability and versatility to investigate such states, and developing experimentally feasible schemes to realize and identify them is of immediate relevance. Motivated by recent experiments, we consider bosons on coupled chains, subjected to a magnetic flux and experiencing Hubbard repulsion. At magnetic filling factor $\nu=1$, similar systems on cylinders have been found to host the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state in the bulk. Here, we address the question whether more realistic few-leg ladders can host this exotic state and its chiral Majorana edge states. To this end, we perform extensive DMRG simulations and determine the central charge of the ground state. While we do not find any evidence of gapless Majorana edge modes in systems of up to six legs, exact diagonalization of small systems reveals evidence for the Pfaffian state in the entanglement structure. By systematically varying the number of legs and monitoring the appearance and disappearance of this signal, our work highlights the importance of finite-size effects for the realization of exotic states in experimentally realistic systems.</description>

      <title>De Haas-van Alphen effect and quantum oscillations as a function of temperature in correlated insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study a model of excitonic insulators which show de Haas-van Alphen oscillations as well as periodic dependence of the magnetization on inverse temperature. The insulating behavior is due to the Coulomb interaction driven hybridization of fermions at the crossing point of their energy bands. We study this hybridization self-consistently and recover known results by A. Allocca and N. Cooper, SciPost Phys. {\bf 12}, 123 (2022). In addition to known results, we show that the hybridization gap decreases with the magnetic field which corresponds to the diamagnetism. Furthermore, we show that the amplitude of the de Haas-van Alphen is oscillating with inverse temperature with a period defined by a combination of the hybridization gap and magnetic field. We analytically obtain the position and the height of the first and dominant peak of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Transitions in La2CoTiO6: Antiferromagnetic Insulator to Nonmagnetic Metal via Antiferromagnetic Metal in a Double Perovskite Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In double perovskite oxides (A$_2$BB$^\prime$O$_6$), magnetism often arises from diluted magnetic lattices, created by combining a perovskite structure with localized 3$d$ magnetic elements (B) alongside another perovskite lattice containing nearly nonmagnetic delocalized 4$d$/$5d$ elements (B$^\prime$). Alternatively, the magnetic lattice can consist entirely of 3$d$ elements, with one being completely nonmagnetic with $d^0$ state. La$_2$CoTiO$_6$ (LCTO), a representative double perovskite oxide, contains Ti in a nonmagnetic state with a $d^0$ electron configuration due to its $4^+$ oxidation state. Experimental evidence shows that LCTO possesses a monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) and behaves as an antiferromagnet with a N\'{e}el temperature of 14.6 K. Through first-principle electronic structure calculations, we uncover that adjusting external hydrostatic pressure induces a sequence of phase transitions: from antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM-I) to antiferromagnetic metal (AFM-M), and ultimately to itinerant nonmagnetic metal (NM-M). The transition from AFM-I to AFM-M at $\sim$ 42 GPa pressure coincides with a shift in spin states, moving from a high-spin (HS) state to a low-spin (LS) state, while Co retains a $d^7$ configuration. Distortion within the monoclinic structure under pressure plays a pivotal role in the spin-state transition. At the AFM-I to AFM-M transition, we observe a sharp decrease in the ratio of the octahedral volumes occupied by Co and Ti. Such change in ratio is linked to variations in octahedral volumes, akin to a breathing mode distortion. We explore the impact of the breathing mode distortion by examining a highly symmetric theoretical structure (space-group $I4/mmm$), achieved by optimizing the structure with all $\angle${Co-O-Ti} angles set to 180$^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Composite subsystem symmetries and decoration of sub-dimensional excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux binding is a mechanism that is well-understood for global symmetries. Given two systems, each with a global symmetry, gauging the composite symmetry instead of individual symmetries corresponds to the condensation of the composite of gauge charges belonging to individually gauged theories and the binding of the gauge fluxes. The condensed composite charge is created by a "short" string given by the new minimal coupling corresponding to the composite symmetry. This paper studies what happens when combined subsystem symmetries are gauged, especially when the component charges and fluxes have different sub-dimensional mobilities. We investigate $3+1$D systems with planar symmetries where, for example, the planar symmetry of a planon charge is combined with one of the planar symmetries of a fracton charge. We propose the principle of $\textit{Remote Detectability}$ to determine how the fluxes bind and potentially change their mobility. This understanding can then be used to design fracton models with sub-dimensional excitations that are decorated with excitations having nontrivial statistics or non-abelian fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely-used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid phase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite-temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized DC conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called \textit{Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase} of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arises under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a calculation scheme using \textit{ab initio} tight-binding Hamiltonians to evaluate biquadratic magnetic interactions. This approach relies on the spin cluster expansion combined with the disordered local moment (DLM) method, originally developed within the multiple scattering Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method. Applying it to the two-orbital Hubbard model, we show that the evaluated DLM biquadratic interactions agree well with those obtained from the strongly correlated limit, demonstrating wide applicability {of the method} to various magnetic systems with large local moments. We then apply it to the \textit{ab initio} tight-binding models for bcc Fe and fcc Ni; the resulting magnetic interactions align well with previous studies in the literature. The present approach offers a convenient \textit{ab initio} path for evaluating biquadratic interactions and understanding the electronic mechanisms controlling them.</description>

Abstract: Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors have enabled the discovery of superconductivity, ferromagnetism, correlated insulators and a series of new topological phases of matter. However, the connection between these electronic phases and the underlying band structure singularities in these materials has remained largely unexplored. Here, combining the magnetic circular dichroism and electronic compressibility measurements, we investigate the influence of a van Hove singularity on the correlated phases in bilayer WSe2 with twist angle between 2-3 degrees. We demonstrate stabilizing the Stoner ferromagnetism below moir\'e lattice filling one and Chern insulators at filling one by tuning the van Hove singularity cross the Fermi level using the electric and magnetic fields. The experimental observations are supported by the continuum model band structure calculations. Our results highlight the prospect of engineering the electronic phases by tunable van Hove singularities.</description>

      <title>Discovering classical spin liquids by topological search of high symmetry nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin liquids are a paradigmatic example of a non-trivial state of matter, and the search for new spin liquids is a key direction of physics, chemistry, and materials science. Geometric frustration -- where the geometry of the net that the spins occupy precludes the generation of a simple ordered state -- is a particularly fruitful way to generate these intrinsically disordered states. A particular focus has been on a handful of high symmetry nets. There are, however, many three-dimensional nets, each of which has the potential to form unique states. In this paper, we investigate the high symmetry nets -- those which are both node- and edge-transitive -- for the simplest possible interaction sets: nearest-neighbor couplings of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and Ising spins. While the well-known crs (pyrochlore) net is the only nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet which does not order, we identify two new frustrated nets (lcx and thp) that possess finite temperature Heisenberg spin-liquid states with strongly suppressed magnetic ordering and non-collinear ground states. With Ising spins, we identify three new classical spin liquids that do not order down to $T/J = 0.01$. We highlight materials that contain these high symmetry nets, and which could, if substituted with appropriate magnetic ions, potentially host these unusual states. Our systematic survey will guide searches for novel magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Collective flow of fermionic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

Abstract: Interacting mixtures of bosons and fermions are ubiquitous in nature. They form the backbone of the standard model of physics, provide a framework for understanding quantum materials and are of technological importance in helium dilution refrigerators. However, the description of their coupled thermodynamics and collective behaviour is challenging. Bose-Fermi mixtures of ultracold atoms provide a platform to investigate their properties in a highly controllable environment, where the species concentration and interaction strength can be tuned at will. Here we characterize the collective oscillations of spin-polarized fermionic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the interaction strength and temperature. For strong interactions, the Fermi gas perfectly mimics the superfluid hydrodynamic modes of the condensate, from low-energy quadrupole modes to high-order Faraday excitations. With an increasing number of bosonic thermal excitations, the dynamics of the impurities cross over from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, reminiscent of the emergence of hydrodynamics in two-dimensional electron fluids.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>From Architectures to Applications: A Review of Neural Quantum States</title>

Abstract: Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system size, the simulation of quantum many-body systems has remained a persistent challenge until today. Here, we review a relatively new class of variational states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS), which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at mirror and twistronic twin boundaries in van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>

Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, 3R-MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarisation, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that assembling pairs of mono-twin films with a `magic' twist angle $\theta^*$ that provides commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, and we specify the values of $\theta^*$ for homo- and heterostructures of various TMDs.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>

Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>
