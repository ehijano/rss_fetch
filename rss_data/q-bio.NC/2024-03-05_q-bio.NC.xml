      <title>Operators' cognitive performance under extreme hot-humid exposure and its physiological-psychological mechanism based on ECG, fNIRS, and Eye Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operators' cognitive functions are impaired significantly under extreme heat stress, potentially resulting in more severe secondary disasters. This research investigated the impact of elevated temperature and humidity (25 60%RH, 30 70%RH, 35 80%RH, 40 90%RH) on the cognitive functions and performance of operators. Meanwhile, we explored the psychological-physiological mechanism underlying the change in performance by electrocardiogram (ECG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and eye tracking physiologically. Psychological aspects such as situation awareness, workload, and working memory were assessed. Eventually, we verified and extended the maximal adaptability model to the extreme condition. Unexpectedly, a temporary improvement in simple reaction tasks but rapid impairment in advanced cognitive functions (i.e. situation awareness, communication, working memory) was obtained above 35 WBGT. The best performance in a suitable environment was due to more effective activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). With temperature increasing, more mistakes occurred and comprehension was impaired due to drowsiness and lower arousal levels, according to evidence of compensatory effect in fNIRS. In the extreme environment, the enhanced PFC cooperation with higher functional connectivity resulted in a temporary improvement, while depressed activation in PFC, heavy physical load, and poor regulation of the cardiovascular system restricted it. Our results provide a detailed study of the process of operators' performance and cognitive functions when encountering increasing heat stress, as well as its underlying mechanisms from a neuroergonomics perspective. This can contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between operators' performance and workplace conditions, and help to achieve a more reliable human-centered production system in the promising era of Industry 5.0.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Resting-State fMRI Data in Marijuana Users via High-Order Attention Brain Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustained use of marijuana significantly impacts the lives and health of people. In this study, we propose an interpretable novel framework called the HOGAB (High-Order Attention Graph Attention Neural Networks) model to analyze local abnormal brain activity in chronic marijuana users in two datasets. The HOGAB integrates dynamic intrinsic functional networks with LSTM technology to capture temporal patterns in fMRI time series of marijuana users. Moreover, we use the high-order attention module in neighborhood nodes for information fusion and message passing, enhancing community clustering analysis for long-term marijuana users. Furthermore, we improve the overall learning ability of the model by incorporating attention mechanisms, achieving an AUC of 85.1% and an accuracy of 80.7% in multigraph classification. In addition, we compare linear machine learning methods and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed HODAB model. Specifically, we identified the most relevant subnetworks and cognitive regions that are negatively influenced by persistent marijuana use, revealing that chronic marijuana use adversely affects cognitive control, particularly within the Dorsal Attention and Frontoparietal networks, which are essential for attentional, cognitive, and higher cognitive functions. The results show that our proposed model is capable of accurately predicting craving maps and identifying brain maps associated with long-term cravings, and also pinpointing active areas that are important for analysis.</description>

      <title>Organic electrochemical neurons and synapses with ion mediated spiking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future brain-machine interfaces, prosthetics, and intelligent soft robotics will require integrating artificial neuromorphic devices with biological systems. Due to their poor biocompatibility, circuit complexity, low energy efficiency, and operating principles fundamentally different from the ion signal modulation of biology, traditional Silicon-based neuromorphic implementations have limited bio-integration potential. Here, we report the first organic electrochemical neurons (OECNs) with ion-modulated spiking, based on allprinted complementary organic electrochemical transistors. We demonstrate facile biointegration of OECNs with Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) to induce lobe closure upon input stimuli. The OECNs can also be integrated with all-printed organic electrochemical synapses (OECSs), exhibiting short-term plasticity with paired-pulse facilitation and longterm plasticity with retention &gt;1000 s, facilitating Hebbian learning. These soft and flexible OECNs operate below 0.6 V and respond to multiple stimuli, defining a new vista for localized artificial neuronal systems possible to integrate with bio-signaling systems of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates.</description>

      <title>Spiral wave dynamics in a neuronal network model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral waves are spatial-temporal patterns that can emerge in different systems as heart tissues, chemical oscillators, ecological networks and the brain. These waves have been identified in the neocortex of turtles, rats, and humans, particularly during sleep-like states. Although their functions in cognitive activities remain until now poorly understood, these patterns are related to cortical activity modulation and contribute to cortical processing. In this work, we construct a neuronal network layer based on the spatial distribution of pyramidal neurons. Our main goal is to investigate how local connectivity and coupling strength are associated with the emergence of spiral waves. Therefore, we propose a trustworthy method capable of detecting different wave patterns, based on local and global phase order parameters. As a result, we find that the range of connection radius (R) plays a crucial role in the appearance of spiral waves. For R &lt; 20 {\mu}m, only asynchronous activity is observed due to small number of connections. The coupling strength (gsyn ) greatly influences the pattern transitions for higher R, where spikes and bursts firing patterns can be observed in spiral and non-spiral waves. Finally, we show that for some values of R and gsyn bistable states of wave patterns are obtained.</description>

      <title>Identification of Novel Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder Through Convolutional Neural Network-Based Analysis of Functional, Structural, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data Towards Enhanced Autism Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder is one of the leading neurodevelopmental disorders in our world, present in over 1% of the population and rapidly increasing in prevalence, yet the condition lacks a robust, objective, and efficient diagnostic. Clinical diagnostic criteria rely on subjective behavioral assessments, which are prone to misdiagnosis as they face limitations in terms of their heterogeneity, specificity, and biases. This study proposes a novel convolutional neural network-based classification tool that aims to identify the potential of different neuroimaging features as autism biomarkers. The model is constructed using a set of sequential layers specifically designed to extract relevant features from brain imaging data. Trained and tested on over 300,000 distinct features across three imaging types, the model shows promise in classifying individuals with autism from typical controls, outperforming metrics of current gold standard diagnostics by achieving an accuracy of 95.4% on a dataset of 1,111 samples with 521 autistic subjects (260 male and 261 female) and 590 controls (297 male and 293 female). 32 optimal features from the training data were identified and classified as candidate biomarkers using an independent samples t-test, in which functional features such as connectivity and the time series of signal intensity from each voxel exhibited the highest mean value differences between individuals with autism and typical control subjects. The p-values of these biomarkers were &lt; 0.001, proving the statistical significance of the results and indicating that this research could pave the way towards the usage of neuroimaging in conjunction with behavioral criteria in clinics.</description>

      <title>Metacognition is all you need? Using Introspection in Generative Agents to Improve Goal-directed Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in various applications, yet LLMs face challenges such as limited context windows and difficulties in generalization. In this paper, we introduce a metacognition module for generative agents, enabling them to observe their own thought processes and actions. This metacognitive approach, designed to emulate System 1 and System 2 cognitive processes, allows agents to significantly enhance their performance by modifying their strategy. We tested the metacognition module on a variety of scenarios, including a situation where generative agents must survive a zombie apocalypse, and observe that our system outperform others, while agents adapt and improve their strategies to complete tasks over time.</description>

      <title>Neurological disorders leading to mechanical dysfunction of the esophagus: an emergent behavior of a neuromechanical dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An understanding how neurological disorders lead to mechanical dysfunction of the esophagus requires knowledge of the neural circuit of the enteric nervous system. Historically, this has been elusive. Here, we present an empirically guided neural circuit for the esophagus. It has a chain of unidirectionally coupled relaxation oscillators, receiving excitatory signals from stretch receptors along the esophagus. The resulting neuromechanical model reveals complex patterns and behaviors that emerge from interacting components in the system. A wide variety of clinically observed normal and abnormal esophageal responses to distension are successfully predicted. Specifically, repetitive antegrade contractions (RACs) are conclusively shown to emerge from the coupled neuromechanical dynamics in response to sustained volumetric distension. Normal RACs are shown to have a robust balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and the mechanical input through stretch receptors. When this balance is affected, contraction patterns akin to motility disorders are observed. For example, clinically observed repetitive retrograde contractions emerge due to a hyper stretch sensitive wall. Such neuromechanical insights could be crucial to eventually develop targeted pharmacological interventions.</description>

      <title>Abrupt and spontaneous strategy switches emerge in simple regularised neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11351v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans sometimes have an insight that leads to a sudden and drastic performance improvement on the task they are working on. Sudden strategy adaptations are often linked to insights, considered to be a unique aspect of human cognition tied to complex processes such as creativity or meta-cognitive reasoning. Here, we take a learning perspective and ask whether insight-like behaviour can occur in simple artificial neural networks, even when the models only learn to form input-output associations through gradual gradient descent. We compared learning dynamics in humans and regularised neural networks in a perceptual decision task that included a hidden regularity to solve the task more efficiently. Our results show that only some humans discover this regularity, whose behaviour was marked by a sudden and abrupt strategy switch that reflects an aha-moment. Notably, we find that simple neural networks with a gradual learning rule and a constant learning rate closely mimicked behavioural characteristics of human insight-like switches, exhibiting delay of insight, suddenness and selective occurrence in only some networks. Analyses of network architectures and learning dynamics revealed that insight-like behaviour crucially depended on a regularised gating mechanism and noise added to gradient updates, which allowed the networks to accumulate "silent knowledge" that is initially suppressed by regularised (attentional) gating. This suggests that insight-like behaviour can arise naturally from gradual learning in simple neural networks, where it reflects the combined influences of noise, gating and regularisation.</description>

      <title>The Machine Can't Replace the Human Heart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the true heart of mental healthcare -- innovation or humanity? Can virtual therapy ever replicate the profound human bonds where healing arises? As artificial intelligence and immersive technologies promise expanded access, safeguards must ensure technologies remain supplementary tools guided by providers' wisdom. Implementation requires nuance balancing efficiency and empathy. If conscious of ethical risks, perhaps AI could restore humanity by automating tasks, giving providers more time to listen. Yet no algorithm can replicate the seat of dignity within. We must ask ourselves: What future has people at its core? One where AI thoughtfully plays a collaborative role? Or where pursuit of progress leaves vulnerability behind? This commentary argues for a balanced approach thoughtfully integrating technology while retaining care's irreplaceable human essence, at the heart of this profoundly human profession. Ultimately, by nurturing innovation and humanity together, perhaps we reach new heights of empathy previously unimaginable.</description>
