      <title>Superluminal Propagation of Composite Collective Modes in Superconductor-Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions are paradigmatic systems for studying the delicate interplay of superconductivity and magnetism via proximity effects as well as their composite excitations. Here, we analyse the collective modes (CM) in such a heterostructure by taking into account the interplay between the de-magnetisation field $H_{dem}$ and the field caused by the anisotropy of the ferromagnet $H_{an}$, which was previously neglected. It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective modes, $\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of $H_{dem}&lt;H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}&gt;H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence $\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second case, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or weak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes demonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is superluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and complex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\it exception point}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske experiment, i.\,e.\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of magnetic field and voltage.</description>

      <title>Conventional s-wave superconductivity and hidden peak effect in single crystals of Mo$_8$Ga$_41$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: London and Campbell penetration depths were measured in single crystals of the endohedral gallide cluster superconductor, Mo$_{8}$Ga$_{41}$. The full temperature range superfluid density is consistent with the clean isotropic $s-$wave weak-coupling BCS theory without any signs of the second gap or strong coupling. The temperature dependence of the Campbell length is hysteretic between zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) protocols, indicating an anharmonic vortex pinning potential. The field dependence of the effective critical current density, $j_{c}\left(H\right)$, reveals an unusual result. While in the ZFC protocol, $j_{c}\left(H\right)$ is monotonically suppressed by the magnetic field, it exhibits a profound ``hidden'' peak effect in the FC protocol, that is, without a vortex density gradient. We suggest a possible novel mechanism for the formation of the peak effect, which involves both static and dynamic aspects.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic inter-layer coupling in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ superconductors revealed by inelastic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ superconductors are commonly considered layered van der Waals materials with negligible inter-layer coupling. Here, using inelastic neutron scattering to study spin excitations in single-crystal samples, we reveal that the magnetic coupling between adjacent Fe layers is not only significant, as it affects excitations up to \textcolor{black}{15} meV, but also ferromagnetic in nature, making the system different from most unconventional superconductors including iron pnictides. Our observation provides a new standpoint to understand the absence of magnetic order in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$. Since intercalating between the Fe layers is known to enhance superconductivity and suppress the inter-layer coupling, superconductivity appears to be a more robust phenomenon in the two-dimensional limit than antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Influence of capacitance and thermal fluctuations on the Josephson diode effect in asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric two-junction SQUIDs with different current-phase relations in the two Josephson junctions, involving higher Josephson harmonics, demonstrate a flux-tunable Josephson diode effect (asymmetry between currents flowing in the opposite directions, which can be tuned by the magnetic flux through the interferometer loop). We theoretically investigate influence of junction capacitance and thermal fluctuations on performance of such Josephson diodes. Our main focus is on the "minimal model" with one junction in the SQUID loop possessing the sinusoidal current-phase relation and the other one featuring additional second harmonic. Capacitance generally weakens the diode effect in the resistive branch (R state) of the current-voltage characteristic (CVC) both in the absence and in the presence of external ac irradiation. At the same time, it leads to qualitatively new features of the Josephson diode effect such as asymmetry of the retrapping currents (which are a manifestation of hysteretic CVC). In particular, the limiting case of the single-sided hysteresis becomes accessible. In its turn, thermal fluctuations are known to lead to nonzero average voltages at any finite current, even below the critical value. We demonstrate that in the diode regime, the fluctuation-induced voltage can become strongly (exponentially) asymmetric. In addition, we find asymmetry of the switching currents arising both due to thermal activation and due to Josephson plasma resonances in the presence of ac irradiation.</description>

      <title>Bulk high-temperature superconductivity in the high-pressure tetragonal phase of bilayer La2PrNi2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) bilayer nickelate, La3Ni2O7, was recently found to show signatures of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) at pressures above 14 GPa. Subsequent investigations achieved zero resistance in single- and poly-crystalline samples under hydrostatic pressure conditions. Yet, obvious diamagnetic signals, the other hallmark of superconductors, are still lacking owing to the filamentary nature with low superconducting volume fraction. The presence of a novel "1313" polymorph and competing R-P phases obscured proper identification of the phase for HTSC. Thus, achieving bulk HTSC and identifying the phase at play are the most prominent tasks at present. Here, we address these issues in the praseodymium (Pr)-doped La2PrNi2O7 polycrystalline samples. We find that the substitutions of Pr for La effectively inhibits the intergrowth of different R-P phases, resulting in nearly pure bilayer structure. For La2PrNi2O7, pressure-induced orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition takes place at Pc ~ 11 GPa, above which HTSC emerges gradually upon further compression. The superconducting transition temperatures at 18-20 GPa reach Tconset = 82.5 K and Tczero = 60 K, which are the highest values among known nickelate superconductors. More importantly, bulk HTSC was testified by detecting clear diamagnetic signals below ~75 K corresponding to an estimated superconducting volume fraction ~ 57(5)% at 20 GPa. Our results not only resolve the existing controversies but also illuminate directions for exploring bulk HTSC in the bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Unconventional Rashba Band and Vortex Zero Mode in Topopogical Superconductor Candidate AuSn$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05798v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode (MZM) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy AuSn$_{4}$ has been identified as an intrinsic surface TSC. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and MZM remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of AuSn$_{4}$, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an MZM in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and MZM in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity up to 14.2 K in MnB$_4$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in 3$d$-transition metal compounds with strong magnetism is interesting but rare. Especially for Mn-based compounds, there exist only very limited materials that show superconductivity. Here, we report the discovery of superconductivity up to 14.2 K in a Mn-based material MnB$_4$. By applying high pressures, we found the continuous suppression of a weak insulating behavior and the occurrence of superconductivity after about 30 GPa. With further increasing pressure, $T_\text{c}$ is gradually enhanced and reaches the maximum value of about 14.2 K at 150 GPa with a Fermi-Liquid behavior in the normal states. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveal the unchanged monoclinic (S.G: $P2_1/c$) symmetry but an unusual crossover of the lattice parameters $b$ and $c$. Theoretical calculations based on the electron-phonon coupling picture reveal a very low $T_\text{c}$ (less than 1 K), manifesting an exotic pairing mechanism beyond the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Our findings show a promising way to explore high $T_\text{c}$ superconductivity by combining the 3d-transition metal magnetic elements and light elements.</description>

      <title>Entanglement marker for lifetime of time crystal in transmon-modulated open Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in a qubit ensemble, periodically driven by its interaction with either a photon or a transmon field, which is prone to dissipative leakage. We find this DTC to be robust against changes in detuning and anharmonicity of the field mode. Additionally, we study the system in the semiclassical limit, where mean-field approximations are valid, and demonstrate the utility of a suitable semiclassical Hamiltonian for this purpose. Intriguingly, we observe that the system exhibits a transient DTC even with only two qubits. We examine the dynamics of bipartite entanglement between the qubits and the field. Our findings show that the entanglement saturates to a steady value early in the dynamics, following a sudden peak. We find a strong positive correlation between this long-term entanglement value and the lifetime of the transient DTC, in a wide range of the parameter regime where the field is due to a lossy photon or a lossy transmon mode, with small detuning.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid on the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by accounting for the correct superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In literature, the vorticity manifests itself incompletely as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation in the relevant expansion scheme, together with field redefinitions. Those discarded components are critical to restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, and the restoration incapsulates these two systems in the same master Lagrangian. In addition to clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism permits solving the bosonic system on the lowest Landau level (LLL) based on the method of analogue. In particular, we show that in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical by reformulating the vortex crystal with an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified view for these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductors are an exciting class of quantum materials from the point of view of the fundamental sciences and potential technological applications. Here, we report on the successful introduction of superconductivity in a ferromagnetic layered skyrmion system Cr$_3$Te$_4$, obtained by the Sn intercalation, below a transition temperature of $T_c$$\approx$3.5 K. We observe several interesting physical properties, such as superconductivity, magnetism, and the topological Hall effect, simultaneously in this system. Despite the magnetism and Meissner effects being anisotropic, the superconductivity observed from the in-plane electrical resistivity ($\rho_{\it{bc}}$) is nearly isotropic between $H\parallel \it{bc}$ and $H\parallel \it{a}$, suggesting separate channels of conduction electrons responsible for the superconductivity and magnetism of this system, which is also supported by our spin-resolved DFT calculations. We identify two orders of higher carrier density in superconducting Sn$_{0.06}$Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$ than the parent Cr$_3$Te$_4$. A jump in the specific heat is noticed around the $T_c$ with a volume fraction of 33\%, confirming the bulk superconductivity in Sn$_{0.06}$Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$. In addition to the introduction of superconductivity, tuning of topological Hall properties is noticed with Sn intercalation. Our observation of superconductivity in a skyrmion lattice brings up a new class of topological quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials have become an established platform to engineer flat bands which can lead to strongly-correlated emergent phenomena. In particular, the family of Ta dichalcogenides in the 1\textit{T} phase presents a star-of-David charge density wave that creates a flat band at the Fermi level. For TaS$_2$ and TaSe$_2$ this flat band is at half filling leading to a magnetic insulating phase. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that ligand substitution in the TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_x$ system produces a transition from the magnetic insulator to a non-magnetic metal in which the flat band gets doped away from half-filling. For $x\in[{0.846},{1.231}]$ the spin-polarized flat band is self-doped and the system becomes a magnetic metal. In this regime, we show that attractive interactions promote three different spin-triplet superconducting phases as a function of $x$, corresponding to a nodal f-wave and two topologically-different chiral p-wave superconducting phases. Our results establish monolayer TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_{x}$ as a promising platform for correlated flat band physics leading to unconventional superconducting states.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity at 80 K under high pressure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ presents the groundbreaking confirmation that high-$T_c$ superconductivity is a property of strongly correlated materials beyond cuprates. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the band structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure to verify that the low-energy bands are composed almost exclusively of Ni 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O 2$p$ orbitals. We deduce that the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals are essentially decoupled by the geometry of the high-pressure structure and by the effect of the Ni Hund coupling being strongly suppressed, which results from the enhanced interlayer antiferromagnetic interaction between $d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the strong intralayer hybridization of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals with O 2$p$. By introducing a tight-binding model for the Fermi surfaces and low-energy dispersions, we arrive at a bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$J$ model with strong interlayer hopping, which we show is a framework unifying La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with cuprate materials possessing similar band structures, particularly the compounds La$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_6$, Pb$_2$Sr$_2$YCu$_3$O$_8$, and EuSr$_2$Cu$_2$NbO$_8$. We use a renormalized mean-field theory to show that these systems should have ($d$+$is$)-wave superconductivity, with a dominant $d$-wave component and the high $T_c$ driven by the near-optimally doped $\beta$ band, while the $\alpha$ band adds an $s$-wave component that should lead to clear experimental signatures.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional $p$-wave altermagnet (AM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing symmetries. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are insensitive against varying the altermagnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic change as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a $p$-wave AM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing symmetries of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of AM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

Using the symmetries in a fine-tuned limit of the system, we identify the strong-coupling ground states and their fate when the perturbations caused by finite bandwidth, displacement field, and the phase of the intralayer potential are taken into account. We classify the superconducting instabilities and, employing a spin-fermion-like model, study the superconducting instabilities in proximity to these insulating particle-hole orders. This reveals that only a neighboring intervalley coherent phase (with zero or finite wave vector) is naturally consistent with the observed superconducting state. Depending on details, the superconductor will be nodal or a chiral gapped state while further including electron-phonon coupling leads to a fully gapped, time-reversal symmetric pairing state.</description>

Abstract: Multi-orbital electronic models hosting a non-trivial band-topology in the regime of strong electronic interactions are an ideal playground for exploring a host of complex phenomenology. We consider here a sign-problem-free and time-reversal symmetric model with isolated topological (chern) bands involving both spin and valley degrees of freedom in the presence of a class of repulsive electronic interactions. Using a combination of numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo computations and analytical field-theoretic considerations we analyze the phase-diagram as a function of the flat-band filling, temperature and relative interaction strength. The low-energy physics is described in terms of a set of intertwined orders -- a spin-valley hall (SVH) insulator and a spin-singlet superconductor (SC). Our low-temperature phase diagram can be understood in terms of an effective SO(4) pseudo-spin non-linear sigma model. Our work paves the way for building more refined and minimal models of realistic materials, including moir\'e systems, to study the universal aspects of competing insulating phases and superconductivity in the presence of non-trivial band-topology.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo study of stripes as a function of doping in the $t-t'$ Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform variational Monte Carlo simulations of the single-band Hubbard model on the square lattice with both nearest ($t$) and next-nearest ($t'$) neighbor hoppings. Our work investigates the consequences of increasing hole doping on the instauration of stripes and the behavior of the superconducting order parameter, with a discussion on how the two phenomena affect each other. We consider two different values of the next-nearest neighbor hopping parameter, that are appropriate for describing cuprate superconductors. We observe that stripes are the optimal state in a wide doping range; the stripe wavelength reduces at increasing doping, until stripes melt into a uniform state for large values of doping. Superconducting pair-pair correlations, indicating the presence of superconductivity, are always suppressed in the presence of stripes. Our results suggest that the phase diagram for the single-band Hubbard model is dominated by stripes, with superconductivity being possible only in a narrow doping range between striped states and a nonsuperconducting metal.</description>

      <title>A Variational Improvement of the Hartree-Fock Approach to the 2D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a refinement of the usual Hartree-Fock method applied to the 2D Hubbard model, in Nambu spinor formulation. The new element is the addition of a "condensate inducing" term proportional to a variational parameter h to the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which generates an s- or d-wave condensate at zero temperature. This modified Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is used only to generate variational trial states; energy expectation values are computed in the full two-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian with no modification. It is found that there exist trial states with non-vanishing condensates which are lower in energy than the standard Hartree-Fock ground states. However, these lower energy condensate states exist only in a spatially inhomogeneous (stripe) phase. No lowering of energy, relative to the Hartree-Fock ground state, is found in the spatially homogenous region of the U-density phase plane.</description>
