      <title>Benchmark: Tao's symplectic integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A benchmark test was conducted for a new symplectic integration method developed by Molei Tao. The method raises interest due to its explicit evolution equation, with applicability to both separable and non-separable Hamiltonian systems, and an easy-to-implement, easily generalizable algorithm. In order to compare the method with other, more well-known methods, namely St\"{o}rmer-Verlet and Runge-Kutta, we conducted a series of benchmark tests comparing their performance in terms of CPU time, system invariants functions conservation, and numerical symplectic area conservation. Overall, it was found that despite being slower than the more optimized Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp, Tao's method presents a similar performance to St\"{o}rmer-Verlet, with the extra perk of being more generic and not requiring the use of implicit equations for the evolution of the equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Feigenbaum universality in subcritical Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feigenbaum universality is shown to occur in subcritical shear flows. Our testing ground is the counter-rotation regime of the Taylor-Couette flow, where numerical calculations are performed within a small periodic domain. The accurate computation of up to the seventh period doubling bifurcation, assisted by a purposely defined Poincar\'e section, has enabled the estimation of the two Feigenbaum universal constants with unprecedented accuracy in a fluid flow problem. We have further devised a method to predict the bifurcation diagram up to the accumulation point of the cascade based on the detailed inspection of just the first few period doubling bifurcations. Remarkably, the method is applicable beyond the accumulation point, with predictions remaining valid, in a statistical sense, for the chaotic dynamics that follows.</description>

      <title>Interplay between two mechanisms of resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanisms of resistivity can be divided into two basic classes: one is dissipative (like scattering on phonons) and another is quasi-elastic (like scattering on static impurities). They are often treated by the empirical Matthiessen rule, which says that total resistivity is just the sum of these two contributions, which are computed separately. This is quite misleading for two reasons. First, the two mechanisms are generally correlated. Second, computing the elastic resistivity alone masks the fundamental fact that the linear-response approximation has a vanishing validity interval at vanishing dissipation. Limits of zero electric field and zero dissipation do not commute for the simple reason that one needs to absorb the Joule heat quadratic in the applied field. Here, we present a simple model that illustrates these two points. The model also illuminates the role of variational principles for non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff sum convergence of Fr\'echet observables to stable laws for Gibbs-Markov systems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a Poisson point process approach to prove distributional convergence to a stable law for non square-integrable observables $\phi: [0,1]\to R$, mostly of the form $\phi (x) = d(x,x_0)^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}$,$0&lt;\alpha\le 2$, on Gibbs-Markov maps. A key result is to verify a standard mixing condition, which ensures that large values of the observable dominate the time-series, in the range $1&lt;\alpha \le 2$. Stable limit laws for observables on dynamical systems have been established in two settings: ``good observables'' (typically H\"older) on slowly mixing non-uniformly hyperbolic systems and ``bad'' observables (unbounded with fat tails) on fast mixing dynamical systems. As an application we investigate the interplay between these two effects in a class of intermittent-type maps.</description>
