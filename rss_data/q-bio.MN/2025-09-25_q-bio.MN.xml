      <title>Meta-analysis and Topological Perturbation in Interactomic Network for Anti-opioid Addiction Drug Repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Speciffcally, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic datasets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yield 1,865 high-conffdence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular ffngerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding afffnity proffles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) proffling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

      <title>Dynamicasome: a molecular dynamics-guided and AI-driven pathogenicity prediction catalogue for all genetic mutations</title>

Abstract: Advances in genomic medicine accelerate the identi cation of mutations in disease-associated genes, but the pathogenicity of many mutations remains unknown, hindering their use in diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Predictive AI models are generated to combat this issue, but current tools display low accuracy when tested against functionally validated datasets. We show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.</description>
