      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points, occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum ${\bf M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta ${\bf D}^+$ and ${\bf D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either ${\bf D}^+$ or ${\bf D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>The majorant method for the fermionic effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling Polchinski's equation by the solution of an associate Hamilton-Jacobi equation which determines a norm majorant for the fermionic effective action. This method, referred to as the Majorant Method, was first introduced by D. Brydges and J. Wright in 1988, but its original formulation contains a gap which has never been addressed. We overcome this gap and show that the majorant equation and its existence condition are analogous to the ones originally obtained by Brydges and Wright. As an application of the method, we investigate systems with quartic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Positive Energy Representations of the Group of Compactly Supported Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by asymptotic symmetry groups in general relativity, we consider projective unitary representations $(\overline{\rho}, \mathcal{H})$ of the Lie group $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)$ of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold $M$ that satisfy a so-called generalized positive energy condition. In particular, this captures representations that are in a suitable sense compatible with a KMS state on the von Neumann algebra generated by $\overline{\rho}$. We show that if $M$ is connected and $\dim(M) &gt; 1$, then any such representation is necessarily trivial on the identity component $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)_0$. As an intermediate step towards this result, we determine the continuous second Lie algebra cohomology $H^2_{\mathrm{ct}}(\mathcal{X}_c(M), \mathbb{R})$ of the Lie algebra of compactly supported vector fields (which is subtly different from Gelfand--Fuks cohomology).</description>

      <title>Perturbative Construction of Equilibrium States for Interacting Fermionic Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to extend to interacting massive and massless fermionic theories the recent perturbative construction of equilibrium states developed within the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. We analyze the case of interactions which depend on time by a smooth switch-on function and on space by a suitably bounded function that multiplies an interaction Lagrangian density constructed with the field of the theory. The construction is achieved by first considering the case of compact support and, in a second step, by removing the space cutoff with a suitable limit (adiabatic limit). As an application, we consider a Dirac field interacting with a classical stationary background electromagnetic potential, and we compute at first perturbative order (linear response) the expectation value of the conserved current on the equilibrium state for the interacting theory. The resulting expectation value is written as a convolution, in the space coordinates, between the electromagnetic potential and an integral kernel which, at vanishing conjugate momentum, gives the inverse of the square Debye screening length at finite temperature. The corresponding Debye screening effect is visible in the backreaction treated semiclassically of this current on the classical background electromagnetic potential sourced by a classical external current.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic eigenvalues are known to satisfy analogs of several classic eigenvalue inequalities. Of these is a set of weak supermajorization relations concerning symplectic eigenvalues that are weaker analogs of some majorization relations corresponding to eigenvalues. The aim of this letter is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the saturation of the symplectic weak supermajorization relations by majorization.</description>

      <title>Late-time asymptotics of small data solutions for the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the precise late-time asymptotic behaviour of small data solutions for the Vlasov-Poisson system in dimension three. First, we show that the spatial density and the force field satisfy asymptotic self-similar polyhomogeneous expansions. Moreover, we obtain an enhanced modified scattering result for this non-linear system. We show that the distribution function converges, with an arbitrary rate, to a regular distribution function along high order modifications to the characteristics of the linearised problem. We exploit a hierarchy of asymptotic conservation laws for the distribution function. As an application, we show late-time tails for the spatial density and the force field, where the coefficients in the tails are obtained in terms of the scattering state. Finally, we prove that the distribution function (up to normalisation) converges weakly to a Dirac mass on the zero velocity set.</description>

      <title>Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By examining the characteristics of a rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensate through the perspective of large spin, we uncover a novel kind of topological point defect in the magnetization texture. These defects are predicted not by the conventional homotopy group analysis but by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The spin texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice carries doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid is found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity concentrates exclusively within defect points, forming an unconventional "unvortex" lattice. Numerical results are presented, which are in agreement with the aforementioned predictions.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the problem of studing the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky made a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. For higher moments, if one thinks of the ``overlap'' between two subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, as the size of their intersection $j$, then an ultrametric ansatz leads to rigorous lower bounds for the higher moments. For the 3rd moment, the replica symmetric ansatz leads to a complete elliptic integral for the generating function, following a method similar to the diagonal method of Furstenberg, Hautus and Klarner.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired activation functions in the convolutional neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the significant advantages offered by quantum computing, research in quantum machine learning has increased in recent years. While quantum speed-up has been demonstrated in some applications of quantum machine learning, a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanisms for improved performance remains elusive. Our study fills this gap by examining the expressibility of quantum circuits integrated within a convolutional neural network (CNN). Through numerical training on the MNIST dataset, our hybrid quantum-classical CNN model exhibited superior feature selection capabilities and significantly reduced the required training steps compared to the classical CNN. To understand the root of this enhanced performance, we conducted an analytical investigation of the functional expressibility of quantum circuits and derived a quantum activation function. We demonstrated that this quantum activation is more efficient in selecting important features and discarding unimportant information of input images. These findings not only deepen our comprehension of quantum-enhanced machine-learning models but also advance the classical machine-learning technique by introducing the quantum-inspired activation function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baumgratz, Cramer and Plenio established a rigorous framework (BCP framework) for quantifying the coherence of quantum states [\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.140401}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140401 (2014)}]. In BCP framework, a quantum state is called incoherent if it is diagonal in the fixed orthonormal basis, and a coherence measure should satisfy some conditions. For a fixed orthonormal basis, if a quantum state $\rho $ has nonzero imaginary part, then $\rho $ must be coherent. How to quantitatively characterize this fact? In this work, we show that any coherence measure $C$ in BCP framework has the property $C(\rho )-C($Re$\rho )\geq 0$ if $C$ is invariant under state complex conjugation, i.e., $C(\rho )=C(\rho ^{\ast })$, here $\rho ^{\ast }$ is the conjugate of $\rho ,$ Re$\rho $ is the real part of $\rho .$ If $C$ does not satisfy $C(\rho )=C(\rho ^{\ast }),$ we can define a new coherence measure $C^{\prime }(\rho )=\frac{1}{2}[C(\rho )+C(\rho ^{\ast })]$ such that $C^{\prime }(\rho )=C^{\prime }(\rho ^{\ast }).$ We also establish some similar results for bosonic Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: I. Generalized Gibbs Phase Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase diagrams are essential tools of the materials scientist, showing which phases are at equilibrium under a set of applied thermodynamic conditions. Essentially all phase diagrams today are two dimensional, typically constructed with axes of temperature-pressure or temperature-composition. For many modern materials, it would be valuable to construct phase diagrams that include additional forms of thermodynamic work--such as elastic, surface, electromagnetic or electrochemical work, etc.--which grows the free energy of materials into higher (&gt;3) dimensions. Here, we extend Gibbs' original arguments on phase coexistence to derive a generalized Phase Rule, based in the combinatorial geometry of high-dimensional convex polytopes. The generalized Phase Rule offers a conceptual and geometric foundation to describe phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams, which are relevant for understanding the stability of modern materials in complex chemical environments.
  We revisit Gibbs arguments on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances and show that phase coexistence regions in high-dimensional Internal Energy space, U(S,Xi,...,Xj), are simplicial convex polytopes--which are N-dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedra. In the first of this three-part series, we examine how the combinatorial relationships between the vertices and facets of simplicial polytopes leads to a generalized high-dimensional description of Gibbs' Phase Rule. Because Gibbs' Phase Rule describes the nature of phase boundaries on phase diagrams, this isomorphism between the physical principles of equilibrium thermodynamics and the geometry of simplicial polytopes provides the foundation to construct generalized phase diagrams, which can exist in any dimension, with any intensive or extensive thermodynamic variable on the axes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dubrovin has shown that the spectrum of the quantization (with respect to the first Poisson structure) of the dispersionless Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) hierarchy is given by shifted symmetric functions; the latter are related by the Bloch-Okounkov Theorem to quasimodular forms on the full modular group. We extend the relation to quasimodular forms to the full quantum KdV hierarchy (and to the more general quantum Intermediate Long Wave hierarchy). These quantum integrable hierarchies have been defined by Buryak and Rossi in terms of the Double Ramification cycle in the moduli space of curves. The main tool and conceptual contribution of the paper is a general effective criterion for quasimodularity.</description>

      <title>Generalised eigenfunction expansion and singularity expansion methods for canonical time-domain wave scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalised eigenfunction expansion method (GEM) and the singularity expansion method (SEM) are applied to solve the canonical problem of wave scattering on an infinite stretched string in the time domain. The GEM, which is shown to be equivalent to d'Alembert's formula when no scatterer is present, is also derived in the case of a point-mass scatterer coupled to a spring. The discrete GEM, which generalises the discrete Fourier transform, is shown to reduce to matrix multiplication. The SEM, which is derived from the Fourier transform and the residue theorem, is also applied to solve the problem of scattering by the mass-spring system. The GEM and SEM are also applied to the problem of scattering by a mass positioned a fixed distance from an anchor point, which supports more complicated resonant behavior.</description>

      <title>Derivation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and quantum Boltzmann equations in an interacting Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous work [37] presented a rigorous derivation of quantum Boltzmann equations near a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we extend it with a complete characterization of the leading order fluctuation dynamics. For this purpose, we correct the latter via an appropriate Bogoliubov rotation, in partial analogy to the approach by Grillakis-Machedon et al. [59], in addition to the Weyl transformation applied in [37]. Based on the analysis of the third order expansion of the BEC wave function, and the second order expansions of the pair-correlations, we show that through a renormalization strategy, various contributions to the effective Hamiltonian can be iteratively eliminated by an appropriate choice of the Weyl and Bogoliubov transformations. This leads to a separation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations and quantum Boltzmann equations. A multitude of terms that were included in the error term in [37] are now identified as contributions to the HFB renormalization terms. Thereby, the error bound in the work at hand is improved significantly. To the given order, it is now sharp, and matches the order or magnitude expected from scaling considerations. Consequently, we extend the time of validity to $t\sim (\log N)^2$ compared to $t\sim (\log N/\log \log N)^2$ before. We expect our approach to be extensible to smaller orders in $\frac1N$.</description>

      <title>Frozen condition of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence as an important physical resource plays the key role in implementing various quantum tasks, whereas quantum coherence is often deteriorated due to the noise. In this paper, we analyse under which dynamical conditions the $l_1$-norm or the relative entropy of coherence can remain unchanged during the whole evolution (freezing coherence). For single qubit systems, a nice formula is given to realize freezing coherence. Conversely, for a $d\ (d&gt;2)$ dimensional system, we identify universal geometric conditions of freezing coherence. This offers an affirmative answer to the open question: how can one determine whether a unital quantum operation can be decomposed as a convex combination of unitary operations [M. A. Nielsen and I. L. Chuang, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2000)]. Based on this analysis, we also give a complete classification of coherent states from operational coherence theory. This builds the counterpart of entanglement classification under LOCC.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal Majorana zero modes, ELC waves and soliton-fermion duality in non-Hermitian $sl(2)$ affine Toda coupled to fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian (NH) $sl(2)$ affine Toda model coupled to fermions through soliton theory techniques and the realizations of the pseudo-chiral and pseudo-Hermitian symmetries. The interplay of non-Hermiticity, integrability, nonlinearity, and topology significantly influence the formation and behavior of a continuum of bound state modes (CBM) and extended waves in the localized continuum (ELC). The non-Hermitian soliton-fermion duality, the complex scalar field topological charges and winding numbers in the spectral topology are uncovered.
  The biorthogonal Majorana zero modes, dual to the NH Toda solitons with topological charges $\frac{2}{\pi} \arg{(z=\pm i)}=\pm 1$, appear at the complex-energy point gap and are pinned at zero energy. The zero eigenvalue $\l (z = \pm i)=0$, besides being a zero mode, plays the role of exceptional points (EPs), and each EP separates a real eigenvalue ${\cal A}$-symmetric and ${\cal A}$-symmetry broken regimes for an antilinear symmetry ${\cal A}\in \{ {\cal P}{\cal T}, \g_5{\cal P}{\cal T}\}$. Our findings improve the understanding of exotic quantum states, but also paves the way for future research in harnessing non-Hermitian phenomena for topological quantum computation, as well as the exploration of integrability and NH solitons in the theory of topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras for partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce families of quasi-rectifiable vector fields and study their geometric and algebraic aspects. Then, we analyse their applications to systems of partial differential equations. Our results explain, in a simpler manner, previous findings about hydrodynamic-type equations. Facts concerning families of quasi-rectifiable vector fields, their relation to Hamiltonian systems, and practical procedures for studying such families are developed. We introduce and analyse quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras, which are motivated by geometric and practical reasons. We classify different types of quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras, e.g. indecomposable ones up to dimension five. New methods for solving systems of hydrodynamic-type equations are established to illustrate our results. In particular, we study hydrodynamic-type systems admitting $k$-wave solutions through quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras of vector fields. We develop techniques for obtaining the submanifolds related to quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras of vector fields and systems of partial differential equations admitting a nonlinear superposition rule: the PDE Lie systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-degenerate parametric amplifier problem from an algebraic approach of the $SU(1,1)$ group. We write the Hamiltonian of this problem in terms of the boson generators of the $SU(1,1)$ group and the difference operator. We apply the tilting transformation to our results to exactly solve this Hamiltonian and obtain its energy spectrum and eigenfunctions. Then, by assuming that our Hamiltonian is an explicit function of time we calculate its Berry phase. Finally we obtain the Mandel $Q-$parameter of the photon numbers $n_a$ and $n_b$.</description>

      <title>The phase transition of the Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio in the abelian lattice Higgs model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio is a quantity used in the physics literature to differentiate between phases in lattice Higgs models. It is defined as the limit of a ratio of expectations of Wilson line observables as the length of these lines go to infinity while the parameters of the model are kept fixed. In this paper, we show that the Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio exists in all predicted phases of the model, and show that it indeed undergoes a phase transition. In the Higgs phase of the model we do a more careful analysis of the ratio to deduce its first order behaviour and also give an upper bound on its rate of convergence. Finally, we also present a short and concise proof of the exponential decay of correlations in the Higgs phase.</description>

      <title>Critical Casimir effect in a disordered $O(2)$-symmetric model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical Casimir effect appears when critical fluctuations of an order parameter interact with classical boundaries. We investigate this effect in the setting of a Landau-Ginzburg model with continuous symmetry in the presence of quenched disorder. The quenched free energy is written as an asymptotic series of moments of the models partition function. Our main result is that, in the presence of a strong disorder, Goldstone modes of the system contribute either with an attractive or with a repulsive force. This result was obtained using the distributional zeta-function method without relying on any particular ansatz in the functional space of the moments of the partition function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article, the first in a series, analyzes the general theory of plane wave spacetimes. Following Dmitri Aleekseevsky, these are defined as spacetimes admitting a group of dilations leaving invariant a smooth curve. If this curve is specified as part of the structure, the spacetime is termed a Penrose limit, whose theory was developed first by Roger Penrose. The main result is that every plane wave is a Rosen universe, a generalization of the smooth metrics of Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen, allowing for certain isolated co-ordinate singularities; the latter are characterized. We conclude with an extended example, using the techniques developed in the article to associate a vacuum plane wave in four dimensions to any hyperbolic billiard trajectory.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: II. The duality between closed and open chemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern materials are often synthesized or operated in complex chemical environments, where there can be numerous elemental species, competing phases, and reaction pathways. When analyzing reactions using the Gibbs free energy, which has a natural variable of composition, it is often cumbersome to solve for the equilibrium states of a complicated heterogeneous mixture of phases. However, if one is interested only in the stability of a single target material, it may be easier to reframe the boundary conditions around only the target material-of-interest, with boundary conditions open to chemical exchange with an external reservoir. The corresponding phase diagram would thus have a chemical potential axis for the open volatile species, rather than a composition axis. Here we discuss how to derive, compute, and interpret phase diagrams with chemical potential axes, which are dual to the more common composition phase diagram.
  In our ambition to construct high-dimensional phase diagrams featuring any thermodynamic variable on its axes, here we examine the duality between extensive and intensive conjugate variables in equilibrium thermodynamics. This duality manifests from the distinction between closed and open boundary conditions of a thermodynamic system, to the relationship between the Internal Energy and its Legendre transformations, to the point-line duality in calculating convex hulls versus half-space intersections. Here we focus on the duality relationships of chemical work, with extensive composition variables, N, and intensive chemical potentials, {\mu}. In particular, we explore mixed composition-chemical potential diagrams for oxynitride synthesis, lithium-ion cathode stability, and oxidation of high-entropy alloys. We further illustrate how chemical potential diagrams reveal the driving forces for non-equilibrium growth and dissolution kinetics.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: III. Engineering relative stability in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing thermodynamic conditions to improve (or reduce) the stability of a target material is a key task in materials engineering. For example, during materials synthesis one aims to enhance the stability of a target phase relative to its precursors or competing byproduct phases. If an undesired phase forms in experiment, one aims to destabilize the undesired phase by dissolution or corrosion. When multiple thermodynamic knobs are available to engineer relative stability, it can be difficult to navigate the corresponding high-dimensional phase diagram to identify optimal pathways to promote or destabilize a target phase. We propose that instead of mapping the absolute phase boundaries of a target material, we can invoke a generalized Clausius-Clapeyron relation, which provides a 'compass' to point out which directions on a high-dimensional phase diagram are best to stabilize or destabilize a target phase.
  Phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams are also high-dimensional objects, and can represent phase coexistence between numerous phases simultaneously. On a 2D temperature-pressure phase diagram, phase boundaries are 1D lines separating two phases, with a slope given by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, dP/dT = {\Delta}S/{\Delta}V. Here, we derive a parametric form of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation that readily scales to high-dimensional phase boundaries. The gradient of a phase boundary guides us on how to increase or decrease the relative stability of a target compound, meaning this generalized Clausius-Clapeyron relation enables us to engineer relative stability with respect to multiple thermodynamic conditions simultaneously. Using this approach, we analyze the acid stability of manganese oxide catalysts on a 4-dimensional Pourbaix diagram with axes of pH, redox potential, nanoparticle size, and aqueous [K+] ion concentration.</description>
