      <title>Well-posedness and invariant measures for complex valued modified KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one dimensional periodic complex valued mKdV, which corresponds to the first equation above cubic NLS in the associated integrable hierarchy. Our main result is the construction of a sequence of invariant measures supported on Sobolev spaces with increasing regularity. The fact that we work with complex valued functions makes the analysis of the invariance much harder compared to the real valued case, that can be handled instead following the ideas used by Zhidkov [73].</description>

      <title>The existence and uniqueness for the fractional advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the fractional diffusion equation
  $$\frac{\partial^\alpha u}{\partial t^{\alpha}} + K(-\Delta)^{\beta} u - \nabla \cdot (\nabla V u) = f$$
  on a $d$-dimensional torus, subject to sufficient conditions on the input parameters. The focus is on fractional orders $\alpha$ and $\beta$ less than 1. The strategy uses a Galerkin method and focuses on the additional complexity that comes from the fractional-order derivatives. Additional regularity of the solution is shown. The spectral approach to the existence proof suggests an algorithm to compute explicit solutions numerically. The regularity results are used to support a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed numerical scheme.</description>

      <title>Fourth order Saint-Venant inequalities: maximizing compliance and mean deflection among clamped plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a fourth order analogue of the Saint-Venant inequality: the mean deflection of a clamped plate under uniform transverse load is maximal for the ball, among plates of prescribed volume in any dimension of space. The method works in Euclidean space, hyperbolic space, and the sphere.
  Similar results for clamped plates under small compression and for the compliance under non-uniform loads are proved to hold in two dimensional Euclidean space, with the higher dimensional and curved cases of those problems left open.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to a compressible viscous non-resistive MHD equations with general boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a compressible MHD equations describing the evolution of viscous non-resistive fluids in piecewise regular bounded Lipschitz domains. Under the general inflow-outflow boundary conditions, we prove existence of global-in-time weak solutions with finite energy initial data. The present result extends considerably the previous work by Li and Sun [\emph{J. Differential Equations.}, 267 (2019), pp. 3827-3851], where the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition for velocity field is treated. The proof leans on the specific mathematical structure of equations and the recently developed theory of open fluid systems. Furthermore, we establish the weak-strong uniqueness principle, namely a weak solution coincides with the strong solution on the lifespan of the latter provided they emanate from the same initial and boundary data. This basic property is expected to be useful in the study of convergence of numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Zero modes and Dirac-(logarithmic) Sobolev-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay rate of the zero modes of the Dirac operator with a matrix-valued potential that is considered here without any regularity assumptions, compared to the existing literature. For the Dirac operator and for Clifford-valued functions we prove the $L^p$-$L^2$ Dirac Sobolev inequality with explicit constant, as well as the $L^p$-$L^q$ Dirac-Sobolev inequalities. We prove its logarithmic counterpart for $q=2$, extending it to its Gaussian version of Gross, as well as show Nash and Poincar\'e inequalities in this setting, with explicit values for constants.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic transonic shock solution in divergent nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that it is possible to control a normal transonic shock to move periodically by adjusting the boundary conditions at the entrance or the exit of the tube, for which, the phenomena has been observed in engineering. In this paper, we describe the gas by a quasi-one-dimensional compressible Euler equations with temporal periodic boundary conditions and prove the global existence and dynamical stability of the time-periodic transonic shock solution with an iteration method. The major difficulty is to determine the position of the moving shock front, which can be obtained by a free boundary problem in the subsonic domain. We decouple this free boundary problem by the $Rankine-Hugoniot$ conditions and a two-step iteration process.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and multiplicity of positive radial solutions to the super-critical Brezis-Nirenberg problem in an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super-critical Brezis-Nirenberg problem in an annulus is considered. The new uniqueness result of positive radial solutions is established for the three-dimensional case. It is also proved that the problem has at least three positive radial solutions when the inner radius of the annulus is sufficiently small and the outer inner radius of the annulus is in a certain range. Moreover, for each positive integer $k$, the problem has at least $k$ positive radial solutions when the exponent of the equation is greater than the critical Sobolev exponent and is less than the Joseph-Lundgren exponent.</description>

      <title>Spacetime decay of mild solutions and quantitative transfer of regularity of the incompressible Navier--Stokes Equations from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the "transfer of regularity" phenomenon for the incompressible Navier--Stokes Equations (NSE) in dimension $n \geq 3$; that is, the strong solutions of NSE on $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be nicely approximated by those on sufficiently large domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ under the no-slip boundary condition. Based on the space-time decay estimates of mild solutions of NSE established by [On space-time decay properties of nonstationary incompressible Navier-Stokes flows in $\mathbb{R}^n$, Funkcial. Ekvac. 43 (2000);$L^2$ decay for weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 88 (1985)] and others, we obtain quantitative estimates for the ``transfer of regularity'' on higher-order derivatives of velocity and pressure under the smallness assumptions of the Stokes' system and/or the initial velocity, thus complementing the results obtained by [Using periodic boundary conditions to approximate the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the transfer of regularity, Nonlinearity 34 (2021)] and [Quantitative transfer of regularity of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations from $\Bbb R^3$ to the case of a bounded domain, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 23 (2021)].</description>

      <title>On the decay of solutions for the negative fractional KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the limits of fractional dispersive effects and their incidence in the propagation of polynomial weights. More precisely, we consider the fractional KdV equation when a differential operator of negative order determines the dispersion. We investigate what magnitude of weights and conditions on the initial data that allow solutions of the equation to persist in weighted spaces. As a consequence of our results, it follows that even in the presence of negative dispersion, it is still possible to propagate weights whose maximum magnitude is related to the dispersion of the equation. We also observe that our results in weighted spaces do not follow specific properties and limits that their counterparts with positive dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong solvability of the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for parabolic quasilinear equations with discontinuous data. The principal coefficients depend on the point $(x,t)$ and on the solution u, the dependence on x is of VMO type while these are only measurable with respect to t. Assuming suitable structural conditions on the nonlinear terms, we prove existence and uniqueness of the strong solution, which turns out to be also Holder continuous.</description>

      <title>Processing the 2D and 3D Fresnel experimental databases via topological derivative methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents reconstructions of homogeneous targets from the 2D and 3D Fresnel databases by one-step imaging methods based on the computation of topological derivative and topological energy fields. The electromagnetic inverse scattering problem is recast as a constrained optimization problem, in which we seek to minimize the error when comparing experimental microwave measurements with computer-generated synthetic data for arbitrary targets by approximating a Maxwell forward model. The true targets are then characterized by combining the topological derivatives or energies of such shape functionals for all available receivers and emitters at different frequencies. Our approximations are comparable to the best approximations already obtained by other methods. However, these topological fields admit easy to evaluate closed-form expressions, which speeds up the process.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic derivation of the gradient flows associated to a broad class of interfacial energies, emphasizing the relation between intrinsic and extrinsic variations of the interface. We show that the intrinsic variables formulation brings the gradient flow into alignment with the traditional analysis of quasi-steady dynamical systems defined on a stationary domain. Gradient flows are derived for model systems which exhibit quasi-steady pattern formation including coarsening among faceted interfaces and nonlocal interactions that model membrane self-adhesion and self-avoidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a real-valued solution to the eigenvalue problem $-\text{div}(A\nabla u)=\lambda u$, $\lambda&gt;0,$ in the cylinder $\mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}$ with a real, uniformly elliptic, and uniformly $C^1$ matrix $A$ such that $|u(x,y,t)|\leq C e^{-c e^{c|t|}}$ for some $c,C&gt;0$. We also construct a complex-valued solution to the heat equation $u_t=\Delta u + B \nabla u$ in a half-cylinder with continuous and uniformly bounded $B$, which also decays with double exponential speed. Related classical ideas, used in the construction of counterexamples to the unique continuation by Plis and Miller, are reviewed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the singularities of potential energy functionals \(\phi(\cdot)\) associated with semiconcave functions \(\phi\) in the Borel probability measure space and their propagation properties. Our study covers two cases: when \(\phi\) is a semiconcave function and when \(u\) is a weak KAM solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation \(H(x, Du(x)) = c[0]\) on a smooth closed manifold. By applying previous work on Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space, we prove that the singularities of \(u(\cdot)\) will propagate globally when \(u\) is a weak KAM solution, and the dynamical cost function \(C^t\) is the associated fundamental solution. We also demonstrate the existence of solutions evolving along the cut locus, governed by an irregular Lagrangian semiflow on the cut locus of \(u\).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the blow-up of the $3$-D isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations for the adiabatic exponent $\gamma=5/3$, which corresponds to the law of monatomic gas. This is the degenerate case in the sense of [Merle, Rapha\"el, Rodnianski and Szeftel, Ann. of Math. (2), 196 (2022), 567-778; Ann. of Math. (2), 196 (2022), 779-889]. Motivated by breakthrough works [Merle, Rapha\"el, Rodnianski and Szeftel, Ann. of Math. (2), 196 (2022), 567-778; Ann. of Math. (2), 196 (2022), 779-889], we first prove the existence of a sequence of smooth, self-similar imploding solutions to the compressible Euler equations for $\gamma=5/3$, and then we use these self-similar profiles to construct smooth, asymptotically self-similar blow-up solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thin plates where out-of-plane deformations arise due to membrane kinematic incompatibility of rotational type, specifically Volterra wedge disclinations, which are commonly observed in metal plates and graphene. We present theorems that guarantee the existence and regularity of equilibrium solutions in the presence of a finite number of disclinations and a dead load, for clamped plates. To solve the equilibrium equations, we implement a numerical code in the FEniCS environment and apply it to a series of parametric test studies. Our Finite Element method follows the Discontinuous Galerkin approach with C0 elements.</description>

Abstract: Consider a second-order elliptic operator $L$ in the half-plane $\mathbb R \times (0, \infty)$ with coefficients depending only on the second coordinate. The Poisson kernel for $L$ is used in the representation of positive $L$-harmonic functions, that is, solutions of $L u = 0$. In probabilistic terms, the Poisson kernel is the density function of the distribution of the diffusion in $\mathbb R \times (0, \infty)$ with generator $L$ at the hitting time of the boundary. We prove that the Poisson kernel for $L$ is bell-shaped: its $n$th derivative changes sign $n$ times. In particular, it is unimodal and it has two inflection points (it is concave, then convex, then concave again).</description>

      <title>Sharp low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive novel sharp low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide sharp estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring--Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal H\"{o}lder regularity for solutions to Signorini-type obstacle problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of weak solutions to a class of obstacle problems, where the obstacle condition can be imposed on a subset of the domain. In particular, we establish the optimal H\"older regularity for Signorini-type problems, that is, the obstacle condition is imposed only on a subset of codimension one. For this purpose, we employ capacities, Alt--Caffarelli--Friedman-type and Almgren-type monotonicity formulae, and investigate an associated mixed boundary value problem. Further, we apply this problem to study classical obstacle problems for irregular obstacles.</description>

      <title>Volume growths versus Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study deals with fine volume growth estimates on metric measures spaces supporting various Sobolev-type inequalities. We first establish the sharp Nash inequality on Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and positive asymptotic volume ratio. The proof of the sharpness of this result provides a generic approach to establish a unified volume growth estimate whenever a wide range of Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev interpolation inequality holds on general, not necessarily smooth metric measure spaces without any curvature restriction. This result provides a partial answer to the question of Ledoux [Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse Math., 2000] in a broader setting, as it includes the usual Gagliardo-Nirenberg, Sobolev and Nash inequalities, as well as their borderlines, i.e., the logarithmic-Sobolev, Faber-Krahn, Morrey and Moser-Trudinger inequalities, respectively. As a first application, we prove sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev interpolation inequalities -- with their borderlines -- in the setting of metric measure spaces verifying the curvature-dimension condition ${\sf CD}(0,N)$ in the sense of Lott-Sturm-Villani. In addition, the equality cases are also characterized in terms of the $N$-volume cone structure of the ${\sf CD}(0,N)$ space together with the precise profile of extremizers. In addition, we also provide the heat kernel estimate with sharp constant on Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature, answering another question of Bakry, Concordet and Ledoux [ESAIM Probab. Statist., 1997].</description>

      <title>Uniqueness \&amp; Weak-BV Stability in the Large for Isothermal Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $1$-d isothermal Euler system, we consider the family of entropic BV solutions with possibly large, but finite, total variation. We show that these solutions are stable with respect to large perturbations in a class of weak solutions to the system which may not even be BV. The method is based on the construction of a modified front tracking algorithm, in which the theory of $a$-contraction with shifts for shocks is used as a building block. The main contribution is to construct the weight in the modified front tracking algorithm in a large-BV setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a Schauder-type estimate method, as developed in \cite{CHN}, to establish critical well-posedness result for the Fractional Fokker-Planck Equation. This equation serves as a fundamental model in kinetic theory and can be regarded as a semi-linear analogue of the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation. We demonstrate that the techniques introduced in this study are not only effective for the FFPE but also hold promise for broader applications, particularly in addressing the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation and the Landau equation. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the analytical framework required for these complex kinetic models.</description>

      <title>Spectral multipliers on two-step stratified Lie groups with degenerate group structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a sub-Laplacian on a two-step stratified Lie group $G$ of topological dimension $d$. We prove new $L^p$-spectral multiplier estimates under the sharp regularity condition $s&gt;d\left|1/p-1/2\right|$ in settings where the group structure of $G$ is degenerate, extending previously known results for the non-degenerate case. Our results include variants of the free two-step nilpotent group on three generators and Heisenberg-Reiter groups. The proof combines restriction type estimates with a detailed analysis of the sub-Riemannian geometry of $G$. A key novelty of our approach is the use of a refined spectral decomposition into caps on the unit sphere in the center of the Lie group.</description>

      <title>Structural stability of boundary layers in the entire subsonic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their physical importance, there are limited mathematical theories for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with strong boundary layers. This is mainly due to the absence of a stream function structure, unlike the extensively studied incompressible fluid dynamics in two dimensions. This paper aims to establish the structural stability of boundary layer profiles in the form of shear flow for the two-dimensional steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Our estimates are uniform across the entire subsonic regime, where the Mach number $m\in (0,1)$, allowing the zero Mach number limit to be directly justified in the presence of Prandtl boundary layers. The proof relies on the quasi-compressible-Stokes iteration introduced in [37], along with a subtle analysis of the interplay between density and velocity variables in different frequency regimes, and the identification of cancellations in higher-order estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex dynamic interactions between two typed populations coexisting within a shared space. We propose both theoretical and numerical study to analyze scenarios where one population (population $1$) must traverse a territory occupied by another (population $2$), necessitating strategies to mitigate overcrowding caused by spatial limitations. To capture these interactions, we model population $1$ using a linear transport equation, while population $2$ is described by a granular diffusion model a la sandpile to represent its internal dynamics and tendency to decongest. Through numerical simulations, we explore how different movement strategies of the traversing population (population $1$) - including directed motion towards a specific destination, internal dispersion to minimize crowding, and uniform dispersal across the space - affects the behavior of population $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by variational models for fracture, we provide a new proof of compactness for $GSBV^p$ functions without a priori bounds on the function itself. Our proof is based on the classical idea of concentration-compactness, making it transparent in strategy and simple in implementation. Further, so far as we are aware, this is the first time the connection to concentration-compactness has been made explicit for problems in fracture mechanics.</description>

      <title>The Mass-Angular Momentum Inequality for Multiple Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of two papers to establish the conjectured mass-angular momentum inequality for multiple black holes, modulo the extreme black hole 'no hair theorem'. More precisely it is shown that either there is a counterexample to black hole uniqueness, in the form of a regular axisymmetric stationary vacuum spacetime with an asymptotically flat end and multiple degenerate horizons which is 'ADM minimizing', or the following statement holds. Complete, simply connected, maximal initial data sets for the Einstein equations with multiple ends that are either asymptotically flat or asymptotically cylindrical, admit an ADM mass lower bound given by the square root of total angular momentum, under the assumption of nonnegative energy density and axisymmetry. Moreover, equality is achieved in the mass lower bound only for a constant time slice of an extreme Kerr spacetime. The proof is based on a novel flow of singular harmonic maps with hyperbolic plane target, under which the renormalized harmonic map energy is monotonically nonincreasing. Relevant properties of the flow are achieved through a refined asymptotic analysis of solutions to the harmonic map equations and their linearization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we demonstrate that a locally semiconvex viscosity supersolution to a possibly degenerate fully nonlinear elliptic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is differentiable along the directions spanned by the range of the coefficient associated with the second-order term. The proof leverages techniques from convex analysis combined with a contradiction argument. This result has significant implications for various stationary stochastic control problems. In the context of drift-control problems, it provides a pathway to construct a candidate optimal feedback control in the classical sense and establish a verification theorem. Furthermore, in optimal stopping and impulse control problems, when the second-order term is nondegenerate, the value function of the problem is shown to be differentiable.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an elementary proof of quantitative uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the Cucker--Smale model under sufficiently strong interaction. The idea is to combine existing finite-time propagation of chaos estimates with existing uniform-in-time stability estimates for the interacting particle system, in order to obtain a uniform-in-time propagation of chaos estimate with an explicit rate of convergence in the number of particles. This is achieved via a method that is similar in spirit to the classical 'stability + consistency implies convergence' approach in numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the bulk-edge correspondence principle for finite two-dimensional photonic structures. Specifically, we focus on the divergence-form operator with periodic coefficients and prove the equality between the well-known gap Chern number (the bulk invariant) and an edge index defined via a trace formula for the operator restricted to a finite domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the edge index characterizes the circulation of electromagnetic energy along the system's boundary and the BEC principle is a consequence of energy conservation. The proof leverages Green function techniques, which relax the smoothness requirements on the underlying structures and can be extended to other systems. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing robust topological photonic devices with finite geometries, complementing recent advancements in discrete models.</description>

      <title>Instability bands for periodic traveling waves in the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two families of periodic traveling waves exist in the focusing mKdV (modified Korteweg-de Vries) equation. Spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to co-periodic perturbations of the same period has been previously explored by using spectral analysis and variational formulation. By using tools of integrability such as a relation between squared eigenfunctions of the Lax pair and eigenfunctions of the linearized stability problem, we revisit the spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to perturbations of arbitrary periods. In agreement with previous works, we find that one family is spectrally stable for all parameter configurations, whereas the other family is spectrally unstable for all parameter configurations. We show that the onset of the co-periodic instability for the latter family changes the instability bands from figure-$8$ (crossing at the imaginary axis) into figure-$\infty$ (crossing at the real axis).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlocal derivative NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation describes modulations of waves in a stratified fluid and a continuous limit of the Calogero--Moser--Sutherland system of particles. For the defocusing version of this equation, we prove the linear stability of the nonzero constant background for decaying and periodic perturbations and the nonlinear stability for periodic perturbations. For the focusing version of this equation, we prove linear and nonlinear stability of the nonzero constant background under some restrictions. For both versions, we characterize the traveling periodic wave solutions by using Hirota's bilinear method, both on the nonzero and zero backgrounds. For each family of traveling periodic waves, we construct families of breathers which describe solitary waves moving across the stable background. A general breather solution with $N$ solitary waves propagating on the traveling periodic wave background is derived in a closed determinant form.</description>

      <title>Long- and short-time behavior of hypocoercive evolution equations via modal decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long- and short-time behavior of solutions to dissipative evolution equations is studied by applying the concept of hypocoercivity. Aiming at partial differential equations that allow for a modal decomposition, we compute estimates that are uniform with respect to all modes. While the special example of the kinetic Lorentz equation was treated in previous work of the authors, that analysis is generalized here to general evolution equations having a scaled family of generators.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of an unstable reaction-diffusion PDE with input delay despite state and input quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the global asymptotic stability problem of an unstable reaction-diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) subject to input delay and state quantization developing a switched predictor-feedback law. To deal with the input delay, we reformulate the problem as an actuated transport PDE coupled with the original reaction-diffusion PDE. Then, we design a quantized predictor-based feedback mechanism that employs a dynamic switching strategy to adjust the quantization range and error over time. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven properly combining backstepping with a small-gain approach and input-to-state stability techniques, for deriving estimates on solutions, despite the quantization effect and the system's instability. We also extend this result to the input quantization case.</description>

      <title>Equivariant constructions of spheres with Zoll families of minimal spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16032v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct one-parameter deformations of the Euclidean sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ inside $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that admit a Zoll family of codimension one embedded minimal spheres, in all dimensions $n\geq 3$. The method of construction is equivariant with respect to the natural actions of the orthogonal group. In particular, we show that the original Zoll spheres of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ have counterparts in the context of minimal surface theory, in all dimensions.
  We also describe the first examples of metrics on the real projective spaces $\mathbb{RP}^n$, in all dimensions $n \geq 3$, that admit a Zoll family of embedded minimal projective hyperplanes, and which are not isometric to metrics with minimal linear projective hyperplanes.
  The new constructions are underpinned by equivariant versions of Nash-Moser-Hamilton implicit function theorem, and yield new information even in dimension $n=2$. As an application, we also show that every finite group of the orthogonal group $O(3)$ that does not contain $-Id$ is the isometry group of some (classical) Zoll metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$.</description>

      <title>Degree of freedom count in linear gauge invariant PDE systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose a system of partial differential equations with constant coefficients describes a classical field theory. Einstein proposed a definition of the strength of such a theory and its degrees of freedom (DoF) based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the system. however, direct calculating the DoF is a nontrivial task. Here, we apply commutative algebra methods to this problem.
  We begin by interpreting the matrix of the system as a linear map between polynomial modules. First, we derive an explicit formula for the DoF as the multiplicity of a certain extension module. Second, we prove (for homogeneous and certain more general systems) another explicit formula for the DoF in terms of gauge symmetries and identities. A notable consequence of this formula is that two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF.</description>

      <title>Regularity for Minimizers of a Planar Partitioning Problem with Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the regularity of minimizers for a variant of the soap bubble cluster problem: \begin{align*}
  \min \sum_{\ell=0}^N c_{\ell} P( S_\ell)\,, \end{align*} where $c_\ell&gt;0$, among partitions $\{S_0,\dots,S_N,G\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfying $|G|\leq \delta$ and an area constraint on each $S_\ell$ for $1\leq \ell \leq N$. If $\delta&gt;0$, we prove that for any minimizer, each $\partial S_{\ell}$ is $C^{1,1}$ and consists of finitely many curves of constant curvature. Any such curve contained in $\partial S_{\ell} \cap \partial S_{m}$ or $\partial S_\ell \cap \partial G$ can only terminate at a point in $\partial G \cap \partial S_\ell \cap \partial S_{m}$ at which $G$ has a cusp. We also analyze a similar problem on the unit ball $B$ with a trace constraint instead of an area constraint and obtain analogous regularity up to $\partial B$. Finally, in the case of equal coefficients $c_\ell$, we completely characterize minimizers on the ball for small $\delta$: they are perturbations of minimizers for $\delta=0$ in which the triple junction singularities, including those possibly on $\partial B$, are ``wetted" by $G$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Poincar\'e compactification of the limiting planar semiflow of a coupled PDE-ODE system composed by a reaction-diffusion equation with large diffusion coupled with an ODE by a boundary condition in a heating transition region. The nonlinear sources are dissipative polynomials. We guarantee conditions to apply the Invariant Manifold Theorem in order to reduce the dimension of the PDE and we prove that the compactified vector fields are close in the $C^1$-norm.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: Which hyperbolic or elliptic PDEs admit functional separable solutions. We shall focus on the study of a sinh-Gordon type equation. We construct solutions to this equation via the method of functional separation. We prove that these are the only families that have the property of functional separation and so we obtain a classification. To this end, we construct new families of solutions for the hyperbolic and elliptic versions of both sine and sinh Gordon equations in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Maximal $L_1$-regularity of the Navier-Stokes equations with free boundary conditions via a generalized semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a new approach to show the maximal regularity theorem of the Stokes equations with free boundary conditions in the half-space $\mathbb R^d_+$, $d \ge 2$, within the $L_1$-in-time and $\mathcal B^s_{q, 1}$-in-space framework with $(q, s)$ satisfying $1 &lt; q &lt; \infty$ and $1 + 1 / q &lt; s &lt; 1 / q$, where $\mathcal B^s_{q, 1}$ stands for either homogeneous or inhomogeneous Besov spaces. In particular, we establish a generalized semigroup theory within an $L_1$-in-time and $\mathcal B^s_{q,1}$-in-space framework, which extends a classical $C_0$-analytic semigroup theory to the case of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. The maximal $L_1$-regularity theorem is proved by estimating the Fourier--Laplace inverse transform of the solution to the generalized Stokes resolvent problem with inhomogeneous boundary conditions, where density and interpolation arguments are used. The maximal $L_1$-regularity theorem is applied to show the unique existence of a local strong solution to the Navier--Stokes equations with free boundary conditions for arbitrary initial data $\boldsymbol a$ in $B^s_{q, 1} (\mathbb R^d_+)^d$, where $q$ and $s$ satisfy $d-1 &lt; q \le d$ and $-1+d/q &lt; s &lt; 1/q$, respectively. If we assume that the initial data $\boldsymbol a$ are small in $\dot B^{1 + d / q}_{q, 1} (\mathbb R^d_+)^d$, $d 1 &lt; q &lt; 2 d$, then the unique existence of a global strong solution to the system is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When used in bulk applications, mechanical metamaterials set forth a multiscale problem with many orders of magnitude in scale separation between the micro and macro scales. However, mechanical metamaterials fall outside conventional homogenization theory on account of the flexural, or bending, response of their members, including torsion. We show that homogenization theory, based on calculus of variations and notions of Gamma-convergence, can be extended to account for bending. The resulting homogenized metamaterials exhibit intrinsic generalized elasticity in the continuum limit. We illustrate these properties in specific examples including two-dimensional honeycomb and three-dimensional octet-truss metamaterials.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we approach the analysis of a degenerate nonlinear functional in one dimension, accommodating a degenerate weight $w$. Our investigation focuses on establishing an explicit relaxation formula for a functional exhibiting $p$-growth for $1&lt; p&lt;+\infty$. We adopt the approach developed in [6], where some assumptions like doubling or Muckenhoupt conditions are dropped. Our main tools consist of proving the validity of a weighted Poincar\'e inequality involving an auxiliary weight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into a comprehensive examination of the three-dimensional $(3D)$ incompressible magneto-hydrodynamic $(MHD)$ equations in $H^{1}(\R^{3})$. The modification involves incorporating a power term in the nonlinear convection component, a particularly relevant adjustment in porous media scenarios, especially when the fluid adheres to the Darcy-Forchheimer law instead of the conventional Darcy law. Our main contributions include establishing global existence over time and demonstrating the uniqueness of solutions. It is important to note that these achievements are obtained with smallness conditions on the initial data, but under the condition that $\beta &gt;3$ and $\alpha&gt;0$. However, when $\beta=3$, the problem is limited to the case $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{1}{2}$ as the above inequality is unsolvable for these values of $\alpha$ using our method. To support our statement, we will add a "slight disturbance" of the function f of the type $f(z)=log(e+z^{2})$ or $\log(\log(e^{e}+z^{2}))$ or even $\log(\log(\log((e^{e})^{e}+z^{2})))$.</description>

Abstract: Relying on a recent criterion, due to A.~Petrunin [18], to check if a complete, non-compact, Riemannian manifold admits an isometric embedding into a Euclidean space with positive reach, we extend to manifolds with such property the singular extension results of B.~Bulanyi and J.~Van~Schaftingen [5] for maps in the critical, nonlinear Sobolev space $W^{m/(m+1),m+1}\left(X^m,\mathcal{N}\right)$, where $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, $\mathcal{N}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $X^m$ is either the sphere $\mathbb{S}^m = \partial \mathbb{B}^{m+1}_+$, the plane $\mathbb{R}^m$, or again $\mathbb{S}^m$ but seen as the boundary sphere of the Poincar\'{e} ball model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$. As in [5], we obtain that the extended maps satisfy an exponential weak-type Sobolev-Marcinkiewicz estimate. Finally, we provide some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Lie Symmetry Net: Preserving Conservation Laws in Modelling Financial Market Dynamics via Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper employs a novel Lie symmetries-based framework to model the intrinsic symmetries within financial market. Specifically, we introduce Lie symmetry net (LSN), which characterises the Lie symmetries of the differential equations (DE) estimating financial market dynamics, such as the Black-Scholes equation. To simulate these differential equations in a symmetry-aware manner, LSN incorporates a Lie symmetry risk derived from the conservation laws associated with the Lie symmetry operators of the target differential equations. This risk measures how well the Lie symmetries are realised and guides the training of LSN under the structural risk minimisation framework. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that LSN effectively realises the Lie symmetries and achieves an error reduction of more than one order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LSN_code-5608/README.md.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the construction and usage of mimetic operators in curvilinear staggered grids. Specifically, we extend the Corbino-Castillo operators so they can be utilized to solve problems in non-trivial geometries. We prove that the resulting curvilinear operators satisfy the discrete analog of the extended Gauss-Divergence theorem. In addition, we demonstrate energy and mass conservation in curvilinear coordinates for the acoustic wave equation. These findings are illustrated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional elliptic/hyperbolic equations and can be extended to other partial differential equations as well.</description>

Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the unique locally perimeter minimizing partitioning of the plane into three regions, where one region has finite area and the other two have infinite measure, is given by the so-called standard lens partition. Here we prove a sharp stability inequality for the standard lens; hence strengthening the local minimality of the lens partition in a quantitative form. As an application of this stability result we consider a nonlocal perturbation of an isoperimetric problem.</description>

Abstract: We establish existence and uniqueness of minimax solutions for a fairly general class of path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations. In particular, the relevant Hamiltonians can contain the solution and they only need to be measurable with respect to time. We apply our results to optimal control problems of (delay) functional differential equations with cost functionals that have discount factors and with time-measurable data. Our main results are also crucial for our companion paper Bandini and Keller [arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.02147 (2024)], where non-local path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the stochastic optimal control of non-Markovian piecewise deterministic processes are studied.</description>

We obtain optimal local well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard in the critical Besov space $\mathbb{X}_p=\dot{B}_{p,1}^{\frac{d}{p}}\times \dot{B}_{p,1}^{-1+\frac{d}{p}}$ for $1\leq p&lt;2d$ with $d\geq2$. The main new result is the continuity of the solution maps from $\mathbb{X}_p$ to $C([0,T]: \mathbb{X}_p)$, which was not proved in previous works \cite{D2001, D2005, D2014}. To prove our results, we derive a new difference estimate in $L_t^1L_x^\infty$. Then we combine the method of frequency envelope (see \cite{Tao04}) but in the transport-parabolic setting and the Lagrangian approach for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations (see \cite{D2014}). As a by-product, the Lagrangian transform $(a,u)\to (\bar a, \bar u)=(a\circ X, u\circ X)$ used in \cite{D2014} is a continuous bijection and hence bridges the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically full measure sets of almost-periodic solutions for the NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of solutions for a family of nonlinear Schroedinger equations on the circle, with a smooth convolution potential and Gevrey regular initial data. Our main result is the construction of an asymptotically full measure set of small-amplitude time almost-periodic solutions, which are dense on invariant tori. In regions corresponding to positive actions, we prove that such maximal invariant tori are Banach manifolds, which provide a Cantor foliation of the phase space. As a consequence, we establish that, for many small initial data, the Gevrey norm of the solution remains approximately constant for all time and hence the elliptic fixed point at the origin is Lyapunov statistically stable. This is first result in KAM Theory for PDEs that regards the persistence of a large measure set of invariant tori and hence may be viewed as a strict extension to the infinite dimensional setting of the classical KAM theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the wave equation for the Laplace operator with potential, initial data, and nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. We establish a weak solution by using traces and extension domains. We also establish the existence, uniqueness and consistency of the very weak solution for the wave equation with singularities in the potential, initial data, source term, boundary and boundary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of self-generated directional cell migration on viscoelastic substrates in the absence of apparent intrinsic polarity. This model, first proposed in \cite{Clark}, was observed numerically to manifest traveling pulse solutions for sufficiently large collagen stiffness, leading to a persistent collective migration. Here we provide a rigorous mathematical framework for the model, finding the exact stationary states and conditional traveling pulse. We also prove global well-posed in $W^{k,\infty}$ spaces, local stability of the traveling pulse for high stiffness, and exponential convergence to the stationary state for low stiffness.</description>

      <title>Sloshing, Steklov and corners: Asymptotics of sloshing eigenvalues</title>

      <description>arXiv:1709.01891v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we develop an approach to obtain sharp spectral asymptotics for Steklov type problems on planar domains with corners. Our main focus is on the two-dimensional sloshing problem, which is a mixed Steklov-Neumann boundary value problem describing small vertical oscillations of an ideal fluid in a container or in a canal with a uniform cross-section. We prove a two-term asymptotic formula for sloshing eigenvalues. In particular, this confirms a conjecture posed by Fox and Kuttler in 1983. We also obtain similar eigenvalue asymptotics for other related mixed Steklov type problems, and discuss applications to the study of Steklov spectral asymptotics on polygons.</description>

      <title>The Selberg trace formula for spin Dirac operators on degenerating hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11793v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of the spin Dirac operator on families of hyperbolic surfaces where a set of disjoint simple geodesics shrink to $0$, under the hypothesis that the spin structure is non-trivial along each pinched geodesic. The main tool is a trace formula for the Dirac operator on finite area hyperbolic surfaces. We derive a version of Huber's theorem and a non-standard small-time heat trace asymptotic expansion for hyperbolic surfaces with cusps. As a corollary we find a simultaneous Weyl law for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator which is uniform in the degenerating parameter. The main result is the convergence of the Selberg zeta function associated to the Dirac operator on such families of hyperbolic surfaces. A central role is played by a $\{ \pm 1 \}$-valued class function $\varepsilon$ determined by the spin structure.</description>

      <title>On zero-background solitons of the sharp-line Maxwell-Bloch equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to systematically study general $N$-soliton solutions possibly containing multiple degenerate soliton groups (DSGs), in the context of the sharp-line Maxwell-Bloch equations with a zero background.We also show that results can be readily migrated to other integrable systems, with the same non-self-adjoint Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem or alike. Results for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the complex modified Korteweg-De Vries equation are obtained as explicit examples for demonstrative purposes. A DSG is a localized coherent nonlinear traveling-wave structure, comprised of inseparable solitons with identical velocities. Hence, DSGs are generalizations of single solitons (considered as $1$-DSGs), and form fundamental building blocks of solutions of many integrable systems. We provide an explicit formula for an $N$-DSG and its center. With the help of the Deift-Zhou's nonlinear steepest descent method, we prove the localization of DSGs, and calculate the long-time asymptotics for an arbitrary $N$-soliton solutions. It is shown that the solution becomes a linear combination of multiple DSGs in the distant past and future, with explicit formulae for the asymptotic phase shift for each DSG. Other generalizations of a single soliton are also discussed, such as $N$th-order solitons and soliton gases. We prove that every $N$th-order soliton can be obtained by fusion of eigenvalues of $N$-soliton solutions, with proper rescalings of norming constants, and demonstrate that soliton-gas solution can be considered as limits of $N$-soliton solutions as $N\to+\infty$.</description>

      <title>On local solubility of Bao--Ratiu equations on surfaces related to the geometry of diffeomorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the existence of asymptotic directions for the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of a closed 2-dimensional surface $(\Sigma,g)$ within the full diffeomorphism group, described by the Bao--Ratiu equations, a system of second-order PDEs introduced in [On a non-linear equation related to the geometry of the diffeomorphism group, Pacific J. Math. 158 (1993); On the geometric origin and the solvability of a degenerate Monge--Ampere equation, Proc. Symp. Pure Math. 54 (1993)]. It is known [The Bao--Ratiu equations on surfaces, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 449 (1995)] that asymptotic directions cannot exist globally on any $\Sigma$ with positive curvature. To complement this result, we prove that asymptotic directions always exist locally about a point $x_0 \in \Sigma$ in either of the following cases (where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature on $\Sigma$): (a), $K(x_0)&gt;0$; (b) $K(x_0)&lt;0$; or (c), $K$ changes sign cleanly at $x_0$, i.e., $K(x_0)=0$ and $\nabla K(x_0) \neq 0$. The key ingredient of the proof is the analysis following Han [On the isometric embedding of surfaces with Gauss curvature changing sign cleanly, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 58 (2005)] of a degenerate Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation -- which is of the elliptic, hyperbolic, and mixed types in cases (a), (b), and (c), respectively -- locally equivalent to the Bao--Ratiu equations.</description>

      <title>Deriving Perelman's Entropy from Colding's Monotonic Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his groundbreaking work from 2002, Perelman introduced two fundamental monotonic quantities: the reduced volume and the entropy. While the reduced volume was motivated by the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison applied to a suitably constructed $N$-space, which becomes Ricci-flat as $N\rightarrow \infty$, Perelman did not provide a corresponding explanation for the origin of the entropy. In this article, we demonstrate that Perelman's entropy emerges as the limit of Colding's monotonic volume for harmonic functions on Ricci-flat manifolds, when appropriately applied to Perelman's $N$-space.</description>

      <title>v-representability and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials in the one-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the ground-state density of any non-interacting Schr\"odinger operator on the one-dimensional torus with potentials in a certain class of distributions is strictly positive. This result together with recent results from [Sutter el al (2024), J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 475202] provides a complete characterization of the set of non-interacting v-representable densities on the torus. Moreover, we prove that, for said class of non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem holds, i.e., the external potential is uniquely determined by the ground-state density. In particular, the density-to-potential Kohn-Sham map is single-valued, and the non-interacting Lieb functional is differentiable at every point in this space of $v$-representable densities. These results contribute to establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the Kohn-Sham scheme in this simplified setting.</description>
