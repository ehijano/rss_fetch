      <title>Constrained many-body phases in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Higgs lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to soft-core bosonic matter at unit filling, inspired by the Higgs sector of the standard model. Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.</description>

      <title>Doubly charm tetraquark channel with isospin $1$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimentally, the doubly charm tetraquark channel $cc\bar q\bar q$ with $q\!=\!u,d$ features an exotic hadron, $T_{cc}$, with isospin $I\!=\!0$ near the $DD^*$ threshold, while no peak was observed for $I\!=\!1$. We present a lattice QCD study of this channel with $I\!=\!1$, $J^P\!=\!1^+$ and $m_\pi\simeq 280~$MeV. Finite-volume energies calculated across five charm quark masses consistently feature a positive energy shift with respect to non-interacting energies, indicating repulsive interaction at energies near threshold. These energies are used to compute the $DD^*$ scattering amplitude using both the standard L\"uscher method and the recently proposed effective-field-theory-based approach in the plane-wave basis, which incorporates the long-range interactions and the left-hand cut. Both analyses render a small negative scattering length and the scattering amplitude that does not feature any poles in the energy region near the $DD^*$ threshold, in line with LHCb results. We identify that the Wick contraction resembling $t$-channel isovector-vector meson exchanges between $D$ and $D^*$ plays a key role in distinguishing between the $I=0$ and $I=1$ channels, leading to repulsion in the $I=1$ and attraction in the $I=0$ channel.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Direct Monte Carlo computation of the 't~Hooft partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 't~Hooft partition function~$\mathcal{Z}_{\text{tH}}[E;B]$ of an $SU(N)$ gauge theory with the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry is defined as the Fourier transform of the partition function~$\mathcal{Z}[B]$ with respect to spatial-temporal components of the 't~Hooft flux~$B$. Its large volume behavior detects the quantum phase of the system. When the integrand of the functional integral is real-positive, the latter partition function~$\mathcal{Z}[B]$ can be numerically computed by a Monte Carlo simulation of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, just by counting the number of configurations of a specific 't~Hooft flux~$B$. We carry out this program for the $SU(2)$ pure Yang--Mills theory with the vanishing $\theta$-angle by employing a newly-developed hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm (the halfway HMC) for the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory. The numerical result clearly shows that all non-electric fluxes are ``light'' as expected in the ordinary confining phase with the monopole condensate. Invoking the Witten effect on~$\mathcal{Z}_{\text{tH}}[E;B]$, this also indicates the oblique confinement at~$\theta=2\pi$ with the dyon condensate.</description>

      <title>Eigenspectra of Minimally Doubled Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explored the eigenspectra of minimally doubled fermions, in both Karsten-Wilczek and Borici-Creutz realizations. We generated 4-dim $SU(3)$ gauge fields with a definite topological charge and calculated the chiralities of the eigenmodes for KW and BC fermions. We used the spectral flow of the eigenvalues for this purpose and demonstrated the Index theorem.</description>

      <title>Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.</description>

      <title>Electric Polarizability of Charged Kaons from Lattice QCD Four-Point Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electric polarizability of a charged kaon from four-point functions in lattice QCD as an alternative to the background field method. Lattice four-point correlation functions are constructed from quark and gluon fields to be used in Monte Carlo simulations. The elastic form factor (charge radius) is needed in the method which can be obtained from the same four-point functions at large current separations. Preliminary results from the connected quark-line diagrams are presented.</description>
