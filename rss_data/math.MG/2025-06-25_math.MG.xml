      <title>Cocycle superrigidity for median spaces of finite rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cocycle superrigidity in the setting of finite rank median spaces. By exploiting a dynamical approach to superrigidity, we establish, for a median space X of finite rank, the superrigidity of Isom(X)-valued cocycles for a product of locally compact second countable groups. In the case of action by irreducible lattices in such product groups, this approach yields a new and self-contained proof of the superrigidity of homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Reconstruction of Voronoi Generators in Large Tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Voronoi diagram partitions the plane into convex cells, each containing the points closest to a single generator. Given such a tessellation, the inverse Voronoi problem seeks the generator set \( S \) that produced it. Our algorithm selects a single interior cell with \( k \) edges and solves a compact, consistent linear system with \( 2(k+1) \) unknowns and \( 4k \) scalar equations to recover that cell's generator together with the \( k \) generators of its neighbors in one step. The remaining sites follow by successive geometric reflections. The overall running time is \( O(n) \) for a diagram with \( n \) cells. Across \( 10^3 \) Monte Carlo simulations on diagrams of \( 10^4 \) cells, the method achieved an average RMSE of \( 10^{-12} \) and a worst-case individual reconstruction error of \( 10^{-8} \), demonstrating both efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Fast repetitivity in non-rectifiable Delone sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of non-rectifiable, repetitive Delone sets in every Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. We further obtain a close to optimal repetitivity function for such sets. The proof is based on the process of encoding a non-realisable density in a Delone set, due to Burago and Kleiner.</description>

      <title>A new upper bound for mutually touching infinite cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ denote the maximum number of congruent infinite cylinders that can be arranged in $\mathbb{R}^3$ so that every pair of cylinders touches each other. Littlewood posed the question of whether $N=7$, which remains unsolved. In this paper, we prove that $N\leq 18$, improving the previously known upper bound of $24$ established by A. Bezdek.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the Plane with Four Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The translational tiling problem, dated back to Wang's domino problem in the 1960s, is one of the most representative undecidable problems in the field of discrete geometry and combinatorics. Ollinger initiated the study of the undecidability of translational tiling with a fixed number of tiles in 2009, and proved that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $11$ polyominoes is undecidable. The number of polyominoes needed to obtain undecidability was reduced from $11$ to $7$ by Yang and Zhang, and then to $5$ by Kim. We show that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $4$ (disconnected) polyominoes is undecidable in this paper.</description>

      <title>Sturmian lattices and Aperiodic tile sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices'', an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle.The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</description>

      <title>Expanders in Models of Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common model for social networks are Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs), in which vertices draw a random position in some latent geometric space, and the probability of two vertices forming an edge depends on their geometric distance. The geometry may be modelled in two ways: either two points are defined as close if they are similar in all dimensions, or they are defined as close if they are similar in some dimensions. The first option is mathematically more natural since it can be described by metrics. However, the second option is arguably the better model for social networks if the different dimensions represent features like profession, kinship, or interests. In such cases, nodes already form bonds if they align in some, but not all dimensions. For the first option, it is known that the resulting networks are poor expanders. We study the second option in the form of Minimum-Component Distance GIRGs, and find that those behave the opposite way for dimension $d\ge 2$, and that they have strong expanding properties. More precisely, for a suitable constant $C&gt;0$, the subgraph induced by vertices of (expected) degree at least $(\log n)^C$ forms an expander. Moreover, we study how the expansion factor of the resulting subgraph depends on the choice of $C$, and show that this expansion factor is $\omega(1)$ except for sets that already take up a constant fraction of the vertices. This has far-reaching consequences, since many algorithms and mixing processes are fast on expander graphs.</description>

      <title>The $m$th order Orlicz projection bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M_{n, m}(\mathbb{R})$ be the space of $n\times m$ real matrices. Define $\mathcal{K}_o^{n,m}$ as the set of convex compact subsets in $M_{n,m}(\mathbb{R})$ with nonempty interior containing the origin $o\in M_{n, m}(\mathbb{R})$, and $\mathcal{K}_{(o)}^{n,m}$ as the members of $\mathcal{K}_o^{n,m}$ containing $o$ in their interiors. Let $\Phi: M_{1, m}(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ be a convex function such that $\Phi(o)=0$ and $\Phi(z)+\Phi(-z)&gt;0$ for $z\neq o.$ In this paper, we propose the $m$th order Orlicz projection operator $\Pi_{\Phi}^m: \mathcal{K}_{(o)}^{n,1}\rightarrow \mathcal{K}_{(o)}^{n,m}$, and study its fundamental properties, including the continuity and affine invariance. We establish the related higher-order Orlicz-Petty projection inequality, which states that the volume of $\Pi_{\Phi}^{m, *}(K)$, the polar body of $\Pi_{\Phi}^{m}(K)$, is maximized at origin-symmetric ellipsoids among convex bodies with fixed volume. Furthermore, when $\Phi$ is strictly convex, we prove that the maximum is uniquely attained at origin-symmetric ellipsoids. Our proof is based on the classical Steiner symmetrization and its higher-order analogue.
  We also investigate the special case for $\Phi_{Q}=\phi\circ h_Q$, where $h_Q$ denotes the support function of $Q\in \mathcal{K}^{1, m}_o$ and $\phi: [0, \infty)\rightarrow [0, \infty)$ is a convex function such that $\phi(0)=0$ and $\phi$ is strictly increasing on $[0, \infty).$ We establish a higher-order Orlicz-Petty projection inequality related to $\Pi_{\Phi_Q}^{m, *} (K)$. Although $\Phi_Q$ may not be strictly convex, we characterize the equality under the additional assumption on $Q$ and $\phi$, such as $Q\in \mathcal{K}_{(o)}^{1,m}$ and the strict convexity of $\phi$.</description>

      <title>Skeletal Cut Loci on Convex Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a convex polyhedron P, the cut locus C(x) with respect to a point x is a tree of geodesic segments (shortest paths) on P that includes every vertex. We say that P has a skeletal cut locus if there is some x in P such that C(x) subset Sk(P), where Sk(P) is the 1-skeleton of P. At a first glance, there seems to be very little relation between the cut locus and the 1-skeleton, as the first one is an intrinsic geometry notion, and the second one specifies the combinatorics of P.
  In this paper we study skeletal cut loci, obtaining four main results. First, given any combinatorial tree T, there exists a convex polyhedron P and a point x in P with a cut locus that lies in Sk(P), and whose combinatorics match T. Second, any (non-degenerate) polyhedron P has at most a finite number of points x for which C(x) subset Sk(P). Third, we show that almost all polyhedra have no skeletal cut locus. Fourth, we provide a combinatorial restriction to the existence of skeletal cut loci.
  Because the source unfolding of P with respect to x is always a non-overlapping net for P, and because the boundary of the source unfolding is the (unfolded) cut locus, source unfoldings of polyhedra with skeletal cut loci are edge-unfoldings, and moreover "blooming," avoiding self-intersection during an unfolding process. We also explore partially skeletal cut loci, leading to partial edge-unfoldings; i.e., unfoldings obtained by cutting along some polyhedron edges and cutting some non-edges.</description>

      <title>Finite dimensionality of Besov spaces and potential-theoretic decomposition of metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of a metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$, we explore the potential-theoretic implications of having a finite-dimensional Besov space. We prove that if the dimension of the Besov space $B^\theta_{p,p}(X)$ is $k&gt;1$, then $X$ can be decomposed into $k$ number of irreducible components (Theorem 1.1). Note that $\theta$ may be bigger than $1$, as our framework includes fractals. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the dimension of the Besov space is $1$. We introduce critical exponents $\theta_p(X)$ and $\theta_p^{\ast}(X)$ for the Besov spaces. As examples illustrating Theorem 1.1, we compute these critical exponents for spaces $X$ formed by glueing copies of $n$-dimensional cubes, the Sierpi\'{n}ski gaskets, and of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet.</description>

Abstract: Periodic lattices are natural generalizations of lattices, which arise naturally in diophantine approximations with rationals of bounded denominators. In this paper, we prove analogues of classical theorems in geometry of numbers for periodic lattices in function fields. Moreover, we use special matrices to compute the covering and packing radii of special periodic lattices.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian correlation inequality for centered convex sets and the case of equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired from Milman's observation, we prove that the Gaussian correlation inequality holds for centered convex sets and characterize the case of equality. Furthermore, we confirm a nonsymmetric version of the inequality proposed by Szarek--Werner. The existing arguments due to Royen and Milman are seemingly difficult to be applied for these purposes since both of them involve certain approximation arguments that reduce the inequality to some weaker form. To overcome this difficulty, we generalize our previous work on the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hausdorff dimension of a set can be detected using the Riesz energy. Here, we consider situations where a sequence of points, $\{x_n\}$, ``fills in'' a set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ in an appropriate sense and investigate the degree to which the discrete analog to the Riesz energy of these sets can be used to bound the Hausdorff dimension of $E$. We also discuss applications to data science and Erd\H{o}s/Falconer type problems.</description>
