      <title>Quantum Data Learning of Topological-to-Ferromagnetic Phase Transitions in the 2+1D Toric Code Loop Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum data learning (QDL) provides a framework for extracting physical insights directly from quantum states, bypassing the need for any identification of the classical observable of the theory. A central challenge in many-body physics is that the identity of quantum phases, especially those with topological order, are often inaccessible through local observables or simple symmetry-breaking diagnostics. Here, we apply QDL techniques to the 2+1-dimensional toric-code loop-gas model in a magnetic field. Ground states are generated across multiple lattice sizes using a parametrized loop-gas circuit (PLGC) with a variational quantum-eigensolver (VQE) approach. We then train a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) across the full field-parameter range to perform phase classification and capture the overall phase structure. We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>First determination of fragmentation functions in an exotic-hadron candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there are experimental reports on exotic-hadron candidates, which have different quark configurations from ordinary $q\bar q$ and $qqq$ constituents. However, it is not easy to confirm their exotic nature from global observables such as masses, spins, parities, and decay widths. At high energies, internal quark and gluon configurations could become more apparent because hadrons should be described by fundamental degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics. One of such possibilities is to use the fragmentation functions (FFs). In this work, accurate FFs of an exotic hadron candidate $f_0$(980) are determined for the first time by an global analysis of experimental data on $e^+ + e^- \to f_0 (980)+X$ with recent precise measurements of the Belle collaboration. From the global analysis, we found that their second moments have a relation $M_u = M_d \ll M_s \sim M_g $ for up-quark, down-quark, strange-quark, and gluon FFs. Furthermore, the function $D_s^{f_0}(z)$ is distributed in the larger-$z$ region in comparison with the functions $D_{u}^{f_0}(z)$, $D_{d}^{f_0}(z)$, and $D_g^{f_0}(z)$. These facts support that the $f_0 (980)$ has the $s\bar s$ configuration at high energies. This is a new finding that $f_0 (980)$ should be considered mainly as the $s\bar s$ state, which is different from our usual understanding as a tetraquark (or $K\bar K$) hadron from low-energy studies. Our results could indicate the transition of the internal configuration picture that $f_0 (980)$ looks like a $q\bar q$ state at high energies although it is described by tetra-quark or $K\bar K$ molecule state at low energies. It sheds light on a new direction in exotic hadron physics.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Extracting GPDs from Exclusive Photon Electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new framework for studying generic $2 \to 3$ hard exclusive reactions, referred to as single-diffractive hard exclusive processes (SDHEP), has been introduced to provide a cleaner separation of the underlying physical mechanisms. In this work, we expand this formalism to the case of exclusive real-photon electroproduction off a nucleon, $e(\ell) + N(p) \to e(\ell') + N(p') + \gamma(q')$, which represents the classical channel for accessing generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in nucleons and nuclei. This extension enables a more systematic and physically transparent formulation of the reaction dynamics, paving the way for improved extractions of GPDs from experimental data as compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Precision thermodynamics of the strongly interacting Fermi gas in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-species cold atomic Fermi gas with attractive short-range interactions in two spatial dimensions undergoes a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) crossover as a function of $\ln (k_F a)$, where $a$ is the scattering length. However, the nature of this crossover in the strong coupling regime $\ln(k_F a) \sim 1$ remains poorly understood. In this work we use canonical-ensemble auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods on discrete lattices to calculate several thermodynamical quantities in the strongly interacting regime, and eliminate systematic errors by extrapolating to continuous time and taking the continuum limit. In particular, we present results for the condensate fraction, spin susceptibility, contact, energy equation of state, and the free energy staggering gap. We identify signatures of a pseudogap regime, in which pairing correlations survive above the critical temperature for superfluidity, in the spin susceptibility and in the free energy staggering gap. These results can be used as a benchmark for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Application of Laplace filters to the analysis of lattice time correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of lattice simulation correlation function data is notoriously hindered by the ill-conditioning of the Euclidean time covariance matrix. Additionally, the isolation of a single physical state in such functions is generally affected by systematic contamination from unwanted states. In this paper, we present a new methodology based on regulated Laplace filters and demonstrate that it can be used to address both issues using state-of-the-art simulation data. Regulated Laplace filters are invertible high-pass filters that suppress local correlations in the data, and we show that they can reduce the condition number of covariance matrices by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, Laplace filters can annihilate functions that decay exponentially with time, which can be used to alter the spectrum of a lattice correlation function. We show that this property can be exploited to significantly reduce excited-state contamination in the determination of matrix elements. The same property can also be used to constrain the spectral content of a correlation function and has the potential to form the basis of new methods to extract physical information from lattice data.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}^{(*)}$ Form Factors with the Heavy Quark Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent publications by three lattice QCD collaborations have provided an unprecedented wealth of theoretical predictions for the $\bar{B}_q \to D_q^{(*)}$ form factors, for spectator flavours $q=u/d$ and $q=s$. We analyse these predictions within the framework of the heavy-quark expansion (HQE) to order $\alpha_s$, $1/m_b$, and $1/m_c^2$. For the first time, our analysis imposes unitarity bounds for all of the $\bar{B}_q^{(*)} \to D_q^{(*)}$ form factors; this includes newly identified tensor form factors arising in $\bar{B}_q^*\to D_q^{(*)}$. This enables us to treat all form factors in the same fashion. At the level of our present analysis, the inclusion of the tensor bounds is not yet constraining the HQE parameter space. We find the lattice QCD results to be well compatible with each other in a joint HQE fit as well as with QCD sum rule estimates that were used in previous HQE analyses. This is in contrast to the strong variability of the posterior predictions, in particular of the form factors ratios $R_0$ and $R_2$. Using the posterior distributions of our HQE analysis, we provide predictions for angular observables and LFU ratios in the $\bar{B}_q \to D_q^{(*)}\ell^-\bar{\nu}$ decays.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Violation and large-$N_c$ spin-flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the contribution of the QCD $\bar \theta$ term to the CP violating pion-nucleon couplings and the nucleon electric dipole moment in a combined large-$N_c$ and chiral perturbation theory framework. In particular, we approach this issue through the emergent spin-flavor symmetry of the baryon sector at large but finite $N_c$. We obtain good agreement with previous analyses for the pion-nucleon couplings and show that the large-$N_c$ framework indicates that tree-level contributions to the electric dipole moment possibly play a dominant role. The spin-flavor symmetry also enables us to provide novel constraints on CP violating pion-$\Delta$ couplings as well as the $\Delta$ electric dipole moment and $\Delta N$ transition moment.</description>

      <title>Fully charm tetraquark production at hadronic collisions with gluon radiation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have performed, for the first time, a complete next-to-leading order QCD calculation for processes involving fully charm tetraquark states, revealing that the renormalization constant of the color-singlet four charm quark operator is exactly unity at this order. By resumming over various gluon radiation effects, we have improved the precision of their hadroproduction cross-section to the order of ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^5)$. Through symmetry analysis, we investigated the possible quark configurations of the fully charm tetraquark and expanded its states in the color symmetry-antisymmetry basis. By combining LHCb data on the total cross section of the exotic hadron X(6900) and CMS measurements of its spin-parity, we extracted the non-perturbative but universal long-distance matrix elements. The rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are also predicted, which await further experimental verification.</description>
