      <title>Extreme Sensitivity of Standard Model Vacuum Stability to Enhanced Scalar Couplings: Implications from Renormalization Group Equations and Radiatively Broken Electroweak Symmetry Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Standard Model vacuum stability exhibits extreme sensitivity to the Higgs quartic coupling: a mere 3\% enhancement represents the critical threshold separating metastability from absolute stability with UV Landau poles. Using three-loop renormalization group equations, we systematically investigate enhancement factors $k = \lambda_{\rm enhanced}/\lambda_{\rm SM}$ ranging from $k=1.0$ (Standard Model) to $k=7.2$ (radiative electroweak symmetry breaking prediction). We identify $k_{\rm crit} = 1.03$ as the marginal case where the coupling transitions from negative to positive evolution at high energies. For $k &gt; 1.03$, the theory exhibits absolute vacuum stability and develops UV poles at $\Lambda_{\rm UV} \sim 10^{16}$--$10^{18}$ GeV, signaling effective field theory breakdown and the onset of strong dynamics. The radiative symmetry breaking scenario with $k \approx 7.2$ falls deep in this regime, naturally connecting the electroweak scale to compositeness or other strong-coupling physics near the GUT scale. Our results reveal that the 125 GeV Higgs mass, lying near the metastability boundary, makes the scalar sector an exceptionally sensitive probe of beyond-Standard-Model physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Limits on Strong Dark Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We showcase cosmology's ability to constrain long-range forces between dark matter particles. Specifically, we consider a fermionic dark matter interacting via a Yukawa-coupled light scalar, focusing on regimes where the dark forces are stronger than gravitational and yet unconstrained. We show that the dark sector dynamics, both at the background and perturbation levels, is far richer than what can be captured with just the static interparticle Yukawa potential. The background dynamics includes an attractor that funnels a wide range of initial conditions onto an evolution unique to each parameter space. In a large swath of parameter space beyond existing limits, the dark sector deviates drastically from cold dark matter in observable epochs. We rule out this parameter space using existing constraints on dark-sector equation of state and small-scale cosmic perturbations, thus setting the strongest constraints yet on dark matter self-interactions at length scales shorter than 100 kpc. In addition, we briefly discuss repulsive dark forces and place cosmological limits that are stricter than in the attractive case.</description>

      <title>$L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge bosons in beam dumps and supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of a sub-GeV $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge boson. We find discrepancies with existing literature in sensitivity projections for the upcoming SHiP experiment and in the treatment of supernovae cooling constraints. We present a quantitative analysis of different production modes in beam dumps and compare our results to previous work. In the context of supernovae, we re-evaluate the standard supernova cooling bounds from SN1987A and analyze additional supernova-based probes: diffusive cooling, constraints from the existence of low-energy supernovae, and the absence of a high-energy neutrino signal from SN1987A.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter from the Edge of Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of bosonic dark matter candidates that we dub wallions, featuring boundaries in field space. The wallion mass is exponentially suppressed when the separation between boundaries far exceeds their intrinsic width and remains radiatively stable under self-interactions. We study the early-universe evolution of wallions and the associated cosmological signatures. Finally, we show that instanton effects can dynamically generate field-space boundaries and discuss possible experimental probes once the wallion couples to Standard Model fields.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Yang-Mills, and the Scattering Matrix as an SU(N)-equivariant Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-body scattering as an SU(N)-equivariant map acting on tensor-product representation spaces and analyze the entanglement generated by the $S$-matrix. This representation-theoretic perspective separates group structure from dynamics: the decomposition of $R\!\otimes\!R'$ fixes the invariant operator algebra and therefore the qualitative entangling power of the process. For particles in the fundamental representation, $\mathrm{End}_{\mathrm{SU}(N)}(N\!\otimes\!N)=\mathrm{Span}\{\mathbb{I},\mathbb{S}\}$, so only the identity and swap directions preserve separability, whereas generic combinations generate entanglement. Adjoint-adjoint scattering involves a larger invariant algebra involving $d$-tensors and is intrinsically entangling. In Yang-Mills theory one can use color-kinematics duality to show that the color kernel lies on a fixed ray of this operator space, yielding a universal maximum of the outgoing entanglement for scattering at right angles, $E_\star^{(2)}=\tfrac{3}{4}$ for $SU(2)$ and $E_\star^{(3)}\simeq0.91$, independent of kinematics. Dimension-six operators preserve this universality, while dimension-eight deformations populate new color sectors and shift $E_\star^{(N)}$, suggesting that entanglement in color space functions as a tomographic probe of effective operators. In helicity space, requiring maximally entangled inputs to scatter into maximally entangled outputs uniquely selects the Yang-Mills quartic coupling and enforces the color Jacobi identity, restating the on-shell Ward constraints as conditions on entanglement preservation. Our results suggest that the information-theoretic viewpoint unifies algebraic, geometric, and dynamical aspects of scattering.</description>

      <title>A new approach to determine the thermodynamics of deconfined matter to high accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that at finite density and sufficiently high temperatures, phase-quenched (PQ) lattice simulations combined with perturbation theory provide a new precision approach to determining the thermodynamics of QCD across a wide arc of the phase diagram where the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ remains small. In this regime, nonperturbative pairing effects in the PQ theory are parametrically suppressed, so that the difference between the PQ and full QCD pressures becomes a small perturbative correction. We compute this correction up to and including $O(\alpha_s^{7/2})$ using electrostatic QCD together with a novel numerical method to compute four-loop sum-integrals. This enables the determination of the perturbative QCD pressure with precision beyond the current state of the art while including nonperturbative pure-gluonic contributions from the lattice.</description>

      <title>Freezing-in the Axiverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of multiple light axions in the infrared is a generic feature of many ultraviolet (UV) scenarios. In many cases the number of axions ${\cal N}$ is ${\cal O}(10-100)$ or more. Even in the scenario where these axions interact very weakly with the Standard Model (SM), the presence of ${\cal N}$ light axions poses a challenge to the stringent constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. In order to remain agnostic about the UV, we adopt an effective field theory (EFT) approach, and parametrize the interactions of ${\cal N}$ axions with the SM to quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider operators up to dimension six, uncovering one previously-unconsidered charge radius operator, and pay particular attention to the flavor structure of the axion-SM fermion couplings and consider EFTs based on anarchy, textures, and minimal flavor violation. For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.</description>

      <title>Octet scalars shaping LHC distributions in 4-jet final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of a hypothetical scalar particle, $\Theta$, which is a color octet and an electroweak singlet. At hadron colliders, $\Theta$ is pair produced through its QCD coupling to gluons, so that its mass determines the cross section. It decays at tree level into $q\bar q$ through dimension-5 operators, and at one loop into gluons. Thus, the main LHC signature of $\Theta$ is a pair of dijets of equal invariant mass. The CMS search in this channel shows a $3.6\sigma$ excess over the QCD background for a dijet mass $M_{jj} \approx 0.95$ TeV, which can be due to $\Theta$: its production cross section (65 fb for a real scalar) and the acceptance of the CMS event selection applied to $p p \to \Theta \Theta \to \! (q \bar q)(q \bar q)$ yield a rate consistent with the excess. Furthermore, the shape of the $d\sigma/d M_{jj}$ signal is in agreement with the CMS result. Given the data-driven background fit performed by CMS, we find that a complex scalar fits better the data than a real scalar. Besides the pair of dijets, testable LHC signals include a trijet-dijet topology, a $t\bar t$ pair plus a dijet resonance, as well as final states involving a Higgs, $W$ or $Z$ boson plus jets.</description>

      <title>The Unresolved Behaviour of Polarized Scattering Matrix Elements at NNLO in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin asymmetries in collisions of spin-polarized hadrons probe polarized parton distributions, which encode the spin structure of the colliding hadrons. To perform precision physics studies with spin asymmetries, higher order QCD corrections to the underlying polarized cross sections are required. Their numerical implementation relies on the use of an infrared subtraction scheme, which extracts the infrared singular pieces from the real and virtual subprocesses. We derive the universal behaviour of longitudinally polarized real radiation matrix elements in their infrared-singular limits up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, thereby enabling the construction of infrared subtraction schemes for generic polarized cross sections at NNLO.</description>

      <title>CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP violation, which involves breaking the combined charge-conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetries, is essential for understanding the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. It is a key feature of the Standard Model, originating from complex phases in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix. Despite the successes of the SM, the amount of CP violation it predicts is not enough to explain baryogenesis, prompting searches for new sources of CP violation in other areas of particle physics. This article offers a pedagogical introduction to the theoretical foundations of C, P, and T symmetries and their combinations. It also emphasizes the importance of CP violation in modern particle physics and how it can be used to explore New Physics.</description>

      <title>Searching for screened scalar forces with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Screened scalars are ubiquitous in many dark-sector models. They give rise to non-trivial fifth forces whilst evading experimental constraints through density-dependent screening mechanisms. We propose equipping a 10\,m-scale long-baseline atom interferometer with an annular planar source mass inside the vacuum chamber to search for such screened fifth forces. Two key challenges arise: distinguishing the static fifth force from backgrounds, and isolating it from the plate's Newtonian gravity. We introduce the `$Q$-flip protocol', which alternates between interferometry sequences to induce controllable time-dependence, aiding signal extraction and de-trending of transient noise. We further develop an \emph{in situ} calibration procedure to characterise the plate's Newtonian gravity and reach shot-noise-limited sensitivity. We show that our proposal could test theoretically motivated parameter space, advancing existing bounds in chameleon and symmetron screened scalar models by $1$ to $1.5$ orders of magnitude. Our proposal is directly applicable to forthcoming experiments, such as AION-10 or VLBAI, and is readily extensible to broader theoretical models and longer baselines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the HL-LHC sensitivity to probe new invisible particles including scalars and fermions using semi-visible Higgs decays. The kinematics of these decays allow new particle masses below $m\lesssim 50$ GeV. We carry out our analysis within the framework of a dark-SMEFT effective theory with operators up to dimension six and a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the new particles are odd and the SM particles are even. We compare our results to those obtained from considering the invisible $Z$-width, as well as simple perturbative unitarity arguments. Finally, we outline kinematic strategies at the LHC to distinguish different operator structures of the postulated invisible particles.</description>

      <title>Beam polarization precision requirements for future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present work on quantifying the minimum requirements for beam polarization precision at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories. We find that, under the assumption of a high electron beam polarization ($P_-$) that the positron polarization ($P_+$) is of key importance but for reasons both known and newly discovered. We have discovered that improved positron polarization leads to a less strict requirement on the beam polarization precision for measurements that scale only with the effective polarization, $P_\mathrm{eff}$. Conversely, measurements that scale with the product of beam polarizations, $P_-P_+$, such as those that contain the $eeZ$ or $ee\gamma$ vertex, have their polarization precision demands get more strict as positron polarization increases. We check the polarization precision demands for $10^{-3}$ on the Higgsstrahlung cross-section ($\sigma_{ZH}$) at 250~GeV, $10^{-4}$ on the electron left-right asymmetry ($A_{\rm e}$) at the Z pole, and $10^{-4}$ on the di-photon cross-section ($\sigma_{\gamma \gamma}$) from the Z pole to 3~TeV. We find that, for measurements away from the Z pole, the goals can plausibly be attained if one can achieve precision on beam polarization better than $0.1\%$. For measurements of $A_{\rm e}$ at $10^{-4}$, colliders must do better than $0.02\%$ on beam polarization precision, or determine ways to upgrade their beam polarization values towards unity, where the requirements decrease to better than $0.15\%$.</description>

      <title>Sifting out the neutral and charged components of $X(3872)$ from a spin observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new method to detect the composition of the $X(3872)$ state. Based on a widely accepted interpretation that $X(3872)$ is a weakly bound $S$-wave molecule of the $D^{*0} \bar{D}^{0}$ (neutral) and $D^{*+} D^{-}$ (charged) configurations, the process $X(3872) \to \bar{D}^{*0} D^0$ is described by one-loop triangle diagrams with the corresponding components as intermediate particles, and with the parameters constrained by the experimental branching ratio. Unlike the mild behavior of the neutral component, the charged component manifests itself as a distinct structure near the $D^{*+} D^{-}$ threshold at $3.880$ GeV, in the $M_{\bar{D}^{*0} D^0}$ invariant mass distribution of the spin density matrix element $\rho^{D^*}_{00}$. Hence the line shape of $\rho^{D^*}_{00}$ near this structure depends sensitively on the proportions of the two configurations. We propose high-precision measurements of this matrix element by future BESIII and Belle experiments to elucidate how a molecular $X(3872)$ state is composed.</description>

      <title>Masses of Purely Top-Quark Bound States: Toponium and the Triply-Top Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudoscalar ($\eta_t$) and vector ($\psi_t$) toponium states, as well as the triply-top baryon ($\Omega_{ttt}$), using the QCD sum-rule method. This study was motivated by the recent observation of a pseudoscalar enhancement near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold, reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium align with the CMS prediction within the corresponding uncertainty range. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\bar{t}$ bound states. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.</description>

      <title>Trapped and Unstable: Axion-like particle fragmentation at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a resonant behavior in axion-trapped misalignment models featuring finite-temperature potential barriers. As the temperature decreases and the field is released from its trapped configuration, inhomogeneities are exponentially amplified through an instability in their equation of motion, leading to the fragmentation of the axion field. We show that this process constitutes a novel source of gravitational waves (GWs), analogous to those generated in zero-temperature axion fragmentation, but with distinct characteristics. We quantify the resulting GW spectrum, identifying the peak frequency and amplitude associated with the inhomogeneous axion dynamics. Our results indicate that the GW signal can be enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard fragmentation scenario, while exhibiting a markedly different spectral shape. The parameter space featuring both strong GW signals and reproducing the correct dark matter abundance is, however, limited.</description>

      <title>Boosting long lived particles searches at $\mu$TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prospects of the proposed $\mu$TRISTAN experiment, running in the energy asymmetric $\mu^+ e^-$ mode, in probing long lived particles (LLPs) arising from the decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson. We focus on the proposed runs with $\{E_{\mu^+}, E_{e^-}\} = \{1\,{\rm TeV},\,30\,{\rm GeV}\}$ and $\{E_{\mu^+}, E_{e^-}\} = \{3\,{\rm TeV},\,50\,{\rm GeV}\}$ and we show that, owing to the boosted nature of the produced events, a far detector placed along the beam line can collect a large fraction of the LLP flux. This allows one to set bounds on the exotic Higgs branching ratio which, for specific $\phi$ decay modes, can surpass those expected at the end of the High Luminosity LHC in the regime of large LLPs proper decay lengths. On the other hand, we find that the proposed strategy will not be able to further extend the limits that might be set by proposed LHC far detectors such as CODEX-b, ANUBIS and MATHUSLA.</description>

      <title>Possible $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{D}^*$ resonances by solving Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-pion exchange interaction between the kaon and the vector antikaon is investigated by solving the Schr\"odinger equation in the S-wave approximation. In addition to the particle $f_1(1285)$, another bound state of $K \bar{K}^*$ is obtained, which is approximately 9 MeV below the threshold of $K \bar{K}^*$ and labeled $f_1(1378)$ for convenience in this manuscript. Under the outgoing wave condition, two resonance states of $K \bar{K}^*$ are produced with different coupling constants fixed with the binding energies of $f_1(1285)$ and $f_1(1378)$, respectively. Both of the resonance states are located in the vicinity of 1400 MeV, and thus it is reasonable to assume that these two resonance states correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of the Particle Data Group simultaneously. This method is extended to study the $D \bar{D}^*$ system analogously. When the particle $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is treated as a bound state of $D \bar{D}^*$, the particles $T_{c\bar{c}1}(3900)$, $T_{c \bar{c}}(4020)$ and $X(3940)$ can be obtained as solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation under the outgoing wave condition, which implies the spin and parity of these particles are all $J^P=1^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy particle decays naturally realise informationally weak measurements of quantum spin. Decay kinematics act as continuous pointer variables whose overlapping angular distributions encode partial, non-projective information about the parent spin state. Ensemble averages of these pointers yield weak values, linking collider spin-density reconstruction to Aharonov-Vaidman measurement theory. This framework unifies spin tomography, entangled-decay correlations, and spin-correlation algorithms, showing that relativistic decays realise informationally weak measurements of spin and suggesting new ways to probe coherence and interference in high-energy processes.</description>

      <title>Probing thermal leptogenesis and dark matter through primordial gravitational waves from a supercooled universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological dynamics of a supercooled first-order phase transition in the classically conformal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model, where radiative symmetry breaking simultaneously generates the right-handed neutrino (RHN) masses, and a strong stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations.</description>

      <title>Primer of Strong-Field Quantum Electrodynamics for Experimentalists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document serves as a conceptual and practical introduction to Strong-Field Quantum Electrodynamics (SFQED), written from the standpoint of experimental physicists. It was developed in the context of the "Strong-Field QED Workshop 2024" at DESY, aimed at supporting early-career researchers entering the field from the experimental side. Rather than providing a comprehensive theoretical review, the document focuses on the core ideas, terminology, and challenges in SFQED that are most relevant to experimental design and interpretation. Our goal is to offer a first point of contact with the subject, bridging the gap between foundational theory and hands-on experimental work, and complementing more formal literature in the field.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like symmetry in Regge spectrum of light mesons: selection of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the $(L,n)$-classification of excited light non-strange mesons, where $L$ and $n$ are orbital and radial quantum numbers. The selection of true non-strange quark-antiquark excited states and assigning to them definite $L$ and $n$ is a notoriously confusing problem. Three guiding principles for selection of correct observed states are formulated. They are applied for construction of a new $(L,n)$-classification. This classification is consistent both with the approximate Regge form of the spectrum and with the hydrogen-like degeneracy, i.e., the dependence of mass on the sum $L+n$.</description>

      <title>Revealing di-pion correlations for the observed substructure near the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass threshold in $\psi(3686)\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the world's largest $\psi(3686)$ data sample, the BESIII Collaboration recently reported a substructure near the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass threshold in the decay $\psi(3686) \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$, challenging the established understanding of the di-pion invariant mass spectrum. We propose that this substructure arises directly from di-pion correlations. Using a chiral unitary approach, we successfully reproduce the observed anomaly, thereby providing strong evidence of di-pion correlation in heavy quarkonium decays. This approach also allows us to predict the corresponding di-pion correlation function.</description>

      <title>Updated branching ratios and $CP$ asymmetries in $D \to PV$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by extensive new high-precision experimental data, we present an updated analysis of the two-body charm decays $D \to PV$ (with $P =\pi,K, \eta^{(\prime)}$ and
  $V =\rho, K^*, \omega, \phi$) within the
  factorization-assisted topological-amplitude (FAT) approach. In the framework, flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking effect is incorporated into the topological amplitudes, allowing the nonfactorizable contributions from topological diagrams to be expressed as a minimal set of universal parameters determined through a global fit to experimental data. Thanks to the sufficient data with high precision, we are now able to quantify the nonfactorizable contribution of so-called ``factorization" $T$ diagram, which is essential for explaining the observed branching ratios. The parameters for the $C$, $E$, and $A$ diagrams are also updated with significant improved precision, and notably, the resulting strong phases differ substantially from those in the earlier FAT analysis. We find that the $C$ topological amplitude features substantial nonfactorizable effects in the charm sector. These refined parameters enable predictions of significantly improved accuracy, yielding branching ratios in good agreement with current data and the latest results in topological diagram approach, and the predicted direct $\mathit{CP}$ asymmetries differ distinctly form previous FAT results due to updated strong phases. In several modes, the $\mathit{CP}$ asymmetries are predicted to reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, thereby making them promising observables for future high-precision experiments at LHCb, BESIII and Belle II. Predictions for unobserved decay modes, especially those with branching fractions of order $10^{-4}\sim10^{-3}$, are also provided for forthcoming experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Bubble Friction in Symmetry-Restoring Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard (symmetry-breaking) first-order phase transitions, the frictional pressure on expanding bubble walls can be dominated by transition radiation -- the emission of a gauge boson with phase-dependent masses as particles present in the thermal plasma pass through bubble walls. This process is enhanced in the soft limit, and is known to produce a significant frictional effect that is proportional to the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ of the bubble wall, thereby prohibiting runaway behavior. We calculate the analogous pressure for phase transitions with symmetry restoration. In such transitions, we show that the pressure due to this process can be $\textit{negative}$, producing the opposite effect. However, when the Lorentz factor of the wall gets very large, the result approaches the same scaling as the standard scenarios. Therefore, phase transitions with symmetry restoration can feature an intermediate negative friction regime even in the presence of significant interactions with the plasma, and the bubble wall terminal Lorentz factor can be significantly larger (by more than an order of magnitude) than in the corresponding symmetry-breaking scenarios. This can carry important implications for various phenomenological applications, from gravitational waves to physics beyond-the-Standard-Model.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Non-Abelian Gauge and Goldstone Bosons in a U(2) Flavor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenological implications of the bosons associated with the $SU(2)_F$ subgroup in a simple and realistic $U(2)_F$ flavor model. While the PNGB of the $U(1)_F$ factor behaves as a standard QCD axion (an axiflavon) with suppressed flavor-violating couplings, the three degrees of freedom from $SU(2)_F$ have not been studied before. This work focuses on these states, considering both the case where $SU(2)_F$ is a global symmetry, yielding pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGBs), and the case where it is a gauge symmetry with a potentially small coupling, yielding a triplet of (possibly) light gauge bosons. In both scenarios, these new bosons naturally feature unsuppressed flavor-violating couplings to Standard Model fermions in the mass basis. We derive the resulting predictions for flavor-changing neutral currents and lepton flavor violation, including exotic decays of mesons and leptons. Our analysis shows that processes like $K \to \pi X$ and $\mu \to e X$ place the most stringent constraints, probing the flavor symmetry breaking scale $v_\phi$ up to $10^{11}-10^{12}$ GeV for light bosons, while heavier states are tested in $B$ and $\tau$ decays, as well as by $K-\bar K$ mixing and $\mu\to e \gamma$. We demonstrate that low-energy flavor experiments provide a powerful probe of this framework, capable of testing ultra-high symmetry breaking scales that surpass the limits set by astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Toward a Comprehensive Exploration of Flavored Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for the study of flavored dark matter models, combining relic density calculations with direct and indirect detection limits, collider constraints, and a global analysis of flavor observables based on SMEFT matching and renormalization-group evolution. The framework applies to scalar or fermionic dark matter, including both self-conjugate and non-self-conjugate cases. As a proof of principle, we analyze two scenarios with Majorana dark matter coupling to right-handed charged leptons and to right-handed down-type quarks, assuming a thermal freeze-out. In the leptophilic case, flavor-violating decays such as $\mu \to e \gamma$ dominate the constraints, while LHC searches still leave sizable parameter space. For quark couplings, direct detection bounds and meson mixing severely restrict the allowed couplings, favoring hierarchical flavor structures. The toolchain presented in this paper is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/lena-ra/Flavored-Dark-Matter).</description>

      <title>A Fast Earth-scattering Formalism for Light Dark Matter with Dark Photon Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Dark Matter (DM) is typically assumed to interact only very weakly with the particles of the Standard Model, many direct detection experiments are currently exploring regions of parameter space where DM can have a large scattering cross section. In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Baryon Asymmetry from Monopole-Axion Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism where the kinetic energy of a rotating axion can be dissipated by the interactions with dark magnetic monopoles. This mechanism leads to a framework where the QCD axion and dark monopoles account for the dark matter density, and the observed baryon asymmetry is generated through the rotating QCD axion via axiogenesis. The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field. The axion kinetic energy is dissipated by the transition, and thus the axion abundance is depleted to the observed dark matter abundance. We predict that the axion decay constant should be below $10^9$ GeV to explain the observed dark matter and baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Dirac Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles in local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently proposed Boltzmann local equilibrium Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles is generalized to the case of Fermi-Dirac statistics. The resulting formula ensures the correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and reproduces the generalized thermodynamic relations with spin that were obtained in earlier studies. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic currents constructed from the Fermi-Dirac Wigner function can be obtained as derivatives of a suitably defined generating function with respect to the Lagrange multipliers (temperature, hydrodynamic flow, and chemical potentials). The identified generating function also indicates that the underlying framework can be classified as a divergence-type theory.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: I. Resonant Conversions in Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixing between dark photons and visible photons leads to substantial anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background due to resonant conversions of visible photons into dark photons in baryonic matter found in dark matter halos. In this Letter, we forecast the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to this signal. We find that SKA could be the first experiment to discover dark photons with a mass between $10^{-13}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as small as $\sim 10^{-8}$ by cross-correlating their data with a low-redshift galaxy survey, potentially improving on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in $\epsilon$. This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: II. Resonant Conversions in the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second part in a pair of papers forecasting the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to dark photons, a highly motivated, simple extension of the Standard Model. Through a kinetic mixing term, visible photons from the cosmic microwave background can resonantly convert into dark photons, generating new temperature anisotropies in the sky. In this work, we detail the entire analysis pipeline that we use to compute SKA's sensitivity, focusing on resonant conversions that occur in the intergalactic medium. We also discuss the sensitivity of 21-cm experiments to dark photons. Our results show that both SKA in combination with galaxy surveys and 21-cm experiments could discover dark photons with masses between $5\times 10^{-15}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV, and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as low as $10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Heptagon Symbols at Five Loops and All-Loop Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the symbol bootstrap program for the seven-particle MHV and NMHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) based on the alphabet associated with the $E_6$ cluster algebra. After imposing integrability, cluster adjacency (or extended Steinmann), first- and last-entry conditions, the solution space is already highly restrictive: e.g. for MHV case there are exactly $1,1,2,3,4$ parity-invariant solutions for $L=1,2,\cdots, 5$, which automatically satisfy dihedral symmetry. Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <title>Composite Dissipation in Warm Inflation: Implications for the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm inflation is a well-motivated and generalized framework of inflation, describing a coupled inflaton-radiation bath. In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $\Upsilon(\phi, T) = C_1 \frac{T^3}{M_{\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \frac{T^3}{\phi^2}.$ The two terms in $\Upsilon$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters -- like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function -- on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories. This work highlights the potential of warm inflation with a composite dissipation coefficient to reconcile large-scale CMB measurements with small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on (Anti-)nuclei Production with Pion-Nucleus Femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions provide a unique environment for synthesizing both nuclei and antinuclei (such as $\bar{d}$ and $\overline{^4\text{He}}$) at temperatures ($k_BT\sim100$ MeV) nearly two orders of magnitude above their binding energies of a few MeV. The underlying production mechanism, whether through statistical hadronization, nucleon coalescence, or dynamical regeneration and disintegration, remains unsettled. By solving relativistic kinetic equations for pion-catalyzed reactions for deuteron regeneration and disintegration ($\pi NN \leftrightarrow \pi d$) in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, we find pronounced peaks in the femtoscopic momentum correlations of both $\pi^+-p$ and $\pi^+-d$ pairs. These peak structures originate from the formation of intermediate $\Delta$ (1232) resonances, and their magnitudes agree with recent ALICE measurements when a downward in-medium $\Delta$ mass shift of about 70 MeV/$c^2$ is included. In contrast, the nucleon coalescence model reproduces only about half of the observed peak strength, and the statistical hadronization model predicts no resonance feature. These findings from pion-nucleus femtoscopy provide compelling evidence that pion-catalyzed reactions play a dominant role in the production of light (anti-)nuclei in high-energy nuclear collisions and cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Emulation of Proton-Deuteron Scattering via the Reduced Basis Method and Active Learning: Detailed Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon-deuteron ($Nd$) scattering can be used to constrain three-nucleon forces in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT). However, high-fidelity calculations, such as the Hyperspherical Harmonic (HH) method, are computationally expensive, making it difficult or even prohibitive to explore the vast parameter space of $\chi$EFT\xspace. To address this challenge, specifically for proton-deuteron ($pd$) scattering below the deuteron breakup threshold, we developed model-driven emulators based on the Reduced Basis Method (RBM) and active learning techniques, as presented in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01844}{arXiv:2511.01844}. The method exploits the similarities between solutions at different parameter points to significantly reduce computational costs. In this companion paper, we provide a comprehensive description of our HH-based high-fidelity calculations and implementation of both variational-method-based and Galerkin-projection-based scattering emulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning in the form of greedy algorithms for selecting optimal training points in the parameter space, and the high accuracy and speed of the emulators, for two different nucleon forces and two scattering channels (${1/2}^+$ and ${1/2}^-$). For example, in a two-dimensional parameter space, the relative emulation errors can be reduced to $10^{-7}$ with fewer than 10 training points. Our work paves the way for the efficient calibration of $\chi$EFT\xspace nucleon interactions using Bayesian statistics, and the methodology can be applied to other nuclear scattering processes (including neutron-deuteron scattering), as well as other finite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Friction terms in multi-fluid description of heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-fluid description of heavy-ion collisions, the primary scatterings and particle production are described in terms of interaction between fluids, so called friction. These friction terms can be derived from kinetic theory, but they are not unique. We compare different approaches to derive the friction terms, introduce a new ``charge transfer" friction, which allows to move charge to the midrapidity fireball, and implement them in the MUFFIN model. The charge transfer friction is more consistent with the assumption of three fluids clearly separated in momentum space, and allows better comparisons of the experimental data and underlying equation of state. It also leaves room for entropy generation due to dissipation in individual fluids, and we present the first results obtained using viscous multi-fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A new multiprobe analysis of modified gravity and evolving dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $(w_0, \, w_a)$ parametrization of the dark energy (DE) equation of state, with and without the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE) framework to describe the DE perturbations, parametrized here by the braiding parameter $\alpha_B$ and the running of the Planck mass $\alpha_M$. We combine the EFTofLSS full-shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of BOSS data with the tomographic angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$, $C_\ell^{\kappa g}$, $C_\ell^{Tg}$ and $C_\ell^{T\kappa}$, where $g$, $\kappa$ and $T$ stand for the DESI luminous red galaxy map, Planck PR4 lensing map and Planck PR4 temperature map, respectively. To analyze these angular power spectra, we go beyond the Limber approximation, allowing us to include large-scales data in $C_\ell^{gg}$. The combination of all these probes with Planck PR4, DESI DR2 BAO and DES Y5 improves the constraint on the 2D posterior distribution of $\{w_0, \, w_a\}$ by $\sim 50 \%$ and increases the preference for evolving dark energy over $\Lambda$ from $3.8 \sigma$ to $4.6 \sigma$. When we remove BAO and supernovae data, we obtain a hint for evolving dark energy at $2.3 \sigma$. Regarding the EFTofDE parameters, we improve the constraints on $\alpha_B$ and $\alpha_M$ by $\sim 40 \%$ and $50 \%$ respectively, finding results compatible with general relativity at $\sim 2 \sigma$. We show that these constraints do not depend on the choice of the BAO and supernovae likelihoods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.06595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interferences are not positive-definite and can change sign over the phase space. If the contributions of the regions where they are positive and negative nearly cancel each other, their effects can be hard to measure. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify the ability of an observable to separate these opposite contributions and therefore to revive the interference effects at experiments. We apply this strategy to the anomalous gluon operator in the SMEFT, for which the linear-term suppression is well known. We show that we can get, for the first time, constraints on its coefficient from the interference only that are similar to those from the square of the new-physics amplitude.</description>

      <title>Gauge coupling unification and proton decay via 45 Higgs boson in SU(5) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gauge coupling unification (GCU) and proton decay in a non-supersymmetric SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) incorporating a 45 representation Higgs field. Our analysis is based on the assumption that Georgi-Jarlskog-type mass matrices for fermions are responsible for explaining the mass ratio of the strange quark and the muon. We examine the conditions of GCU, taking into account the possibility that certain components of the 45 Higgs field have masses much smaller than the GUT scale. We have found that to satisfy the GCU conditions, at least two components of the 45 Higgs field should have such small masses. We search the parameter space to identify regions where the GCU conditions are satisfied, in the scenarios where two or three components of the 45 Higgs boson are hierarchically light. If the colored Higgs component of the 45 Higgs boson has a mass much smaller than the GUT scale, proton decay via colored Higgs boson exchange can occur with an observably large rate. We estimate the mass bounds for the colored Higgs component from the proton decay search at Super- Kamiokande and thereby further restrict the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We systematically study the 1D charmonium spin-triplet (with the $J^{PC}=1^{--}, 2^{--}, 3^{--}$) and spin-singlet (with the $J^{PC}=2^{-+}$) via the QCD sum rules in comparison with the recent experimental results. The predicted mass $M_{\psi_1}=3.77\pm{0.09}\,\rm {GeV}$ supports identifying the $\psi_1$ as the $\psi(3770)$, the value $M_{\psi_2}=3.82\pm{0.09}\,\rm {GeV}$ is consistent with the reported observation of the $\psi_2(3823)$, the prediction $M_{\psi_3}=3.84\pm{0.08}\,\rm {GeV}$ supports identifying the $\psi_3$ as the $\psi_3(3842)$. Additionally, we estimate the unobserved $\eta_{c2}$ state lies at $3.83\pm{0.09}\,\rm {GeV}$, and suggest detection prospects in the future. More experimental data will help us to unravel the mass spectrum of the charmonium states near the open-charm thresholds.</description>

      <title>Comparable Dark Matter and Baryon energy densities from Dark Grand Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a theory of $SU(9)$ dark grand unification, where dark matter consists of asymmetric dark baryons from the $Sp(4)_D$ dark QCD sector. By unifying the dark color gauge group with the Standard Model gauge group, the asymmetry generation in both sectors originates from a common process that preserves a $U(1)_{D-(B-L)}$ symmetry, resulting in comparable number densities. Furthermore, thanks to dark grand unification, the $Sp(4)_D$ dark QCD sector shares a similar matter content with the QCD sector, leading to comparable running of the gauge couplings from the scale as high as $10^{15}$ GeV. This predicts a dark color confinement scale and thus dark baryon masses around the GeV scale, comparable to visible baryon masses. Together with the similar number densities, the model provides an explanation for the observed similarity between the energy densities of dark matter and baryons, $\rho_D \approx 5\,\rho_B$. The model also features some novel phenomenology, including a GeV-scale flavored dark QCD sector with diquark dark baryons and light dark mesons. The interaction between the dark sector and the visible sector occurs via a new $Z'$ boson with a mass of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV, which could be searched for at future hadron colliders. We also briefly discuss an $SU(8)$ dark grand unified theory featuring an $SU(3)_D$ dark QCD sector.</description>

Abstract: The emission of a photon by an electron in an intense laser field is one of the most fundamental processes in electrodynamics and underlies the many applications that utilize high-energy photon beams. This process is typically studied for electrons colliding head-on with a stationary-focus laser pulse. Here, we show that the energy lost by electrons in the quantum regime and the yield of emitted photons can be substantially increased by replacing a stationary-focus pulse with an equal-energy flying-focus pulse whose focus co-propagates with the electrons. These advantages of the flying focus result from the energy loss and the photon yield scaling more favorably with the interaction time than the laser intensity in the quantum regime, with the latter also holding in the classical regime. Monte Carlo simulations of electrons colliding with equal-energy stationary and flying-focus laser pulses demonstrate these advantages.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature bubble nucleation with shifting scale hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on supercooled phase transitions in models with classical scale symmetry, we formulate a state-of-the art framework for computing the bubble-nucleation rate, accounting for the presence of various energy scales. In particular, we examine the limitations of derivative expansions in constructing a thermal effective field theory for bubble nucleation. We show that for gauge field fluctuations, derivative expansions diverge after the leading two orders due to the strong variation in gauge field masses between the high- and low-temperature phases. By directly computing these contributions using the fluctuation determinant, we capture these effects while also accounting for large explicit logarithms at two loops, utilising the exact renormalisation group structure of the EFT. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach significantly improves nucleation rate calculations compared to leading-order results, providing a more robust framework for predicting gravitational-wave signals from supercooled phase transitions in models such as the SU(2)cSM.</description>

      <title>Linking the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event to Dark Matter Decay and Gravitational Wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event, dubbed KM3-230213A. This is the first observed neutrino event with energy of the order of $\mathcal{O}(100) {\rm PeV}$, the origin of which remains unclear. In this paper, we interpret this high energy neutrino event in terms of the Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) $\chi$ decays via the right-handed (RH) neutrino portal assuming the Type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses and mixings. Furthermore, the Dirac fermion dark matter $\chi$ is assumed to be charged under $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the dark Higgs $\Phi$. In this scenario, DM can decay into a pair of Standard Model (SM) particles, such as neutrinos, leptons, and gauge bosons via the RH neutrino portals for $v_\Phi \gg m_\chi$. Then we can reply on the HDMSpectra package to generate the neutrino and $\gamma$-ray spectra from heavy DM decays. If the DM mass is around $440\ {\rm PeV}$ with a lifetime $5\times 10^{29}$ sec, it can account for the KM3-230213A event. However, such heavy DM cannot be produced through the thermal freeze-out mechanism due to overproduction and violation of unitarity bounds. We focus on the UV freeze-in production of DM through a dimension-5 operator, which helps in producing the DM dominantly in the early Universe. Finally, the large value of the dark Higgs field VEV opens up the intriguing possibility of generating gravitational waves (GWs) spectra from cosmic strings. We have found a reasonable set of parameter values that can address the KM3NeT signal, yield the correct value of the DM relic density through freeze-in mechanism, and allow for the possible detection of GW signal at the future detectors.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of Flavor SU(3) analyses of $B\to PP$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an SU(3) analysis of $B\to PP$ decays based on reduced matrix elements (RMEs), with $P$ being a light pseudoscalar meson excluding $\eta^{(\prime)}$. We show that a complete basis for the $B\to PP$ decays consists of ten RMEs, where the three RMEs arise from the electroweak penguin operators $O_{7,8}$. In the Standard Model, the relevant Wilson coefficients are small and thus can be neglected. We further demonstrate the equivalence of the RME approach with the irreducible representation amplitude (IRA) and topological diagram amplitude (TDA) methods, and derive relations between the ten RME amplitudes and corresponding IRA/TDA amplitudes. These relations lay a foundation for consistent SU(3) analyses of heavy meson decays.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for the integrand-level reduction of two-loop helicity amplitudes in both $d=4-2\epsilon$ and $d=4$ dimensions. The amplitude is expressed in terms of a set of Feynman integrals and their coefficients that depend on the external kinematics. The analysis presented in this paper, in conjunction with the ongoing development of the computational framework $\text{HELAC-2LOOP}$, paves the road for the construction of an automated program for two-loop amplitude calculations for arbitrary scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Universality of scaling entropy in charged hadron multiplicity distributions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the scaling behavior of the entropy associated with the charged hadron multiplicity distribution P(N) in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the growth of this entropic indicator as a function of the Bjorken x variable exhibits a universal behavior, consistent with observations from deep inelastic scattering (DIS). This universality suggests that the entropy scaling is a property of the initial state and reflects the diffusive nature of gluon dynamics at small x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-multiplicity events are not accurately described by traditional KNO scaling and require a more precise description based on a diffusion scaling framework. This new scaling emerges naturally from the universal growth of partonic entropy and offers a deeper insight into the dynamics of particle production in high-energy hadronic collisions.</description>

      <title>Extracting the kinetic freeze-out properties of high energy pp collisions at the LHC with event shape classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event shape measurements are crucial for understanding the underlying event and multiple-parton interactions (MPIs) in high energy proton-proton (pp) collisions. In this paper, the Tsallis Blast-Wave model with independent non-extensive parameters for mesons and baryons, was applied to analyze transverse momentum spectra of charged pions, kaons, and protons in pp collision events at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV classified by event shape estimators relative transverse event activity, unweighted transverse spherocity, and flattenicity. Our analysis reveals consistent trends in the kinetic freeze-out temperature and non-extensive parameter across different collision systems and event shape classes. The use of diverse event-shape observables in pp collisions has significantly expanded the accessible freeze-out parameter space, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of its boundaries. Among these event shape classifiers, flattenicity emerges as a unique observable for disentangling hard process contributions from additive MPI effects, allowing the isolation of collective motion effects encoded by the radial flow velocity. Through the analysis of the interplay between event-shape measurements and kinetic freeze-out properties, we gain deeper insights into the mechanisms responsible for flow-like signatures in pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Searching for charged Higgs bosons with flavor-changing couplings at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the LHC discovery prospects for charged Higgs bosons in the general two Higgs doublet model (G2HDM) that has flavor-changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) couplings. The FCNH $\rho_{tc}$ coupling induces intriguing $H^+$ production processes $c\bar b \to H^+$, $cg \to bH^+$, and $\bar bg \to \bar cH^+$ without CKM suppression. Sizable $\rho_{tc}$ can drive the disappearance of antimatter from the Universe. In this contribution, we promote the resonant $c\bar b \to H^+$ production, followed by the bosonic $H^+ \to W^+ H$ decay. Discovery could be a harbinger of G2HDM with FCNH couplings, and perhaps shed light on the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Models for the Electric Dipole Moment and Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Tau Lepton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle II experiment and other ongoing and projected lepton facilities are expected to greatly enhance the sensitivity to the electric dipole moment (EDM) and anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) for the tau lepton, making it timely to explore models that predict these observables. We present a class of models that generate a sizable EDM and $g-2$ of the tau lepton via radiative tau mass generation. Two benchmark models with different hypercharge assignments are investigated. The first model contains neutral fermions and charged scalars. We find that the model can predict a large signal of the tau EDM, $d_{\tau} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-19}) \, e \, {\rm cm}$, and $g-2$, $a_{\tau} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, which are within the reach of future updates of their measurements. In contrast, the second model, containing a charged fermion and neutral scalars, yields a similar magnitude for the $g-2$ but predicts a comparatively smaller EDM signal. Our models serve as benchmarks for new physics generating sizable EDM and $g-2$ of the tau lepton.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium in a QCD medium with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the properties of quarkonia in a hot QCD medium using a newly proposed collision kernel that consistently incorporates the particle's momentum dependence into the relaxation time scale of the medium. The longitudinal component of the gluon self-energy, along with the Debye screening mass, is computed within the one-loop hard thermal loop framework by incorporating non-equilibrium corrections. A modified kinetic theory with an extended relaxation time approximation is employed to model the non-equilibrium dynamics of the QCD medium. The sensitivity of the heavy quarkonia potential to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is studied. Further, we studied the binding energy and thermal width of quarkonia states within this new kinetic theory. Sizable variations in the temperature behavior of these quantities are observed in comparison with the standard relaxation time approximation method due to the particle momentum dependence on the relaxation timescale of the QCD medium. Our findings highlight that accounting for the microscopic nature of the collision timescale is crucial for understanding the quarkonium behavior in a QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD below charm threshold: theory and tensions with $e^+e^-$ data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we carefully assess the theory prediction for $R(s)$ below charm threshold, $R_{uds}$, and address tensions with the existing data, notably with the 2021 BES-III results. We analyze the uncertainty of the perturbative QCD description in the light of renormalons making use of the large-$\beta_0$ limit and the renormalon-free gluon-condensate scheme. We provide a reliable estimate of the duality violation contributions; we show they are sizable up to $2.5$~GeV and improve the agreement between theory and data, but are negligible for higher energies. We then combine the available experimental data for $R_{uds}$ and find the data sets to be mutually compatible. Finally, we compare theory and data, both locally and in their contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Theory is compatible with the combined data but discrepancies with the BES-III data reach more than 3$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics Approach for Extracting and Emulating Continuum Physics Based on Bound-State-Like Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified emulation framework for studying continuum physics in finite quantum systems. Using a reduced basis method, we construct powerful emulators for the inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation that operate in a combined parameter space of complex energy ($E$) and other inputs ($\bm{\theta}$). Within the space, the emulators simultaneously perform analytical continuation in $E$ -- extracting continuum physics from numerically simpler bound-state-like calculations -- and interpolate this entire process across $\bm{\theta}$. This yields a small, non-Hermitian system whose properties (e.g., resonances and scattering observables) can be rapidly predicted for any $\bm{\theta}$. Crucially, the complex-$E$ emulation provides a pathway to compute continuum observables for complex systems where advanced bound-state methods exist but direct continuum calculations are yet to be developed, while the $\bm{\theta}$-emulation enables rapid parameter-space exploration and can be adapted to accelerate other existing continuum calculations. Demonstrations with two- and three-body systems highlight the method's effectiveness and suggest its connection to (near-)optimal rational approximation. This Letter presents the key results, with further details reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>CaloChallenge 2022: A Community Challenge for Fast Calorimeter Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the "Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge 2022" - the CaloChallenge. We study state-of-the-art generative models on four calorimeter shower datasets of increasing dimensionality, ranging from a few hundred voxels to a few tens of thousand voxels. The 31 individual submissions span a wide range of current popular generative architectures, including Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Normalizing Flows, Diffusion models, and models based on Conditional Flow Matching. We compare all submissions in terms of quality of generated calorimeter showers, as well as shower generation time and model size. To assess the quality we use a broad range of different metrics including differences in 1-dimensional histograms of observables, KPD/FPD scores, AUCs of binary classifiers, and the log-posterior of a multiclass classifier. The results of the CaloChallenge provide the most complete and comprehensive survey of cutting-edge approaches to calorimeter fast simulation to date. In addition, our work provides a uniquely detailed perspective on the important problem of how to evaluate generative models. As such, the results presented here should be applicable for other domains that use generative AI and require fast and faithful generation of samples in a large phase space.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: Detailed description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, I develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators rapidly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) across a parameter space that includes both complex energy and other real-valued physical inputs in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, one now has a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates those extractions in the input parameter space. Building on a prior Letter [\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309}{[arXiv:2408.03309}], this article provides the full theoretical details, a comprehensive analysis of the method's performance, and a brief discussion of how it can be coupled with existing continuum approaches to perform emulations in their input parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei is set to provide the most stringent test of lepton-flavor symmetry and a window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, to disentangle new lepton-flavor-violating interactions, in combination with information from $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to 3e$, it is critical that uncertainties at each step of the analysis be controlled and fully quantified. In this regard, nuclear response functions related to the coupling to neutrons are notoriously problematic, since they are not directly constrained by experiment. We address these shortcomings by combining ab initio calculations with a recently improved determination of charge distributions from electron scattering by exploiting strong correlations among charge, point-proton, and point-neutron radii and densities. We present overlap integrals for $^{27}$Al, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ti including full covariance matrices, allowing, for the first time, for a comprehensive consideration of nuclear structure uncertainties in the interpretation of $\mu\to e$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Massive Boson Stars using Gravitational Waves from Fundamental Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boson Stars are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects would manifest as dark Boson stars and, in the absence of electromagnetic signatures, could mimic properties of compact stars in the gravitational wave spectrum. In a recent study, using the simplest potential for massive Boson stars, we demonstrated that fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) obey scaling relations that allow them to be distinguished from neutron stars and black holes. In this work, we provide analytical fits for these scaling relations, valid for the dark matter parameter space compatible with current astrophysical and cosmological data, that can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive Boson stars in the strong coupling regime, avoiding the need for numerical calculations. We also provide analytical fits for empirical and universal relations for gravitational wave asteroseismology, which can be used to infer microscopic dark matter properties following a successful detection. Further, we investigate the possibility of detection of $f$-modes and the dark matter parameter space that can be probed with current and future gravitational wave detectors across multiple frequency bands. Assuming a burst gravitational wave model and demanding a signal-to-noise ratio of 5, we show that the current and future detectors can, in principle, probe Boson star $f$-modes up to cosmological distances: 1 Mpc with aLIGO, 30 Mpc with Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, and in the best case scenario, about 300 Mpc with LISA.</description>

      <title>Dissipative currents and transport coefficients in relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the form of dissipative currents at the first order in relativistic spin hydrodynamics with finite chemical potential including gradients of the spin potential. Taking advantage of isotropy in the hydrodynamic local rest frame, using a suitable matching condition for the flow velocity and enforcing the semi-positivity of entropy production, we find 23 dissipative transport coefficients relating dissipative currents to gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields: 4 for the symmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor, 5 for the antisymmetric part, 3 for the conserved vector current, and 11 for the spin tensor. We compare our finding with previous results in literature.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum State Preparation via Large-Language-Model-Driven Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient quantum state preparation remains a central challenge in first-principles quantum simulations of dynamics in quantum field theories, where the Hilbert space is intrinsically infinite-dimensional. Here, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-assisted framework for quantum-circuit design that systematically scales state-preparation circuits to large lattice volumes. Applied to a 1+1d XY spin chain, the LLM autonomously discovers a compact 4-parameter circuit that captures boundary-induced symmetry breaking with sub-percent energy deviation, enabling successful validation on the \texttt{Zuchongzhi} quantum processor. Guided by this insight, we extend the framework to 2+1d quantum field theories, where scalable variational ans\"atze have remained elusive. For a scalar field theory, the search yields a symmetry-preserving, 3-parameter shallow-depth ansatz whose optimized parameters converge to size-independent constants for lattices $n \ge 4$, providing, to our knowledge, the first scalable ansatz for this class of 2+1d models. Our results establish a practical route toward AI-assisted, human-guided discovery in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>The Tension of Space as Dark Energy: A No Geometric Sequestering Theorem for Minimal Sequesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model space as an elastic membrane and identify its uniform tension $T_s$ with the vacuum energy density of space. The central result is a no geometric sequestering theorem. In any minimal matter vacuum sequester framework where a global constraint cancels constant contributions from the matter sector by adjusting a global variable, a purely geometric unit operator remains intact. Concretely a volume term of the form $S_s = - T_s \int \sqrt{-g} \, d^4 x$ does not couple to the global variable that enforces the matter cancellation and it survives unchanged in the local field equations. We establish this result within a covariant effective field theory using the background field method. The analysis shows that the coefficient $T_s$ is renormalized by graviton loops and in general by mixed matter-graviton loops and therefore runs with the renormalization scale $\mu$. The running defines an effective cosmological term $T_s(\mu)$ that is present even after the matter vacuum energy has been neutralized by the sequester constraint. In particular we find that $T_s(\mu)$ sources $G_{\mu \nu} = - T_s(\mu) \, g_{\mu \nu} + \cdots$. The tension term $T_s(\mu)$ can then be understood as residual dark energy in the minimal sequestering framework.</description>

      <title>On Casimir effect in Yang-Mills theories in three and four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the Casimir energy for the configuration of two parallel plates coupled to nonabelian gauge fields with a Yang-Mills action. We consider both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions in the manifestly gauge-invariant formalism we have pursued over the last several years which allows us to factor out the gauge degrees of freedom. A boundary action in the functional integral, equivalent to the insertion of operators representing the plates, is used to enforce the required boundary conditions for the gauge fields. The result is for a kinematic regime corresponding to the exchange of gluons with a dynamically generated mass. We find good agreement in 2+1 dimensions and reasonable agreement in 3+1 dimensions with lattice-based numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Extracting Properties of Dark Dense Environments around Black Holes from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially revealing the properties of the dark sector and shedding light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant DM parameters.</description>
