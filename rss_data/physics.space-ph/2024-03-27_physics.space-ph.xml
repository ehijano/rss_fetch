      <title>On the Heating of the Slow Solar-Wind by Imbalanced Alfv\'en-Wave Turbulence from 0.06 au to 1 au: Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze plasma and magnetic field data provided by the Parker Solar Probe (\emph{PSP}) and Solar Orbiter (\emph{SO}) missions to investigate the radial evolution of the heating of Alfv\'enic slow wind (ASW) by imbalanced Alfv\'en-Wave (AW) turbulent fluctuations from 0.06 au to 1 au. in our analysis we focus on slow solar-wind intervals with highly imbalanced and incompressible turbulence (i.e., magnetic compressibility $C_B=\delta B/B\leq 0.25$, plasma compressibility $C_n=\delta n/n\leq 0.25$ and normalized cross-helicity $\sigma_c\geq 0.65$). First, we estimate the AW turbulent dissipation rate from the wave energy equation and find that the radial profile trend is similar to the proton heating rate. Second, we find that the scaling of the empirical AW turbulent dissipation rate $Q_W$ obtained from the wave energy equation matches the scaling from the phenomenological AW turbulent dissipation rate $Q_{\rm CH09}$ (with $Q_{\rm CH09}\simeq 1.55 Q_W$) derived by~\cite{chandran09} based on the model of reflection-driven turbulence. Our results suggest that, as in the fast solar wind, AW turbulence plays a major role in the ion heating that occurs in incompressible slow-wind streams.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en Waves at Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind upstream of Mars's bow shock can be described in terms of Alfv\'enic turbulence, with an incompressible energy cascade rate of $10^{-17}$ J m$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ at magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) scales. The solar wind has more Alfv\'en waves propagating outwards from the Sun (than inwards) and a median Alfv\'en ratio of $\sim0.33$. Newly ionized planetary protons associated with the extended hydrogen corona generate waves at the local proton cyclotron frequency. These 'proton cyclotron waves' (PCW) mostly correspond to fast magnetosonic waves, although the ion cyclotron (Alfv\'enic) wave mode is possible for large Interplanetary Magnetic Field cone angles. PCW do not show significant effects on the solar wind energy cascade rates at MHD scales but could affect smaller scales. The magnetosheath displays high amplitude wave activity, with high occurrence rate of Alfv\'en waves. Turbulence appears not fully developed in the magnetosheath, suggesting fluctuations do not have enough time to interact in this small-size region. Some studies suggest PCW affect turbulence in the magnetosheath. Overall, wave activity is reduced inside the magnetic pile-up region and the Martian ionosphere. However, under certain conditions, upstream waves can reach the upper ionosphere. So far, there have not been conclusive observations of Alfv\'en waves in the ionosphere or along crustal magnetic fields, which could be due to the lack of adequate observations.</description>

      <title>Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N : A $\mathcal{O}(N)$ software for N-body integration in collisional and fragmenting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is a $N$-body software developed for the time-efficient integration of collisional and fragmenting systems of planetesimals or moonlets orbiting a central mass. It features a fragmentation model, based on crater scaling and ejecta models, able to realistically simulate a violent impact. The user of Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N can choose between four different built-in modules to compute self-gravity and detect collisions. One of these makes use of a mesh-based algorithm to treat mutual interactions in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time. Another module, much more efficient than the standard Barnes-Hut tree code, is a $\mathcal{O}(N)$ tree-based algorithm called FalcON. It relies on fast multipole expansion for gravity computation and we adapted it to collision detection as well. Computation time is reduced by building the tree structure using a three-dimensional Hilbert curve. For the same precision in mutual gravity computation, Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is found to be up to 25 times faster than the famous software REBOUND. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is written entirely in the C language and only needs a C compiler to run. A python add-on, that requires only basic python libraries, produces animations of the simulations from the output files. The name Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N, reminding of a scorpion, comes from the French $N$-corps, meaning $N$-body, and from the mathematical notation $\mathcal{O}(N)$, due to the running time of the software being almost linear in the total number $N$ of moonlets. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is designed for the study of accreting or fragmenting disks of planetesimal or moonlets. It detects collisions and computes mutual gravity faster than REBOUND, and unlike other $N$-body integrators, it can resolve a collision by fragmentation. The fast multipole expansions are implemented up to order six to allow for a high precision in mutual gravity computation.</description>
