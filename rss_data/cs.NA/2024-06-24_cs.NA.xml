      <title>Convergence rates for random feature neural network approximation in molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random feature neural network approximations of the potential in Hamiltonian systems yield approximations of molecular dynamics correlation observables that have the expected error $\mathcal{O}\big((K^{-1}+J^{-1/2})^{\frac{1}{2}}\big)$, for networks with $K$ nodes using $J$ data points, provided the Hessians of the potential and the observables are bounded. The loss function is based on the least squares error of the potential and regularizations, with the data points sampled from the Gibbs density. The proof uses an elementary new derivation of the generalization error for random feature networks that does not apply the Rademacher or related complexities.</description>

      <title>An adaptive Levin method for complicated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe an adaptive Levin method for numerically evaluating integrals of the form $\int_\Omega f(\mathbf x) \exp(i g(\mathbf x)) \,d\Omega$ over general domains that have been meshed by transfinite elements. On each element, we apply the multivariate Levin method over adaptively refined sub-elements, until the integral has been computed to the desired accuracy. Resonance points on the boundaries of the elements are handled by the application of the univariate adaptive Levin method. When the domain does not contain stationary points, the cost of the resulting method is essentially independent of the frequency, even in the presence of resonance points.</description>

      <title>A new flow dynamic approach for Wasserstein gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop in this paper a new regularized flow dynamic approach to construct efficient numerical schemes for Wasserstein gradient flows in Lagrangian coordinates. Instead of approximating the Wasserstein distance which needs to solve constrained minimization problems, we reformulate the problem using the Benamou-Brenier's flow dynamic approach, leading to algorithms which only need to solve unconstrained minimization problem in $L^2$ distance. Our schemes automatically inherit some essential properties of Wasserstein gradient systems such as positivity-preserving, mass conservative and energy dissipation. We present ample numerical simulations of Porous-Medium equations, Keller-Segel equations and Aggregation equations to validate the accuracy and stability of the proposed schemes. Compared to numerical schemes in Eulerian coordinates, our new schemes can capture sharp interfaces for various Wasserstein gradient flows using relatively smaller number of unknowns.</description>

      <title>A multi-mesh approach for accurate computation of multi-target functionals in aerodynamics design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerodynamic optimal design is crucial for enhancing performance of aircrafts, while calculating multi-target functionals through solving dual equations with arbitrary right-hand sides remains challenging. In this paper, a novel multi-target framework of DWR-based mesh refinement is proposed and analyzed. Theoretically, an extrapolation method is generalized to expand multi-variable functionals, which guarantees the dual equations of different objective functionals can be calculated separately. Numerically, an algorithm of calculating multi-target functionals is designed based on the multi-mesh approach, which can help to obtain different dual solutions simultaneously. One feature of our framework is the algorithm is easy to implement with the help of the hierarchical geometry tree structure and the calculation avoids the Galerkin orthogonality naturally. The framework takes a balance between different targets even when they are not the same orders of magnitude. While existing approach uses a linear combination of different components in multi-target functionals for adaptation, it introduces additional coefficients for adjusting. With each component calculated under a dual-consistent scheme, this multi-mesh framework addresses challenges such as the lift-drag ratio and other kinds of multi-target functionals, ensuring smooth convergence and precise calculations of dual solutions.</description>

      <title>An entropy-stable and fully well-balanced scheme for the Euler equations with gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work concerns the derivation of a numerical scheme to approximate weak solutions of the Euler equations with a gravitational source term. The designed scheme is proved to be fully well-balanced since it is able to exactly preserve all moving equilibrium solutions, as well as the corresponding steady solutions at rest obtained when the velocity vanishes. Moreover, the proposed scheme is entropy-preserving since it satisfies all fully discrete entropy inequalities. In addition, in order to satisfy the required admissibility of the approximate solutions, the positivity of both approximate density and pressure is established. Several numerical experiments attest the relevance of the developed numerical method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sparse Kaczmarz method is a famous and widely used iterative method for solving the regularized basis pursuit problem. A general scheme of the surrogate hyperplane sparse Kaczmarz method is proposed. In particular, a class of residual-based surrogate hyperplane sparse Kaczmarz method is introduced and the implementations are well discussed. Their convergence theories are proved and the linear convergence rates are studied and compared in details. Numerical experiments verify the efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple formula to update the pseudoinverse of a full-rank rectangular matrix that undergoes a low-rank modification, and demonstrate its utility for solving least squares problems. The resulting algorithm can be dramatically faster than solving the modified least squares problem from scratch, just like the speedup enabled by Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury for solving linear systems with low-rank modifications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimisation Framework using the Core Imaging Library and Synergistic Image Reconstruction Framework for PET Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic framework into the open--source Core Imaging Library (CIL) which enables easy development of stochastic algorithms. Five such algorithms from the literature are developed, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Stochastic Average Gradient (-Am\'elior\'e), (Loopless) Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient. We showcase the functionality of the framework with a comparative study against a deterministic algorithm on a simulated 2D PET dataset, with the use of the open-source Synergistic Image Reconstruction Framework. We observe that stochastic optimisation methods can converge in fewer passes of the data than a standard deterministic algorithm.</description>

      <title>A macroscopic pedestrian model with variable maximal density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel macroscopic (fluid dynamics) model for describing pedestrian flow in low and high density regimes. The model is characterized by the fact that the maximal density reachable by the crowd - usually a fixed model parameter - is instead a state variable. To do that, the model couples a conservation law, devised as usual for tracking the evolution of the crowd density, with a Burgers-like PDE with a nonlocal term describing the evolution of the maximal density. The variable maximal density is used here to describe the effects of the psychological/physical pushing forces which are observed in crowds during competitive or emergency situations. Specific attention is also dedicated to the fundamental diagram, i.e., the function which expresses the relationship between crowd density and flux. Although the model needs a well defined fundamental diagram as known input parameter, it is not evident a priori which relationship between density and flux will be actually observed, due to the time-varying maximal density. An a posteriori analysis shows that the observed fundamental diagram has an elongated "tail" in the congested region, thus resulting similar to the concave/concave fundamental diagram with a "double hump" observed in real crowds.</description>

      <title>Robust parameter estimation for partially observed second-order diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating parameters of a diffusion process given continuous-time observations of the process via maximum likelihood approaches or, online, via stochastic gradient descent or Kalman filter formulations constitutes a well-established research area. It has also been established previously that these techniques are, in general, not robust to perturbations in the data in the form of temporal correlations. While the subject is relatively well understood and appropriate modifications have been suggested in the context of multi-scale diffusion processes and their reduced model equations, we consider here an alternative setting where a second-order diffusion process in positions and velocities is only observed via its positions. In this note, we propose a simple modification to standard stochastic gradient descent and Kalman filter formulations, which eliminates the arising systematic estimation biases. The modification can be extended to standard maximum likelihood approaches and avoids computation of previously proposed correction terms.</description>

      <title>On the growth of the parameters of approximating ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the analysis of fully connected feed forward ReLU neural networks as they approximate a given, smooth function. In contrast to conventionally studied universal approximation properties under increasing architectures, e.g., in terms of width or depth of the networks, we are concerned with the asymptotic growth of the parameters of approximating networks. Such results are of interest, e.g., for error analysis or consistency results for neural network training. The main result of our work is that, for a ReLU architecture with state of the art approximation error, the realizing parameters grow at most polynomially. The obtained rate with respect to a normalized network size is compared to existing results and is shown to be superior in most cases, in particular for high dimensional input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell equations set on a domain made up of two subdomains that represent a magnetic conductor and a non-magnetic material, and we assume that the relative magnetic permeability $\mu_{r}$ between the two materials is high. We prove uniform a priori estimates for Maxwell solutions when the interface between the two subdomains is supposed to be Lipschitz. Assuming smoothness for the interface between the subdomains, we prove also that the magnetic field possesses a multiscale expansion in powers of $1/ \sqrt{\mu_{r}}$ with profiles rapidly decaying inside the magnetic conductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07268v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study space--time isogeometric discretizations of the linear acoustic wave equation that use splines of arbitrary degree p, both in space and time. We propose a space--time variational formulation that is obtained by adding a non-consistent penalty term of order 2p+2 to the bilinear form coming from integration by parts. This formulation, when discretized with tensor-product spline spaces with maximal regularity in time, is unconditionally stable: the mesh size in time is not constrained by the mesh size in space. We give extensive numerical evidence for the good stability, approximation, dissipation and dispersion properties of the stabilized isogeometric formulation, comparing against stabilized finite element schemes, for a range of wave propagation problems with constant and variable wave speed.</description>

      <title>Predictions Based on Pixel Data: Insights from PDEs and Finite Differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As supported by abundant experimental evidence, neural networks are state-of-the-art for many approximation tasks in high-dimensional spaces. Still, there is a lack of a rigorous theoretical understanding of what they can approximate, at which cost, and at which accuracy. One network architecture of practical use, especially for approximation tasks involving images, is (residual) convolutional networks. However, due to the locality of the linear operators involved in these networks, their analysis is more complicated than that of fully connected neural networks. This paper deals with approximation of time sequences where each observation is a matrix. We show that with relatively small networks, we can represent exactly a class of numerical discretizations of PDEs based on the method of lines. We constructively derive these results by exploiting the connections between discrete convolution and finite difference operators. Our network architecture is inspired by those typically adopted in the approximation of time sequences. We support our theoretical results with numerical experiments simulating the linear advection, heat, and Fisher equations.</description>

We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method for quadratic basis functions and quadratic triangles by integrating it into a boundary element code and solving several scattering problems in 3D. We also give numerical evidence that the utilization of curved boundary elements enhances computational efficiency compared to conventional planar elements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present refined generalization bounds for the Deep Ritz Method (DRM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). For the DRM, we focus on two prototype elliptic PDEs: Poisson equation and static Schr\"odinger equation on the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube with the Neumann boundary condition. And sharper generalization bounds are derived based on the localization techniques under the assumptions that the exact solutions of the PDEs lie in the Barron spaces or the general Sobolev spaces. For the PINNs, we investigate the general linear second elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary condition via the local Rademacher complexity in the multi-task learning.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Primitive Conservative Solver for the Euler Equations with Arbitrary Equation of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a procedure to solve the Euler equations by explicitly updating, in a conservative manner, a generic thermodynamic variable such as temperature, pressure or entropy instead of the total energy. The presented procedure is valid for any equation of state and spatial discretization. When using complex equations of state such as Span-Wagner, choosing the temperature as the generic thermodynamic variable yields great reductions in the computational costs associated to thermodynamic evaluations. Results computed with a state of the art thermodynamic model are presented, and computational times are analyzed. Particular attention is dedicated to the conservation of total energy, the propagation speed of shock waves and jump conditions. The procedure is thoroughly tested using the Span-Wagner equation of state through the CoolProp thermodynamic library and the Van der Waals equation of state, both in the ideal and non-ideal compressible fluid-dynamics regimes, by comparing it to the standard total energy update and analytical solutions where available.</description>

      <title>An extrapolation-driven network architecture for physics-informed deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Identifiability, the KL property in metric spaces, and subgradient curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifiability, and the closely related idea of partial smoothness, unify classical active set methods and more general notions of solution structure. Diverse optimization algorithms generate iterates in discrete time that are eventually confined to identifiable sets. We present two fresh perspectives on identifiability. The first distills the notion to a simple metric property, applicable not just in Euclidean settings but to optimization over manifolds and beyond; the second reveals analogous continuous-time behavior for subgradient descent curves. The Kurdya-Lojasiewicz property typically governs convergence in both discrete and continuous time: we explore its interplay with identifiability.</description>

      <title>Total variation regularization for recovering the spatial source term in a time-fractional diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an inverse space-dependent source problem for a time-fractional diffusion equation. To deal with the ill-posedness of the problem, we transform the problem into an optimal control problem with total variational (TV) regularization. In contrast to the classical Tikhonov model incorporating $L^2$ penalty terms, the inclusion of a TV term proves advantageous in reconstructing solutions that exhibit discontinuities or piecewise constancy. The control problem is approximated by a fully discrete scheme, and convergence results are provided within this framework. Furthermore, a lineraed primal-dual iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the discrete control model based on an equivalent saddle-point reformulation, and several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>
