      <title>Modeling APOKASC-3 red giants: I. The first dredge-up and red giant branch bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on two key diagnostics of stellar physics in red giant branch (RGB) stars: the first dredge-up (FDU) of nuclear processed material and the location of the red giant branch bump (RGBB). We compare asteroseismic and spectroscopic APOKASC-3 data with theoretical MESA models. Our FDU predictions have similar mass and metallicity trends to the data, but the observed magnitude of the change in $[{\rm C}/{\rm N}]$ in data is smaller than theoretical predictions by $0.1615 \pm 0.0760 \,({\rm obs}) \pm 0.0108 \,({\rm sys}) \,{\rm dex}$. These results are insensitive to the input physics, but they are at a level consistent with systematic uncertainties in the abundance measurements. When we include observed trends in birth $[{\rm C}/{\rm Fe}]$ and $[{\rm N}/{\rm Fe}]$ in our models, it modestly stretches the metallicity dependent difference relative to the data. We find a well-defined empirical RGBB locus: $\log g = 2.6604 - 0.1832 (M/{\rm M}_\odot-1) + 0.2824 \,[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]$. Our model RGBB loci have mass and composition trends that mirror the data, but we find that the observed RGBB is $0.1509 \pm 0.0017 \,({\rm obs}) \pm 0.0182 \,({\rm sys})$ magnitudes higher than predicted across the board, similar to prior literature results. We find that envelope overshooting, proposed solution to reconcile theory with data, increases ${\rm Li}$ destruction during the FDU at higher metallicities, creating tension with depletion observed in GALAH data. We propose ${\rm Li}$ in the FDU as a sensitive test of the RGBB and FDU, and discuss other potential solutions.</description>

      <title>Ion Beam Instabilities during Solar Flare Energy Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of waves driven by ion beams produced during solar flare energy release are explored to assess their role in driving abundance enhancements in minority species such as $^3$He and in controlling, through pitch-angle scattering, proton/alpha confinement during energy release. The Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS) is used to solve the linear dispersion relation for a population of energetic, reconnection-accelerated protons streaming into a cold background plasma. We assume equal densities of the two populations, using an anisotropic ($T_\parallel/T_\perp = 10$), one-sided kappa distribution for the energetic streaming population and a cold Maxwellian for the background. We find two unstable modes with parallel propagation: a right-handed wave with a frequency of the order of the proton cyclotron frequency ($\Omega_{cp}$) and a left-handed, lower frequency mode. We also find highly oblique modes with frequencies below $\Omega_{cp}$ that are unstable for higher beam energies. Through resonant interactions, all three modes will contribute to the scattering of the high-energy protons, thereby limiting their transport out of the flare-acceleration region. The higher-frequency oblique mode, which can be characterized as a kinetic Alfv\'en wave, will preferentially heat $^3$He, making it a good candidate for the driver of the abundance enhancements commonly observed for this species in impulsive events.</description>

      <title>Comparing Methods for Calculating Solar Energetic Particle Intensities: Re-binning versus Spectral Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been observed for decades in the interplanetary medium by spacecraft measuring the intensity of energetic ions and electrons. These intensities provide valuable information about particle acceleration, the effects of bulk plasma dynamics on particle transport, and the anisotropy of particle distributions. Since measured intensities are typically reported in narrow energy bins, it is common to re-bin intensities over a wider energy range to improve counting statistics. We investigate two methods for calculating intensities across multiple energy bins: a) \textit{re-binned intensity} (\(\overline{j}_{\rm linlin}\)), which is calculated by integrating the intensity over energy space and corresponds to the intensity at an effective energy that depends on the time-varying spectral index, and b) \textit{spectral binned intensity} (\(\overline{j}_{\rm loglog}\)), calculated by integrating the log-intensity in log-energy space, yielding the intensity at the log-centered energy that is independent of the spectral index and remains constant over time. We compare these methods using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) IS\(\odot\)IS measurements of energetic protons, and we prescribe criteria for selecting the appropriate method for different scenarios. Our results show that the re-binned intensity is consistently larger (up to a factor of 5) than the spectral binned intensity for two SEP events observed by PSP, although the time series of the two methods are strongly correlated. Overall, both measures are important for SEP spectral analysis, and the selection of the appropriate measure depends on whether a physical (spectral binned intensity) or a statistical (re-binned intensity) representation is needed for a given analysis.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven M Dwarf Model and Detailed Abundances for $\sim$17,000 M Dwarfs in SDSS-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cool temperatures of M dwarf atmospheres enable complex molecular chemistry, making robust characterization of M dwarf compositions a long-standing challenge. Recent modifications to spectral synthesis pipelines have enabled more accurate modeling of M dwarf atmospheres, but these methods are too slow for characterizing more than a handful of stars at a time. Data-driven methods such as The Cannon are viable alternatives, and can harness the information content of many M dwarfs from large spectroscopic surveys. Here, we train The Cannon on M dwarfs with FGK binary companions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper (SDSS-V/MWM), with spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). The FGK-M pairs are assumed to be chemically homogeneous and span $-$0.56 $&lt;$ [Fe/H] $&lt;$ 0.31 dex. The resulting model is capable of inferring M dwarf $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ and elemental abundances for Fe, Mg, Al, Si, C, N, O, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with median uncertainties of 13 K and 0.018$-$0.029 dex, respectively. We test the model by verifying that it reproduces reported abundance values of M dwarfs in open clusters and benchmark M dwarf datasets, as well as expected metallicity trends from stellar evolution. We apply the model to 16,590 M dwarfs in SDSS-V/MWM and provide their detailed abundances in our accompanying catalog.</description>

      <title>Global Heliospheric Termination Shock Strength in the Solar-Interstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heliospheric termination shock (HTS) surrounds our solar system at approximately 100 astronomical units from the Sun, where the expanding solar wind (SW) is compressed and heated before encountering the interstellar medium. HTS-accelerated particles govern the pressure balance with the interstellar medium, but little is known about the HTS's global properties beyond in situ measurements from Voyager in only two directions of the sky. We fill this gap in knowledge with a novel and complex methodology: particle-in-cell, test particle, and MHD simulations, combined with a global minimization scheme to derive global HTS compression ratio sky maps. The methods utilize Interstellar Boundary Explorer observations of energetic neutral atoms produced from HTS-accelerated particles. Our results reveal unique, three-dimensional characteristics, such as higher compression near the poles during solar minimum, north-south asymmetries from the disparate polar coronal holes' evolution, and minimum compression near the flanks likely from SW slowing by mass-loading over a greater distance to the HTS.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Solar Eruption, EUV Wave Propagation, and Wave-Induced Prominence Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) waves, frequently produced by eruptions, propagate through the non-uniform magnetic field of the solar corona and interact with distant prominences, inducing their global oscillations. However, the generation, propagation, and interaction of these waves with distant prominences remain poorly understood. We aim to study the influence of an eruptive flux rope (EFR) on a distant prominence by means of extreme-resolution numerical simulations. We cover a domain of horizontal extent of 1100 Mm while capturing details down to 130 km using automated grid refinement. We performed a 2.5D numerical experiment using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC 3.1 code, modeling an eruption as a 2.5D catastrophe scenario augmented with a distant dipole magnetic field to form the flux rope prominence. Our findings reveal that the EFR becomes unstable and generates a quasicircular front. The primary front produces a slow secondary front when crossing equipartition lines where the Alfv\'en speed is close to the sound speed. The resulting fast and slow EUV waves show different behaviors, with the fast EUV wave slightly decelerating as it propagates through the corona, while the slow EUV wave forms a stationary front. The fast EUV wave interacts with the remote prominence, driving both transverse and longitudinal oscillations. Additionally, magnetic reconnection at a null point below the prominence flux rope is triggered by the fast EUV wave, affecting the flux rope magnetic field and the prominence oscillations. Our study unifies important results of the dynamics of eruptive events and their interactions with distant prominences, including details of (oscillatory) reconnection and chaotic plasmoid dynamics. We demonstrate for the first time the full consequences of remote eruptions on prominence dynamics and clarify the damping mechanisms of prominence oscillations.</description>

      <title>Icarus 3.0: Dynamic Heliosphere Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather predictions are necessary to avoid damage caused by intense geomagnetic storms. Such strong storms are usually caused by a co-rotating interaction region (CIR) passing at Earth or by the arrival of strong coronal mass ejections (CMEs). To mitigate the damage, the effect of propagating CMEs in the solar wind must be estimated accurately at Earth and other locations. Modelling solar wind accurately is crucial for space weather predictions, as it is the medium for CME propagation. The Icarus heliospheric modelling tool is upgraded to handle dynamic inner heliospheric driving instead of using steady boundary conditions. The ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver and the automated grid-adaptivity are adjusted to the latest MPI-AMRVAC version. The inner boundary conditions, prescribed at 0.1 AU for the heliospheric model, are updated time-dependently throughout the simulation. The coronal model is computed repeatedly for selected magnetograms. The particle sampling within MPI-AMRVAC is extended to handle stretched spherical grid information. The solar wind obtained in the simulation is dynamic and shows significant variations throughout the evolution. When comparing the results with the observations, the dynamic solar wind results are more accurate than previous results obtained with purely steady boundary driving. The CMEs propagated through the dynamic solar wind background produce more similar signatures in the time-series data than in the steady solar wind. Dynamic boundary driving in Icarus results in a more self-consistent solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere. The obtained space weather modelling tool for dynamic solar wind and CME simulations is better suited for space weather forecasting than a steady solar wind model.</description>

      <title>Disks around young free-floating planetary-mass objects: Ultradeep Spitzer imaging of IC348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks have been found around free-floating objects with masses comparable to those of giant planets. The frequency and properties of these disks around planetary-mass objects are still debated. Here we present ultradeep mid-infrared images for the young cluster IC348, obtained through stacking of time series images from Spitzer. We measure fluxes at 3.6 and 4.5 microns for known free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs, spectral type M9 or later) in this cluster. By comparing the observed infrared spectral energy distributions with photospheric templates, we identify six planetary-mass objects with disks, plus three which may or may not have a disk. This corresponds to a disk fraction of 46% (34-59%). The disk fraction among planetary-mass objects is comparable to more massive brown dwarfs. We show the disk fraction among free-floating planetary-mass objects as a function of age, demonstrating that these objects retain disks for several million years, similar to low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The prototype double-faced white dwarf has a thin hydrogen layer across its entire surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some white dwarfs undergo significant changes in atmospheric composition owing to the diffusion and mixing of residual hydrogen in a helium-rich envelope. Of particular interest are a few objects exhibiting hydrogen and helium line variations modulated by rotation, revealing surface composition inhomogeneities. Recently, the hot ultramassive white dwarf ZTF J203349.80+322901.1 emerged as the most extreme such specimen, with hydrogen and helium lines successively appearing and vanishing in anti-phase, suggesting a peculiar double-faced configuration. However, standard atmosphere models fail to reproduce the observed spectrum at all rotation phases, hampering further interpretation. Here, we perform a new analysis of ZTF J203349.80+322901.1 using stratified atmosphere models, where hydrogen floats above helium, and obtain excellent fits to the phase-resolved spectra. Our results imply that an extremely thin hydrogen layer covers the entire surface but varies from optically thick to optically thin across the surface, thus producing the observed spectral variations. We present new envelope models indicating that the hydrogen layer arises from a delicate interplay between diffusion and convection. We discuss possible explanations for the surface layer asymmetry, including an asymmetric magnetic field and a non-uniform internal hydrogen distribution. Finally, we highlight implications for expanding and understanding the emerging class of inhomogeneous white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Will nanodust reappear in STEREO/WAVES data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanodust particles produced near the Sun by collisional breakup of larger grains are accelerated in the magnetised solar wind and reach high speeds outwards of 1 AU. Vaporisation and ionisation of fast dust grains impacting a spacecraft produce voltage pulses on wave instruments that enable them to act as dust detectors. Wave instruments on STEREO and on Cassini during its cruise phase detected a highly variable flux of fast nanodust. Both detections took place when the orientation of the solar magnetic dipole produced an interplanetary electric field that focused nanoparticles towards the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) - a geometry that is recurring because of the periodicity of solar activity.</description>

      <title>Location and energy of electrons producing the radio bursts from AD Leo observed by FAST in December 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we presented circularly polarized radio bursts detected by the radio telescope FAST from the flare star AD Leo on December 2-3, 2021, which were attributed to the electron cyclotron maser instability. In that context we use here two independent and complementary approaches\pz{, inspired from the study of auroral radio emissions from solar system planets,} to constrain for the first time the source location (magnetic shell, height) and the energy of the emitting electrons. These two approaches consist of (i) modeling the overall occurrence of the emission with the ExPRES code, and (ii) fitting the drift-rate of the fine structures observed by FAST. We obtain consistent results pointing at 20-30 keV electrons on magnetic shells with apex at 2-10 stellar radii. Emission polarization observed by FAST and magnetic topology of AD Leo favour X-mode emission from the southern magnetic hemisphere, from which we draw constraints on the plasma density scale height in the star's atmosphere. We demonstrate that sensitive radio observations with high time-frequency resolutions, coupled to modelling tools such as ExPRES, analytical calculations and stellar magnetic field measurements, now allow us to remotely probe stellar radio environments.} We provide elements of comparison with solar system radio bursts (Jovian and Solar), emit hypotheses about the driver of AD Leo's radio bursts and discuss the perspectives of future observations, in particular at very low frequencies (&lt;100 MHz).</description>

      <title>Effect of Numerical Resolution on Synthetic Observables of Simulated Coronal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly realistic simulations of the corona are used to predict synthetic observables for instruments onboard both existing and upcoming heliophysics space missions. Synthetic observables play an important role in constraining coronal heating theories. Choosing the spatial resolution of numerical simulations involves a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Since the numerical resolution not only affects the scale of structures that can be resolved, but also thermodynamic quantities such as the average coronal density, it is important to quantify the effect on synthesized observables. Using 3D radiative MHD simulations of coronal loops at three different grid spacings, from 60 km down to 12 km, we find that changes in numerical resolution lead to differences in thermodynamic quantities and stratification as well as dynamic behaviour. Higher grid resolution results in a more complex and dynamic atmosphere. The resolution affects the emission intensity as well as the velocity distribution, thereby affecting synthetic spectra derived from the simulation. The distribution of synthetic coronal loop strand sizes changes as more fine-scale structure is resolved. A number of parameters, however, seem to start to saturate from our chosen medium grid resolution on. Our study shows that while choosing a sufficiently high resolution matters when comparing forward-modelled observables with data from current and future space missions, for most purposes not much is gained by further increasing the resolution beyond a grid spacing of 24 km, which seems to be adequate for reproducing bulk loop properties and forward-modelled emission, representing a good trade-off between accuracy and computational resource.</description>

Abstract: The Sun can efficiently capture leptophilic dark matter that scatters with free electrons. If this dark matter subsequently annihilates into leptonic states, it can produce a detectable neutrino flux. Using 10 years of Super-Kamiokande observations, we set constraints on the dark-matter/electron scattering cross-section that exceed terrestrial direct detection searches by more than an order of magnitude for dark matter masses below 100 GeV, and reach cross-sections as low as $\sim$4$\times$10$^{-41}$cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Black Hole Spin for the X-Ray Binary MAXI J1727-203 Based on Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the spin of the black hole (BH) candidate MAXI J1727-203 using Insight-HXMT data. Due to limited HXMT observations covering only part of the outburst, NICER data were used to analyze the full outburst's state transitions, we identified two of three HXMT observations in the high soft state and applied the continuum-fitting method to measure the spin. Based on previous estimates and continuum spectral fittings, we explored the parameter space and found that the best-fitting values were $(D, i, M) \approx (6\ \text{kpc}, 30^\circ, 12 M_{\odot})$. We also tested the variation of these parameters using Monte Carlo simulations, sampling over 3000 sets within the parameter ranges: $5.9 \text{kpc}&lt; D&lt;7 \text{kpc}$, $24^\circ&lt;i&lt; 35^\circ$, and $10 M_{\odot}&lt;M&lt;14 M_{\odot}$, yielding a spin measurement of $a=0.34_{-0.19}^{+0.15}$ (1$\sigma$). In addition, we analyzed NuSTAR data in low hard state and found a good fit with the {\tt tbabs*(diskbb+powerlaw)} model, with no significant iron line features observed in the residuals, then the previous reflection model results suggesting an extremely high spin would over-estimate the BH spin.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models with phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. We show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as ~10^51 erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Our results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, we predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. We find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.</description>

      <title>Observations of the X-ray Millihertz Quasiperiodic Oscillations in Hercules X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a systematic timing investigation of the persistent X-ray binary pulsar Her X-1 based on a large number of Insight-HXMT observations between 2017 to 2019, we confirm the presence of X-ray millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) at $\sim 0.01$ Hz. By applying wavelet analysis in our data analysis procedures, we firstly identified $\sim 0.005-0.009$ Hz QPOs coexisting with the $\sim 0.01$ Hz QPOs. Wavelet analysis suggests that these QPO features show transient behaviors, frequencies of mHz QPOs evolved in short time scales. There exists a positive relation between QPO centroid frequency (from $\sim 0.005-0.009$ Hz) and the X-ray luminosity, while the 10 mHz QPO frequencies keep nearly constant for different luminosities, which suggests different physical mechanisms for two types of mHz QPOs. The 10 mHz QPOs in both X-ray and UV bands would have the same origin related to the beat frequency where the Alfv$\acute{e}$n radius is close to the corotation radius, and the 5 mHz QPOs may originate from magnetic disk precession.</description>

      <title>Novel Dark Matter Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celestial observations often exhibit inexplicable planetary dependencies when the timing of an observable is projected onto planetary heliocentric positions. This is possible only for incident, non-relativistic streams. Notably, the celebrated dark matter (DM) in the Universe can form streams in our vicinity with speeds of about 240 km/s. Since gravitational impact scales with $1/(\text{velocity})^2$, all solar system objects, including the Sun and the Moon, act as strong gravitational lenses, with their focal planes located within the solar system. Even the Moon can focus penetrating particles toward the Earth at speeds of up to approximately 400 km/s, covering a large portion of the phase space of DM constituents. Consequently, the unexpected planetary dependencies of solar system observables may provide an alternative to Zwicky's tension regarding the overestimated visible cosmic mass. In this work, an overlooked but unexpected planetary dependency of any local observable serves as an analogue to Zwicky's cosmic measurements, particularly if a similar mysterious behavior has been previously noted. Thus, a persistent, unexpected planetary dependency represents a new tension between observation and expectation. The primary argument supporting DM in line with Zwicky's paradigm is this planetary dependency, which, on a local scale, constitutes the novel tension between observation and expectation. In particular, the recurrent planetary dependency of diverse observables mirrors Zwicky's cosmic tension with the overestimated visible mass. No other approach accounts for so many otherwise striking and mysterious observations in physics and medicine.</description>

      <title>Redistribution of ices between grain populations in protostellar envelopes. Only the coldest grains get ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Matter that falls onto a protoplanetary disk (PPD) from a protostellar envelope is heated before it cools again. This induces sublimation and subsequent re-adsorption of ices that accumulated during the prestellar phase. Aims. We explore the fate of ices on multiple-sized dust grains in a parcel of infalling matter. Methods. A comprehensive kinetic chemical model using five grain-size bins with different temperatures was applied for an infalling parcel. The parcel was heated to 150 K and then cooled over a total timescale of 20 kyr. Effects on ice loss and re-accumulation by the changed gas density, the maximum temperature, the irradiation intensity, the size-dependent grain temperature trend, and the distribution of the ice mass among the grain-size bins were investigated. Results. A massive selective redistribution of ices exclusively onto the surface of the coldest grain-size bin occurs in all models. The redistribution starts already during the heating stage, where ices that are sublimated from warmer grains re-adsorb onto colder grains before complete sublimation. During the cooling stage, the sublimated molecules re-freeze again onto the coldest grains. In the case of full sublimation, this re-adsorption is delayed and occurs at lower temperatures because a bare grain surface has lower molecular desorption energies in our model. Conclusions. Most protostellar envelope grains enter the PPD ice poor (bare). Ices are carried by a single coldest grain-size bin, here representing 12 % of the total grain surface area. This bare ice-grain dualism can affect the rate of the grain coagulation. The ice components are stratified on the grains according to their sublimation temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Ophiuchus DIsk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA): Complete Size Distributions for the 100 Brightest Disks Across Multiplicity and SED Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The size of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental property, yet most remain unresolved, even in nearby star-forming regions (d $\sim$ 140-200 pc). We present the complete continuum size distribution for the $105$ brightest protoplanetary disks (M$_{\text{dust}}$ $\gtrsim$ 2 M$_{\oplus}$) in the Ophiuchus cloud, obtained from ALMA Band 8 (410 GHz) observations at 0.05$^{\prime\prime}$ (7 au) to 0.15$^{\prime\prime}$ (21 au) resolution. This sample includes 54 Class II and 51 Class I and Flat Spectrum sources, providing a comprehensive distribution across evolutionary stages. We measure the Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) and the radius encircling $68\%$ of the flux ($R_{68\%}$) for most non-binary disks, yielding the largest flux-limited sample of resolved disks in any star-forming region. The distribution is log-normal with a median value of $\sim$14 au and a logarithmic standard deviation $\sigma_{\log} = 0.46$ (factor of 2.9 in linear scale). Disks in close binary systems ($&lt;$ 200 au separation) have smaller radii, with median value of $\sim$5 au, indicating efficient radial drift as predicted by dust evolution models. The size distribution for young embedded objects (SED Class I and Flat Spectrum, age $\lesssim$ 1 Myr) is similar to that of Class II objects (age $\sim$ a few Myr), implying that pressure bumps must be common at early disk stages to prevent mm-sized particle migration at au scales.</description>

      <title>Evolution of neutron stars in wide eccentric low-mass binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise astrometric measurement with Gaia satellite resulted in the discovery of tens of wide binary systems consisting of a Sun-like star and an invisible component. The latter can be a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. In this paper, we model magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries accounting for the orbital eccentricity. We aim to calculate when neutron stars in such systems can start to accrete matter from the stellar wind of the companion. We show that the transition from the ejector to the propeller stage occurs earlier in more eccentric systems, thus increasing the time that neutron stars can spend accreting matter. Our calculations show that in the case of efficient spin-down at the propeller stage, a neutron star in an eccentric orbit with $e\gtrsim0.6$ and a standard magnetic field $B=10^{12}$ G can start accreting within a few Gyr. For neutron stars with $B=10^{13}$ G the onset of accretion occurs earlier regardless of the orbital eccentricity. Otherwise, with a lower spin-down rate, such a neutron star will remain at the propeller stage for most of its life.</description>

      <title>PRINCESS: Prediction of compact binaries observations with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PRINCESS, a computational tool designed to predict gravitational wave observations from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in current and future detector networks. PRINCESS uniquely combines predictions of both individual gravitational wave events and the associated astrophysical background, leveraging user-provided CBC catalogs. With the anticipated improvements in detector sensitivity from second-generation (2G) to third-generation (3G) observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, the tool aims to constrain models of stellar formation and compact object evolution. PRINCESS calculates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual events and predicts the stochastic background arising from unresolved sources. We detail the code structure, installation, and usage, providing examples of predictions for different astrophysical models and detector configurations. Results include forecasts for binary black hole detections and background spectra, highlighting the potential of future networks to resolve nearly all CBC events. We also discuss ongoing developments to expand PRINCESS's capabilities, including accounting for additional sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and incorporating more advanced detector models.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence of nuclear detonations in white dwarf collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical stability of thermonuclear detonations in 1D accelerated reactive shocks and 2D binary collisions of equal mass, magnetized and unmagnetized white dwarf stars. To achieve high resolution at initiation sites, we devised geometric gridding and mesh velocity strategies specially adapted to the unique requirements of head-on collisional geometries, scenarios in which one expects maximum production of iron-group products. We study effects of grid resolution and the limiting of temperature, energy generation, and reactants for different stellar masses, separations, magnetic fields, initial compositions, detonation mechanisms, and limiter parameters across a range of cell sizes from 1 to 100 km. Our results set bounds on the parameter space of limiter amplitudes for which both temperature and energy limiting procedures yield consistent and monotonically convergent solutions. Within these bounds we find grid resolutions of 5 km or better are necessary for uncertainties in total released energy and iron-group products to drop below 10%. Intermediate mass products (e.g., calcium) exhibit similar convergence trends but with somewhat greater uncertainty. These conclusions apply equally to pure C/O WDs, multi-species compositions (including helium shells), magnetized and unmagnetized cores, and either single or multiple detonation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dissecting stellar populations with manifold learning I. Validation of the method on a synthetic Milky Way-like galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different stellar populations may be identified through differences in chemical, kinematic, and chronological properties, suggesting the interplay of various physical mechanisms that led to their origin and subsequent evolution. As such, the identification of stellar populations is key for gaining insight into the evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. This task is complicated by the fact that stellar populations share significant overlap in their chrono-chemo-kinematic properties, hindering efforts to identify and define stellar populations. Our goal is to offer a novel and effective methodology that can provide deeper insight into the nonlinear and nonparametric properties of the multidimensional physical parameters that define stellar populations. For this purpose we explore the ability of manifold learning to differentiate stellar populations with minimal assumptions about their number and nature. Manifold learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique that seeks to intelligently identify and disentangle manifolds hidden within the input data. To test this method, we make use of Gaia DR3-like synthetic stellar samples generated from the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations. These represent red-giant stars constrained by asteroseismic data from TESS. We reduce the 5-dimensional input chrono-chemo-kinematic parameter space into 2-dimensional latent space embeddings generated by manifold learning. We then study these embeddings to assess how accurately they represent the original data and whether they contain meaningful information that can be used to discern stellar populations. We conclude that manifold learning possesses promising abilities to differentiate stellar populations when considering realistic observational constraints.</description>

Abstract: We continue examining statistical data assimilation (SDA), an inference methodology, to infer solutions to neutrino flavor evolution, for the first time using real - rather than simulated - data. The model represents neutrinos streaming from the Sun's center and undergoing a Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance in flavor space, due to the radially-varying electron number density. The model neutrino energies are chosen to correspond to experimental bins in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and Borexino experiments, which measure electron-flavor survival probability at Earth. The procedure successfully finds consistency between the observed fluxes and the model, if the MSW resonance - that is, flavor evolution due to solar electrons - is included in the dynamical equations representing the model.</description>

      <title>Variability in hot sub-luminous stars and binaries: Machine-learning analysis of Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot sub-luminous stars represent a population of stripped and evolved red giants that is located on the extreme horizontal branch. Since they exhibit a wide range of variability due to pulsations or binary interactions, it is crucial to unveil their intrinsic and extrinsic variability to understand the physical processes of their formation. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, they overlap with interacting binaries such as cataclysmic variables (CVs). By leveraging the most recent clustering algorithm tools, we investigate the variability of 1,576 candidate hot subdwarf variables using comprehensive data from Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations. We present a novel approach that uses the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding and the uniform manifold approximation and projection dimensionality reduction algorithms to facilitate the identification and classification of different populations of variable hot subdwarfs and CVs in a large dataset. In addition to the publicly available Gaia time-series statistics table, we adopted additional statistical features that enhanced the performance of the algorithms. The clustering results led to the identification of 85 new hot subdwarf variables based on Gaia and TESS light curves and of 108 new variables based on Gaia light curves alone, including reflection-effect systems, HW Vir, ellipsoidal variables, and high-amplitude pulsating variables. A significant number of known CVs (140) distinctively cluster in the 2D feature space among an additional 152 objects that we consider candidates for new CVs. This study paves the way for more efficient and comprehensive analyses of stellar variability from ground- and space-based observations, and for the application of machine-learning classifications of candidate variable stars in large surveys.</description>

Abstract: Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations provide valuable insights into the plasma conditions in the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium. Unlike plasma detectors, which measure charged particles tied to the magnetic fields at their location, ENA detectors capture former ions that were neutralized in distant regions and traverse the heliosphere in straight trajectories. ENA fluxes near the Sun represent line-of-sight integrals of parent ion fluxes multiplied by neutralization (production) rates and reduced by the probability of ENA reionization (loss) processes. So far, most ENA analyses have focused on charge exchange between hydrogen atoms and protons as the primary source of ENAs. Here, we examine various ENA production and loss processes throughout the heliosphere in the broad energy range (5 eV to 500 keV) encompassing the next-generation ENA instruments aboard the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission. Our study considers binary collisions involving the most abundant species: protons, electrons, {\alpha}-particles, He+ ions, photons, as well as hydrogen and helium atoms. Our findings indicate that, in addition to ENAs produced by charge exchange of energetic protons with hydrogen atoms, a significant portion of high-energy ENAs originate from the charge exchange with helium atoms. Below 10 keV, the dominant ENA loss processes are charge exchange collisions with protons and photoionization. However, stripping ionization processes, e.g., from collisions with ambient interstellar neutral hydrogen, become the main loss mechanism for higher energies because the charge exchange rate rapidly decreases.</description>

      <title>Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets in realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>

Abstract: Context. The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017 confirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the surrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the outflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission. Aims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. Our goal is to extend a (specific) jet simulation in 3D up to a nearly ballistic phase, analysing the overall dynamical evolution from the jet breakout. Methods. Our work is based on a previous 3D magnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported from a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time originally covered. After approximately 3 seconds of the jet evolution on the original spherical grid, we remap the system into a uniform Cartesian grid and reach about 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Results. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in a rather asymmetrical emerging outflow with relatively low Lorentz factor. The analysis of the energy conversion processes and corresponding acceleration shows that at the end of our simulation 98% of the energy is in kinetic form. Moreover, at that time the angular structure is frozen. We thus obtain suitable inputs for...</description>
