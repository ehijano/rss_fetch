      <title>Contrasting the relative performance of RF photonic transversal signal processors based on microcombs using discrete components versus integrated devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RF photonic transversal signal processors, which combine reconfigurable electrical digital signal processing and high-bandwidth photonic processing, provide a powerful solution for achieving adaptive high-speed information processing. Recent progress in optical microcomb technology provides compelling multi-wavelength sources with compact footprint, yielding a variety of microcomb-based RF photonic transversal signal processors implemented by either discrete or integrated components. Although operating based on the same principle, processors in these two forms exhibit distinct performance. This letter presents a comparative investigation into their performance. First, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art processors, focusing on the processing accuracy. Next, we analyze various factors that contribute to the performance differences, including tap number and imperfect response of experimental components. Finally, we discuss the potential for future improvement. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of microcomb based RF photonic transversal signal processors implemented using discrete and integrated components and provide insights for their future development.</description>

      <title>Thermal investigation of bistability in high index doped silica integrated ring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization and engineering of thermo-optic effects have found broad applications in integrated photonic devices, facilitating efficient light manipulation to achieve various functionalities. Here, we perform both an experimental characterization and theoretical analysis of these effects in integrated micro-ring resonators in high index doped silica (HIDS), which has had many applications in integrated photonics and nonlinear optics. By fitting the experimental results with theory, we obtain fundamental parameters that characterize their thermo-optic performance, including the thermo-optic coefficient, the efficiency for the optically induced thermo-optic process, and the thermal conductivity. The characteristics of these parameters are compared to those of other materials commonly used for integrated photonic platforms, such as silicon, silicon nitride, and silica. These results offer a comprehensive insight into the thermo-optic properties of HIDS based devices. Understanding these properties is essential for efficiently controlling and engineering them in many practical applications.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Tailored Light-Matter Coupling in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric structures can support low-absorption optical modes, which are attractive for engineering light-matter interactions with excitonic resonances in two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the coupling strength is often limited by the electromagnetic field being confined inside the dielectric, reducing spatial overlap with the active excitonic material. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for enhanced light-matter coupling by embedding excitonic tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) within dielectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), forming a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that optimizes the field overlap and alignment between excitons and optical waveguide modes. To tailor diffractive coupling between free-space light and the waveguide modes in the vdW heterostructure, we fabricate Fourier surfaces in the top hBN layer using thermal scanning-probe lithography and etching, producing sinusoidal topographic landscapes with nanometer precision. We observe the formation of exciton-polaritons with a Rabi splitting indicating that the system is at the onset of strong coupling. These results demonstrate the potential of Fourier-tailored vdW heterostructures for exploring advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of Lugiato-Lefever equation for Kerr combs generation in Fabry-Perot resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with damping, detuning and driving terms, introduced as a model for Kerr combs generation in ring-shape resonators and more recently, in the form of a variant, in Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators. The aim of this paper is to present some numerical methods that complement each other to solve the LLE in its general form both in the dynamic and in the steady state regimes. We also provide some mathematical properties of the LLE likely to help the understanding and interpretation of the numerical simulation results.</description>

      <title>A plug-and-play solution for characterizing two-way optical frequency transfer over free-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical clock networks connected by phase-coherent links offer significant potential for advancing fundamental research and diverse scientific applications. Free-space optical frequency transfer extends fiber-based connectivity to remote areas and holds the potential for global coverage via satellite links. Here we present a compact and robust portable, rack-integrated two-way free-space link characterization system. Equipped with plug-and-play capabilities, the system enables straightforward interfacing with various optical systems and facilitates quick deployment for field experiments. In this work, we achieve a fractional frequency instability of $2.0 \times 10^{-19}$ for an averaging time of 10 s over a 3.4 km horizontal fully folded intra-city free-space link. Moreover, the system maintains an uptime of $94\%$ over 15 hours, illustrating its reliability and effectiveness for high-precision optical frequency comparisons over free-space.</description>

      <title>Dynamically reconfigurable multi-wavelength interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-wavelength interferometry achieves high resolution for smooth surfaces but struggles with rough, industrially relevant ones due to limited unambiguous measuring range and speckle effects. Multi-wavelength interferometry addresses these challenges by using synthetic waveleths, enabling a balance between extended measurement range and resolution by combining several synthetic wavelengths. This approach holds immense potential for diverse industrial applications, yet it remains largely untapped due to the lack of suitable light sources. Existing solutions are constrained by limited flexibility in synthetic-wavelength generation and slow switching speeds. We demonstrate a light source for multi-wavelength interferometry based on electro-optic single-sideband modulation. It reliably generates synthetic wavelengths with arbitrary values from centimeters to meters and switching times below 30 ms. This breakthrough paves the way for dynamic, reconfigurable multi-wavelength interferometry capable of adapting to complex surfaces and operating efficiently even outside laboratory settings. These capabilities unlock the full potential of multi-wavelength interferometry, offering unprecedented flexibility and speed for industrial and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of Directional Couplers with Oxide Cladding: Bridging Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional couplers are a fundamental building block in integrated photonics, particularly in quantum applications and optimization-based design where precision is critical. Accurate functionality is crucial to ensure reliable operation within classical and quantum circuits. However, discrepancies between simulations and measurements are frequently observed. These inaccuracies can compromise the performance and scalability of integrated photonic systems, underscoring the critical need for advanced, precise simulation methods that bridge the gap between design and implementation. In this work, we show that this discrepancy can be mainly attributed to density changes in the oxide cladding. We conduct a systematic study involving experimental optical measurements, numerical simulations, and direct electron microscopy imaging to investigate this discrepancy in directional couplers. We find that the impact of cladding density variations on performance increases as feature gaps shrink. By incorporating these effects into our simulations using a novel and physically motivated Effective Trench Medium Model (ETMM), we achieve highly accurate reproduction of experimental measurements. We quantify the effects of cladding density variations on the SU(2) symmetry parameters that govern light propagation in directional couplers. This insight is crucial for advancing the precision of compact device fabrication, enabling reliable simulation of photonic integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Signatures of cubic gravity in the strong regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Einsteinian cubic gravity in the strong gravitational regime. In the first part, we explore analytical solutions for a static, spherically symmetric metric, establishing the existence of maximally symmetric de Sitter solutions, as well as asymptotically de Sitter solutions, with an effective cosmological constant. We also study, analytically and numerically, how the horizon properties are affected by cubic gravity. Our results reveal that a positive coupling constant reduces the horizon size, while a negative one increases it. In the second part, we analyze potential observational signatures of cubic terms, focusing on their effects on the bending of light. Specifically, we investigate the angular difference, related to the deflection angle but valid near the source, along with the behavior of the photon sphere. Our findings show that the strongest effects of the cubic terms occur in the strong gravity regime, and there exists a direct relationship between the value of the coupling constant and the photon sphere position, opening up the possibility to constrain cubic gravity with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Technical description and performance of the phase II version of the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) is a series of upgrades for the Keck II Adaptive Optics (AO) system and the NIRSPEC spectrograph to enable diffraction limited, high resolution (R&gt;30000) spectroscopy of exoplanets and low mass companions in the K and L bands. Phase I consisted of single mode fiber injection/extraction units (FIU/FEU) used in conjunction with a H band pyramid wavefront sensor. The use of single mode fibers provides a gain in stellar rejection, a substantial reduction in sky background, and an extremely stable line spread function in the spectrograph. Phase II, deployed and commissioned in 2022, brought a 1000 actuator deformable mirror, beam shaping optics, a vortex mask, and other upgrades to the FIU/FEU. An additional service mission in 2024 extended operations down to y band, delivered an atmospheric dispersion corrector, and provided access to two laser frequency combs. KPIC phase II brings higher planet throughput, lower stellar leakage and many new observing modes which extend its ability to characterize exoplanets at high spectral resolution, building on the success of phase I. In this paper we present a description of the final phase II version of KPIC, along with results of system level laboratory testing and characterization showing the instrument's phase II throughput, stability, repeatability, and other key performance metrics prior to delivery and during installation at Keck. We outlined the capabilities of the various observing modes enabled by the new modules as well as efforts to compensate for static aberrations and non common path errors at Keck, which were issues that plagued phase I. Finally, we show results from commissioning.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analysis of large-space and long-time asymptotics for the short-pulse soliton gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the asymptotics of soliton gases to the short-pulse (SP) equation. The soliton gas is formulated in terms of a RH problem, which is derived from the RH problems of the $N$-soliton solutions with $N \to \infty$. Building on prior work in the study of the KdV soliton gas and orthogonal polynomials with Jacobi-type weights, we extend the reflection coefficient to two generalized forms on the interval $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]$: $r_0(\lambda) = \left(\lambda - \eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2 - \lambda\right)^{\beta_2}|\lambda - \eta_0|^{\beta_0}\gamma(\lambda)$, $r_c(\lambda) = \left(\lambda - \eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2 - \lambda\right)^{\beta_2}\chi_c(\lambda)\gamma(\lambda)$, where $0 &lt; \eta_1 &lt; \eta_0 &lt; \eta_2$ and $\beta_j &gt; -1$ ($j = 0, 1, 2$), $\gamma(\lambda)$ is continuous and positive on $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]$, with an analytic extension to a neighborhood of this interval, $\chi_c(\lambda) = 1$ for $\lambda \in \left[\eta_1, \eta_0\right)$ and $\chi_c(\lambda) = c^2$ for $\lambda \in \left(\eta_0, \eta_2\right]$, where $c&gt;0$ with $c \neq 1$. The asymptotic analysis is performed using the steepest descent method. A key aspect of the analysis is the construction of the $g$-function. To address the singularity at the origin, we introduce an innovative piecewise definition of $g$-function. To establish the order of the error term, we construct local parametrices near $\eta_j$ for $j = 1, 2$, and singularity $\eta_0$. At the endpoints, we employ the Airy parametrix and the first type of modified Bessel parametrix. At the singularity $\eta_0$, we use the second type of modified Bessel parametrix for $r_0$ and confluent hypergeometric parametrix for $r_c(\lambda)$.</description>

      <title>Frequency auto-homogenization using group-velocity-matched downconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the stability of integrated photonics at network nodes and the advantages of photons as flying qubits, photonic quantum information processing (PQIP) makes quantum networks increasingly scalable. However, scaling up PQIP requires the preparation of many identical single photons which is limited by the spectral distinguishability of integrated single-photon sources due to variations in fabrication or local environment. To address this, we introduce frequency auto-homogenization via group-velocity-matched downconversion to remove spectral distinguishability in varying quantum emitters. We present our theory using $\chi^{(2)}$ quantum frequency conversion and show proof-of-principle data in a free-space optical setup.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum magnetometry with a laser-written integrated photonic diamond chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond can act as a precise quantum sensor even under ambient conditions. In particular, to optimize thier sensitivity, it is crucial to increase the number of spins sampled and maximize their coupling to the detection system, without degrading their spin properties. In this paper, we demonstrate enhanced quantum magnetometry via a high-quality buried laser-written waveguide in diamond with a 4.5 ppm density of nitrogen-vacancy centers. We show that the waveguide-coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers exhibit comparable spin coherence properties as that of nitrogen-vacancy centers in pristine diamond using time-domain optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Waveguide-enhanced magnetic field sensing is demonstrated in a fiber-coupled integrated photonic chip, where probing an increased volume of high-density spins results in 63 pT.Hz$^{-1/2}$ of DC-magnetic field sensitivity and 20 pT.Hz$^{-1/2}$ of AC magnetic field sensitivity. This on-chip sensor realizes at least an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the conventional confocal detection setup, paving the way for microscale sensing with nitrogen-vacancy ensembles.</description>

      <title>Influence of the growth temperature and annealing on the optical properties of {CdO/ZnO}30 superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical properties of the short period {CdO/ZnO} superlattices grown by plasma assisted MBE were analyzed. The superlattice (SLs) structures were successfully obtained at different growth temperatures from 360 to 550 {\deg}C. Interestingly, the growth temperature of the SLs influences quality of multilayers and also optical properties of these structures. After annealing at 900{\deg}C by rapid thermal method various defect luminescence located at different energetic positions , were detected, and intensity of luminescence strongly depends on applied growth temperature.</description>

      <title>Electronic superradiance mediated by nuclear dynamics</title>

Abstract: Superradiance, in which the collective behavior of emitters can generate enhanced radiative decay, was first predicted by a model, now known as the Dicke model, that contains a collection of two-level systems (the emitters) all interacting with the same photonic mode. In this article, we extend the original Dicke model to elucidate the influence of nuclear motion on superradiant emission. Our dynamical simulations of the combined electronic, nuclear, and photonic system reveal a new time scale attributed to the population leakage of the dark, subradiant states. Furthermore, this dark state emission pathway can be controlled by tuning the nuclear potential energy landscape. These findings impact how superradiant states and molecular degrees of freedom can be leveraged and utilized in quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Coherence Awareness in Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffractive neural networks hold great promise for applications requiring intensive computational processing. Considerable attention has focused on diffractive networks for either spatially coherent or spatially incoherent illumination. Here we illustrate that, as opposed to imaging systems, in diffractive networks the degree of spatial coherence has a dramatic effect. In particular, we show that when the spatial coherence length on the object is comparable to the minimal feature size preserved by the optical system, neither the incoherent nor the coherent extremes serve as acceptable approximations. Importantly, this situation is inherent to many settings involving active illumination, including reflected light microscopy, autonomous vehicles and smartphones. Following this observation, we propose a general framework for training diffractive networks for any specified degree of spatial and temporal coherence, supporting all types of linear and nonlinear layers. Using our method, we numerically optimize networks for image classification, and thoroughly investigate their performance dependence on the illumination coherence properties. We further introduce the concept of coherence-blind networks, which have enhanced resilience to changes in illumination conditions. Our findings serve as a steppingstone toward adopting all-optical neural networks in real-world applications, leveraging nothing but natural light.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optics in 2D materials: from classical to quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has long been a cornerstone of modern photonic technology, enabling a wide array of applications, from frequency conversion to the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light-matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations such as electrons, excitons, and photons in low dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>GHz fundamental mode-locking of a highly integrated Er-doped all-fiber ring laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High repetition rate ultrafast fiber lasers are important tools for both fundamental science and industry applications. However, achieving over GHz repetition rate in passively mode-locked fiber ring lasers is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate the first ring-cavity Er-doped fiber laser that achieves over GHz fundamental repetition rate by using an all-integration cavity design. In the proposed laser oscillator, all functions are integrated into one device, making it an ultra-compact laser cavity. The laser is mode-locked by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film that is directly deposited on the pigtail active fiber connectors. The laser produces ultrafast optical pulses at 1562 nm, with a pulse width of 682 fs and a fundamental repetition rate of 1.028 GHz with improved performance. Stable and low-noise mode-locking is characterized by high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radiofrequency signal and low relative intensity noise (RIN). The proposed all-integration laser design may serve as a reference for compact fiber ring lasers using other mode-locking mechanisms or at diverse wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Optical manifestations and bounds of topological Euler class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting nontrivial Euler class, a multigap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to dc conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multiband invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Logarithmically complex rigorous Fourier space solution to the 1D grating diffraction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rigorous solution to the grating diffraction problem is a cornerstone step in many scientific fields and industrial applications ranging from the study of the fundamental properties of metasurfaces to the simulation of photolithography masks. Fourier space methods, such as the Fourier Modal Method, are established tools for the analysis of the electromagnetic properties of periodic structures, but are too computationally demanding to be directly applied to large and multiscale optical structures. This work focuses on pushing the limits of rigorous computations of periodic electromagnetic structures by adapting a powerful tensor compression technique called the Tensor Train decomposition. We have found that the millions and billions of numbers produced by standard discretization schemes are inherently excessive for storing the information about diffraction problems required for computations with a given accuracy, and we show how to adapt the TT algorithms to have a logarithmically growing amount of information to be sufficient for reliable rigorous solution of the Maxwell's equations on an example of large period multiscale 1D grating structures.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear skin modes and fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with asymmetrical couplings and various type of nonlinearities to study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect. Our focus is on the exploration of nonlinear skin modes through a fixed-point perspective. The nonlinear interactions are shown to have no impact on the spectral region in the semi-infinite system; however, they induce considerable changes when boundaries are present. The spectrum under open boundary conditions is found not to be a subset of the corresponding spectrum under the semi-infinite boundary conditions. We identify distinctive features of nonlinear skin modes, such as degeneracy, and power-energy discontinuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a family of localized modes that are neither skin nor scale-free localized modes is formed with the introduction of a coupling impurity. Additionally, we show that an impurity can induce discrete dark and anti-dark solitons.</description>

      <title>Molecular tuning of excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, formed by stacking monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, create interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by their fixed covalent lattices. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as precise control of functional groups enables tunable 2D molecular lattices and, consequently, electronic structures. Here, we report molecular tuning of lattices and excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), synthesized as monolayers of perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single crystals. In HBCs, we observe an anisotropic photoluminescence signal exhibiting characteristics of both molecular and TMD excitons, directly tuned by molecular geometry and HBC composition. Ab initio calculations reveal that this anisotropic emission arises from hybrid excitons, which inherit properties from both layers through a hybridized bilayer band structure. Our work establishes a synthetically derived, molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform with the potential for engineering interlayer potentials.</description>
