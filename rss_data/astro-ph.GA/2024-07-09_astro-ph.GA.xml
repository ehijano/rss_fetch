      <title>Should zeros count? Modeling the galaxy-globular cluster scaling relation with(out) zero-inflated count models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling relation between the size of a galaxy's globular cluster (GC) population ($N_{GC}$) and the galaxy's stellar mass ($M_*$) is usually described with a continuous, linear model, but in reality it is a count relationship that should be modeled as such. For massive galaxies, a negative binomial (NB) model has been shown to describe the data well, but it is unclear how the scaling relation behaves at low galaxy masses where a substantial portion of galaxies have $N_{GC}=0$. In this work, we test the utility of Poisson and NB models for describing the low-mass end of the $N_{GC}-M_*$ scaling relation. We introduce the use of zero-inflated versions of these models, which allow for larger zero populations (e.g. galaxies without GCs) than would otherwise be predicted. We evaluate our models with a variety of predictive model comparison methods, including predictive intervals, leave-one-out cross-validation criterion, and posterior predictive comparisons. We find that the NB model is consistent with our data, but the naive Poisson is not. Moreover, we find that zero inflation of the models is not necessary to describe the population of low-mass galaxies that lack GCs, suggesting that a single formation and evolutionary process acts over all galaxy masses. Under the NB model, there does not appear to be anything unique about the lack of GCs in many low-mass galaxies; they are simply the low-mass extension of the larger $N_{GC}-M_*$ scaling relation.</description>

      <title>The SLACS strong lens sample, debiased</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing observations can provide extremely valuable information on the structure of galaxies, but their interpretation is made difficult by selection effects, which, if not accounted for, introduce a bias between the properties of strong lens galaxies and those of the general population. A rigorous treatment of the strong lensing bias requires, in principle, to fully forward model the lens selection process. However, doing so for existing lens surveys is prohibitively difficult. With this work we propose a practical solution to the problem: using an empirical model to capture the most complex aspects of the lens finding process, and constraining it directly from the data together with the properties of the lens population. We applied this method to real data from the SLACS sample of strong lenses. Assuming a power-law density profile, we recovered the mass distribution of the parent population of galaxies from which the SLACS lenses were drawn. We found that early-type galaxies with a stellar mass of $\log{M_*/M_\odot}=11.3$ and average size have a median projected mass enclosed within a $5$~kpc aperture of $\log{M_5/M_\odot}=11.332\pm0.013$, and an average logarithmic density slope of $\gamma=1.99\pm0.03$. These values are respectively $0.02$~dex and $0.1$ lower than inferred when ignoring selection effects. According to our model, most of the bias is due to the prioritisation of SLACS follow-up observations based on the measured velocity dispersion. As a result, the strong lensing bias in $\gamma$ reduces to $\sim0.01$ when controlling for stellar velocity dispersion.</description>

      <title>Challenging the AGN scenario for JWST/NIRSpec broad H$\alpha$ emitters/Little Red Dots in light of non-detection of NIRCam photometric variability and X-ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-$z$ ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies exhibiting broad H$\alpha$ emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding $1,000$~km~s$^{-1}$. This population includes a subset known as 'Little Red Dots', characterized by their compact morphology and extremely red rest-frame optical colors. If all of these broad H$\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of five JWST broad H$\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\lambda_{\text{rest}} \sim 1,500-9,000$\AA\ has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep {\it Chandra} data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.</description>

      <title>Metals in Star-Forming Galaxies with KCWI. I. Methodology and First Results on the Abundances of Iron, Magnesium, and Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the chemical enrichment of different elements is crucial to gaining a complete picture of galaxy chemical evolution. In this study, we present a new sample of 46 low-redshift, low-mass star-forming galaxies at $M_*\sim 10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$ along with two quiescent galaxies at $M_*\sim 10^{8.8}M_{\odot}$ observed with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI), aiming to investigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in the transition zone between Local Group satellites and massive field galaxies. We develop a novel method to simultaneously determine stellar abundances of iron and magnesium in star-forming galaxies. With the gas-phase oxygen abundance (O/H)$_{\rm g}$ measured using the strong line method, we are able to make the first-ever apples-to-apples comparison of $\alpha$ elements in the stars and the ISM. We find that the [Mg/H]$_*$-[O/H]$_{\rm g}$ relation is much tighter than the [Fe/H]$_*$-[O/H]$_{\rm g}$ relation, which can be explained by the similar production processes of $\alpha$ elements. Most galaxies in our sample exhibit higher [O/H]$_{\rm g}$ than [Fe/H]$_*$ and [Mg/H]$_*$. In addition, we construct mass-metallicity relations (MZRs) measured as three different elements (Fe$_*$, Mg$_*$, O$_{\rm g}$). Compared to the gas O-MZR, the stellar Fe- and Mg-MZRs show larger scatter driven by variations in specific star formation rates (sSFR), with star-forming galaxies exhibiting higher sSFR and lower stellar abundances at fixed mass. The excess of [O/H]$_{\rm g}$ compared to stellar abundances as well as the anti-correlation between sSFR and stellar abundance suggests that galaxy quenching of intermediate-mass galaxies at $M_*\sim 10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$ is primarily driven by starvation.</description>

      <title>Electron density distribution in HII regions in IC10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the [OIII]52{\mu}m map of the dwarf galaxy IC10, obtained with the Field-Imaging Far-Infrared Line Spectrometer (FIFI-LS) on board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). We combine the [OIII]52{\mu}m map with Herschel and Spitzer observations, to estimate the electron density distribution of the brightest HII regions of IC10. We find that the line ratio [OIII]88{\mu}m/[OIII]52{\mu}m gives electron density (n_e) values (n_e_OIII) that cover a broad range, while the n_e values obtained using the line ratio [SIII]33{\mu}m/[SIII]18{\mu}m (n_e_SIII) are all similar within the uncertainties. n_e_OIII is similar to n_e_SIII for the M1, M2 and A1 regions, and it is higher than n_e_SIII for the two regions, A2 and M1b, which are the brightest in the 24{\mu}m continuum emission. These results suggest that for these regions the two ions, O++ and S++, trace two different ionised gas components, and that the properties of the ionised gas component traced by the O++ ion are more sensitive to the local physical conditions. In fact, while the gas layer traced by [SIII] does not keep track of the characteristics of the radiation field, the n_e_OIII, correlates with the star formation rate (SFR), the dust temperature and the 24{\mu}m. Therefore, n_e_OIII is an indicator of the evolutionary stage of the HII region and the radiation field, with higher n_e_OIII, found in younger SF regions and in more energetic environments.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations and redshift dependence of the correlation between infrared and radio luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the difference in infrared-to-radio luminosity ratio between local and high-redshift star-forming galaxies reflects {the alternative physical conditions} -- including magnetic field configurations -- of the dominant population of star-forming galaxies in different redshift ranges. We define three galactic types, based on our reference model, with reference to ages of stellar populations. ``Normal'' late-type galaxies dominate the star formation in the nearby Universe; ``starburst'' galaxies take over at higher redshifts, up to z ~1.5; while ``protospheroidal'' galaxies dominate at high redshift. A reanalysis of data from the COSMOS field combined with literature results shows that, for each population, the data are consistent with an almost redshift-independent mean value of the parameter q_IR, which quantifies the infrared-radio correlation. However, we find a hint of an upturn of the mean q_IR at z&gt;~3.5 consistent with the predicted dimming of synchrotron emission due to cooling of relativistic electrons by inverse Compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background. The typical stellar masses increase from normal, to starburst, and to protospheroidal galaxies, accounting for the reported dependence of the mean q_IR on stellar mass. Higher values of q_IR found for high-z strongly lensed dusty galaxies selected at 500 micron might be explained by differential magnification.</description>

      <title>Spiral Magnetic Field and Their Role on Accretion Dynamics in the Circumnuclear Disk of Sagittarius A*: Insight from {\lambda} = 850 {\mu}m Polarization Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We showcase a study on the physical properties of the Circumnuclear Disk surrounding the Sgr A* of the Galactic Center, emphasizing the role of magnetic field (B field) with 0.47 pc spatial resolution, based on the sensitive {\lambda} = 850 {\mu}m polarization data taken with the JCMT. The B field within the CND exhibits a coherent spiral pattern. Applying the model described by Wardle and Ko\ddot{o}nigl 1990 (WK model) to the observed B field pattern, it favors gas-pressure-dominant models without dismissing a gas-and-B field comparable model, leading us to estimate the B-field strength in the ionized cavity around Sgr A* as 0.24 + 0.05 mG. Analysis -0.04 based on the WK model further allows us to derive representative B-field strengths for the radial, azimuthal, and vertical components as (Br,B{\phi},Bz) = (0.4 \pm 0.1,-0.7 \pm 0.2,0.2 \pm 0.05) mG, respectively. A key finding is that the |{\phi}| component is dominant over Br and Bz components, consistent with the spiral morphology, indicating that the CND' s B-field is predominantly toroidal, possibly shaped by accretion dynamics. Considering the turbulent pressure, estimated plasma \{beta} values indicate the effective gas pressure should surpass the magnetic pressure. Assessing the CND of our MWG in the toroidal-and-vertical stability parameter space, we propose that such an "effective" magnetoro-tational instability (MRI) may likely be active. The estimated maximum unstable wavelength, {\lambda}max = 0.1 \pm 0.1 pc, is smaller than the CND' s scale height (0.2 \pm 0.1 pc), which indicates the potential for the effective MRI intermittent cycles of \sim 10^{6} years, which should profoundly affect the CND's evolution, considering the estimated mass accretion rate of 10^{-2}M_{\odot} yr^{-1} to the Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Dust in Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a ubiquitous population of "little red dots" (LRDs) at $z\gtrsim4$, selected via their red rest-frame optical emission and compact morphologies. They are thought to be reddened by dust, whether in tori of active galactic nuclei or the interstellar medium (ISM), though none have direct dust detections to date. Informed by the average characteristics of 675 LRDs drawn from the literature, we provide ballpark constraints on the dust characteristics of the LRD population and estimate they have average dust masses of $\langle M_{dust}\rangle=(1.6^{+4.8}_{-0.9})\times10^{4}$ M$_\odot$, luminosities of $\langle L_{IR}\rangle = (8^{+3}_{-5})\times10^{10}$ L$_\odot$ and temperatures of $\langle T_{dust}\rangle = 110^{+21}_{-36}$ K. Notably, the spectral energy distributions are thought to peak at $\sim$100 K (rest-frame 20-30$\mu m$) regardless of heating mechanism, whether AGN or star formation. Our predictions likely mean LRDs have, on average, submillimeter emission a factor of $\sim$100$\times$ fainter than current ALMA limits provide. If one assumes LRDs' rest-optical light is dominated by stars, the star-to-dust ratio is a factor of $\sim$100$\times$ larger than expected from dust formation models; this suggests LRDs' stellar masses may be significantly overestimated. Despite their high apparent volume density, LRDs contribute negligibly (0.1%) to the cosmic dust budget at $z\gtrsim4$ due to their low dust masses.</description>

      <title>First Results from the Dragonfly Ultrawide Survey: the Largest Eleven Quenched Diffuse Dwarf Galaxies in 3100 deg$^2$ with Spectroscopic Confirmation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dragonfly Telephoto Array employs a unique design to detect very large and diffuse galaxies, which might be missed with conventional telescopes. The Dragonfly Ultrawide Survey (DFUWS) is a new wide-field survey which will cover 10,000 deg$^2$ of the northern sky, and it provides an ideal dataset to find these large diffuse galaxies. From 3100 deg$^2$ of DFUWS data, we identified eleven large, low surface brightness galaxies as a pilot sample for spectroscopic follow-up. These are the largest galaxies in the examined area that appear smooth and isolated, with effective radii of 12"-27". Eight are below 24 $\mathrm{mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$ in central $g$-band surface brightness. Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) spectra of the diffuse light show that all eleven galaxies in this sample are quiescent, and seven qualify as ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Eight galaxies have distances between 15 and 30 Mpc, while the other three are in the Pegasus cluster at 50 Mpc. Their spectra show evidence of a $\sim 1$Gyr old stellar population in addition to an even older stellar population. The intermediate-age component is present in group and satellite galaxies but not in the Pegasus cluster UDGs. All galaxies in this sample are detected in both Dragonfly and Legacy imaging, and the sample partially overlaps with existing UDG catalogs. This pilot sample provides an excellent training set for our analysis of the upcoming full 10,000 deg$^2$ DFUWS data, from which we may expect to discover even larger, previously-unknown galaxies.</description>

      <title>A natural explanation of the VPOS from multistate Scalar Field Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with the Gaia satellite have confirmed that the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) are not distributed as homogeneously as expected. The same occurs in galaxies such as Andromeda and Centaurus A, where satellite galaxies around their host galaxies have been observed to have orbits aligned perpendicular to the galactic plane of the host galaxy. This problem is known as Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) for the MW. The Scalar Field Dark Matter Field (SFDM), also known as Ultralight-, Fuzzy-, BEC-, Axion-dark matter, proposes that DM is a scalar field (SF), which in the non-relativistic limit follows the Schr\"odinger equation coupled to the Poisson equation. Although the SF here is classical, the Schr\"odinger equation contains a ground and excited states as part of its nature. In this work, we show that such quantum character of the SFDM can naturally explain the VPOS observed in galaxies. By taking into account the finite temperature corrections for a complex, self-interacting SF at very early epochs of the Universe, we show that the resulting ground and first excited states only, we can fit the rotation curves of the galaxies in a very simple way, and with the best-fit parameters obtained, we can explain the VPOS. We do this with particular galaxies, such as the MW, M31, Centaurus A, and other six galaxies whose satellites have been observed. From this result, it follows that the multistate SFDM is not distributed homogeneously around the galaxy, and therefore might explain the anisotropic distribution of the satellite galaxies. According to this result, this could be a general characteristic of the galaxies in the Universe. Finally, we also show how the scale of each galaxy depends on a parameter that is determined by the final temperature of the SF of the galaxy halo under study. This explains why different galaxies with SFDM give different values of the mass of the SF.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in star forming environments: how does field strength affect gas on spiral arm and cloud scales?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate star formation from subparsec to kpc scales with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of a cloud structure and a section of galactic spiral arm. We aim to understand how magnetic fields affect star formation, cloud formation and how feedback couples with magnetic fields on scales of clouds and clumps. We find that magnetic fields overall suppress star formation by $\sim$10% with a weak field (5 $\mu$G), and $\sim50$% with a stronger field (50 $\mu$G). Cluster masses are reduced by about 40% with a strong field but show little change with a weak field. We find that clouds tend to be aligned parallel to the field with a weak field, and become perpendicularly aligned with a stronger field, whereas on clump scales the alignment is more random. The magnetic fields and densities of clouds and clumps in our models agree with the Zeeman measurements of the Crutcher relation $B-\rho$ in the weaker field models, whilst the strongest field models show a relation which is too flat compared to the observations. In all our models, we find both subcritical and supercritical clouds and clumps are present. We also find that if using a line of sight (1D) measure of the magnetic field to determine the critical parameter, the magnetic field, and thereby also criticality, can vary by a factor of 3-4 depending on whether the direction the field is measured along corresponds to the direction of the ordered component of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Resolved Ionization Mapping of Broad Line Region. I. Insights into Diverse Geometry and Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originate from the broad-line region (BLR), consisting of dense gas clouds in orbit around an accreting supermassive black hole. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of the region is crucial for gaining insights into the physics and evolution of AGNs. Conventional velocity-resolved reverberation mapping may face challenges in disentangling the degeneracy between intricate motion and geometry of this region. To address this challenge, new key constraints are required. Here, we report the discovery of an asymmetric BLR using a novel technique: velocity-resolved ionization mapping, which can map the distance of emitting gas clouds by measuring Hydrogen line ratios at different velocities. By analyzing spectroscopic monitoring data, we find that the Balmer decrement is anticorrelated with the continuum and correlated with the lags across broad emission line velocities. Some line ratio profiles deviate from the expectations for a symmetrically virialized BLR, suggesting that the red-shifted and blue-shifted gas clouds may not be equidistant from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This asymmetric geometry might represent a formation imprint, provide new perspectives on the evolution of AGNs, and influence SMBH mass measurements.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Variability in Nearby Galaxies from the MaNGA Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use mid-infrared variability in galaxies to search for active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local universe. We use a sample of 10,220 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV). For each galaxy, we examine its mid-infrared variability in the $W2$ $[4.6\mu m]$ band over thirteen years using data from the Wide Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky and Near Earth Objects WISE (NEOWISE) missions. We demonstrate that we can detect variability signatures as small as about $7\%$ in the root-mean-square variation of $W2$ flux for the majority of cases. Using other AGN signatures of the variable galaxies, such as optical narrow lines, optical broad lines, and WISE $W1-W2$ colors, we show that $\sim 75\%$ of the variables show these additional AGN signatures, indicating that the bulk of these cases are likely to be AGN. We also identify seven galaxies that have light-curves characteristic of tidal disruption events. We present here a publicly available catalog of the light-curve variability in $W2$ of these galaxies.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of ultraluminous infrared galaxies in the IRAS and SDSS Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), leveraging data from the IRAS Faint Source Catalogue (FSC) and the spectroscopic catalog in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR16. Our meticulous cross-matching technique significantly enhances the reliability of ULIRG identification, resulting in the identification of 283 reliable ULIRGs, including 102 new detections, while discarding 120 previously reported false sources. Covering a redshift range of $z = 0.018 - 0.996$, with a median redshift of $\bar{z} = 0.259$, our uniform sample reveals apparent interaction features in approximately 40\% of ULIRGs, increasing to 92\% for those with $z &lt; 0.1$. Through optical spectra analysis, it is indicated that over 58\% of ULIRGs host an AGN, which is twice as high as the detections based solely on infrared colors. Moreover, a pronounced excess of radio emissions associated with AGN activity results in a steeper radio-far-infrared correlation. Notably, Type I ULIRGs exhibit properties similar to those of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), with an elevated incidence rate of \ion{Mg}{2} BALs (16.7\%), surpassing that of typical optically selected quasars by over tenfold, consistent with current evolutionary models. We anticipate that forthcoming telescopes such as the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Leighton Chajnantor Telescope (LCT) will provide deeper insights into ULIRG morphology, dust distribution, molecular gas, and AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Spin Parity of Spiral Galaxies IV -- Differential Reddening of Globular Cluster Systems of Nearby Spiral Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The northwest side of the disk of M31 is known to be the near side because of the differential reddening of globular clusters found from their photographic photometry. This paper reports a simple geometric model to evaluate the visibility of the effect and its application to published CCD photometry on globular cluster systems of three spiral galaxies, M31, M33, and NGC253. The color difference of globular cluster systems due to differential reddening was confirmed for M31 and NGC253; however, the data for M33 were insufficient. The analysis reaffirms the currently adopted interpretation that the side on the minor axis of the galactic disk, where more conspicuous dust features and interstellar reddening are visible, is the nearer side to us and provides an additional basis for using spiral galaxies with identified spiral windings, S-wise or Z-wise, to study the large-scale spin distribution of galaxies in the universe.</description>

      <title>A global view on star formation: The GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey X. Galactic HII region catalog using radio recombination lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of Galactic HII regions are of crucial importance for studying star formation and the evolution of the interstellar medium. Gaining an insight into their physical characteristics contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of these phenomena. The GLOSTAR project aims to provide a GLObal view on STAR formation in the Milky Way by performing an unbiased and sensitive survey. This is achieved by using the extremely wideband (4{-}8 GHz) C-band receiver of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Using radio recombination lines observed in the GLOSTAR survey with the VLA in D-configuration with a typical line sensitivity of 1{\sigma} {\sim} 3.0 mJy beam{^-1} at {\sim} 5 km s{^-1} and an angular resolution of 25", we cataloged 244 individual Galactic HII regions and derived their physical properties. We examined the mid-infrared (MIR) morphology of these HII regions and find that a significant portion of them exhibit a bubble-like morphology in the GLIMPSE 8 {\mu}m emission. We also searched for associations with the dust continuum and sources of methanol maser emission, other tracers of young stellar objects, and find that 48\% and 14\% of our HII regions, respectively, are coextensive with those. We measured the electron temperature for a large sample of HII regions within Galactocentric distances spanning from 1.6 to 13.1 kpc and derived the Galactic electron temperature gradient as {\sim} 372 {\pm} 28 K kpc{^-1} with an intercept of 4248 {\pm} 161 K, which is consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Abundances of planetary nebulae and evolved stars: Iron and sulfur depletion, and carbon and nitrogen enrichment, in low- and intermediate-mass stellar populations in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the elemental abundances in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) compared with those of their stellar progenitors (Red Giant Branch and Asymptotic Giant Branch, RGB and AGB, stars), to explore and quantify the expected -- i.e., due to AGB evolution or condensation onto grains -- differences. We gleaned the current literature for the nebular abundances while we used the APOGEE DR~17 survey data for the stellar sample. We examined the elements in common between the nebular and stellar samples, namely, C, N, O, Fe, and S. We confirm that iron in PNe is mostly entrapped in grains, with an average depletion $&lt;$D[Fe/H]$&gt;$=1.741$\pm$0.486 dex, and we disclose a weak correlation between iron depletion and the [O/H] abundance, D[Fe/H]$=(6.6003\pm2.443)\times{\rm [O/H]} +(1.972\pm0.199)$. Sulfur may also be mildly depleted in PNe, with $&lt;$D[S/H]$&gt;=0.179\pm0.291$ dex. We also found an indication of nitrogen enrichment for PNe $&lt;$E[N/H]$&gt;$=0.393$\pm$0.421 dex, with maximum enrichment (0.980$\pm$0.243) occurring for the PNe whose progenitors have gone through the HBB. The carbon enrichment is $&lt;$E[C/H]$&gt;$=0.332$\pm$0.460 dex when measured for the general PN populations. Our results will be relevant for future Galactic and extragalactic studies comparing nebular and stellar samples.</description>

      <title>The accreted stellar haloes of Milky Way-mass galaxies as a probe of the nature of the dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic stellar haloes are largely composed of the remnants of galaxies accreted during the assembly of their host galaxies, and hence their properties reflect the mass spectrum and post-accretion evolution of their satellites. As the nature of dark matter (DM) can affect both, we explore how the properties of the accreted stellar component vary across cold (CDM), warm (WDM) and self-interacting (SIDM) models. We do this by studying accreted stellar populations around eight MW-mass haloes using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations based on the EAGLE galaxy formation model, in which we find that the accreted stellar mass remains similar across models. Contrary to WDM, which only presents minor differences relative to CDM, the distribution of accreted stars in SIDM changes significantly within $0.05R_{200}$ ($10\,\mathrm{kpc}$). The central density reduces to $\langle \rho^{\mathrm{SIDM}}_{\mathrm{exsitu}} / \rho^{\mathrm{CDM}}_{\mathrm{exsitu}} \rangle = 0.3$ and has a shallower radial dependence, with logarithmic density slopes of $\langle \alpha_{\mathrm{SIDM}} \rangle = -1.4$ vs $\langle \alpha_{\mathrm{CDM}} \rangle = -1.7$. Additionally, stars are on more tangential orbits than their CDM counterparts, with a change in the velocity anisotropy of $\langle \Delta \beta \rangle = - 0.2$. Finally, SIDM stellar haloes have the largest number and prominence of overdensities in radius vs radial velocity space. This is due to a combination of shorter stellar halo progenitor merging timescales and shallower host potentials, with the former resulting in less time for dynamical friction and radialisation to operate. In summary, we show that the phase-space structure of Galactic stellar haloes encode key information that can be used to distinguish and rule out different DM models.</description>

      <title>The leakage of Lyman-continuum photons from a major merger at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of Lyman-continuum (LyC) photons from a massive interacting system at $z=1.097$ in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The LyC detection is made in the far-ultraviolet F154W band of the UVIT telescope onboard AstroSat. Both JWST and HST imaging of the system reveal signs that it is a likely merger. In particular, high-resolution imaging in the JWST bands reveals an infrared luminous object within the system that is faint in the bluer HST bands. The ionized-gas kinematics from the MUSE-UDF data supports the merger hypothesis. We estimate that the entire system is leaking more than $8 \%$ of its ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium. The SED-derived stellar masses of the two components indicate that this is a major merger with a mass ratio of ${1.13 \pm 0.37}$. This detection hints at the potential contribution of massive interacting systems at higher redshifts, when major mergers were more frequent, to the ionizing budget of the universe.</description>

      <title>Revealing the inner workings of the lensed quasar SDSS J1339+1310: Insights from microlensing analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to unveil the structure of the continuum and broad-emission line (BEL) emitting regions in the gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1339+1310 by examining the distinct signatures of microlensing present in this system. Our study involves a comprehensive analysis of ten years (2009-2019) of photometric monitoring data and seven spectroscopic observations acquired between 2007 and 2017. This work focuses on the pronounced deformations in the BEL profiles between images A and B, alongside the chromatic changes in their adjacent continua and the striking microlensing variability observed in the $r$-band light curves. We employed a statistical model to quantify the distribution and impact of microlensing magnifications and utilized a Bayesian approach to estimate the dimensions of various emission regions within the quasar. The analysis of the $r$-band light curves reveals substantial microlensing variability in the rest-frame UV continuum, suggesting that image B is amplified relative to image A by a factor of up to six. This finding is corroborated by pronounced microlensing-induced distortions in all studied BEL profiles (Ly$\alpha$, Si IV, C IV, C III], and Mg II), especially a prominent magnification of image B's red wing. We estimated the average dimensions of the BLR to be notably smaller than usual: the region emitting the blue wings measures $R_{1/2} = 11.5 \pm 1.7$ light-days, while the red wings originate from a more compact area of $R_{1/2} = 2.9\pm0.6$ light-days. From the photometric monitoring data, we inferred that the region emitting the $r$-band is $R_{1/2} = 2.2\pm0.3$ light-days across. Furthermore, by assessing the gravitational redshift of the UV Fe III blend and combining it with the blend's microlensing-based size estimate, we calculated the central SMBH's mass to be $M_{BH} \sim2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Element abundances of galactic RGB stars in the APO-K2 catalogue. Dissimilarity in the scaling with [$\alpha$/Fe]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted an investigation on the chemical abundances of 4,316 stars in the red giant branch (RGB) phase from the recently released APO-K2 catalogue. Our aim was to characterize the abundance trends of the single elements with [$\alpha$/Fe], mainly focusing on C, N, and O, which are the most relevant for the estimation of stellar ages. The chemical analysis of the RGB sample involved cross-matching data from the APO-K2 catalogue with individual element abundances from APOGEE DR17. The analysis detected a statistically significant difference in the [(C+N+O)/Fe] - [$\alpha$/Fe] trend with respect to the simple $\alpha$-enhancement scenario. This difference remained robust across different choices for the reference solar mixture and potential zero-point calibrations of C and N abundances. The primary discrepancy was a steeper increase in [O/Fe] with [$\alpha$/Fe], reaching a 0.1 dex difference at [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3. Notably, the impact on the evolutionary timescale of such oxygen over-abundance with respect to the commonly adopted uniform $\alpha$-enhancement is rather limited. We verified that stellar models computed using an ad hoc O-rich mixture sped up the evolution by only 1% at [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3, due to the counterbalancing effects of O enrichment on both the evolutionary timescale and the Z-to-[Fe/H] relationship.</description>

      <title>The first catalogue of candidate white dwarf-main sequence binaries in open star clusters: A new window into common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close binary systems are the progenitors to both Type Ia supernovae and the compact object mergers that can be detected via gravitational waves. To achieve a binary with a small radial separation, it is believed that the system likely undergoes common envelope (CE) evolution. Despite its importance, CE evolution may be one of the largest uncertainties in binary evolution due to a combination of computational challenges and a lack of observed benchmarks where both the post-CE and pre-CE conditions are known. Identifying post-CE systems in star clusters can partially circumvent this second issue by providing an independent age constraint on the system. For the first time, we conduct a systematic search for white dwarf (WD) and main-sequence (MS) binary systems in 299 Milky Way open star clusters. Coupling Gaia DR3 photometry and kinematics with multi-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS, we apply a machine learning based approach and find 52 high-probability candidates in 38 open clusters. For a subset of our systems, we present follow-up spectroscopy from the Gemini and Lick Observatories and archival light curves from TESS, Kepler/K2 and the Zwicky Transient Facility. Examples of M-dwarfs with hot companions are spectroscopically observed, along with regular system variability. While the kinematics of our candidates are consistent with their host clusters, some systems have spatial positions offset relative to their hosts, potentially indicative of natal kicks. Ultimately, this catalogue is a first step to obtaining a set of observational benchmarks to better link post-CE systems to their pre-CE progenitors.</description>

      <title>FAUST XVII: Super deuteration in the planet forming system IRS 63 where the streamer strikes the disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that planets formation starts early, in protostellar disks of $\le10^5$ yrs, which are characterized by strong interactions with the environment, e.g., through accretion streamers and molecular outflows. To investigate the impact of such phenomena on disk physical and chemical properties it is key to understand what chemistry planets inherit from their natal environment. In the context of the ALMA Large Program Fifty AU STudy of the chemistry in the disk/envelope system of Solar-like protostars (FAUST), we present observations on scales from ~1500 au to ~60 au of H$_2$CO, HDCO, and D$_2$CO towards the young planet-forming disk IRS~63. H$_2$CO probes the gas in the disk as well as in a large scale streamer (~1500 au) impacting onto the South-East (SE) disk side. We detect for the first time deuterated formaldehyde, HDCO and D$_2$CO, in a planet-forming disk, and HDCO in the streamer that is feeding it. This allows us to estimate the deuterium fractionation of H$_2$CO in the disk: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO]$\sim0.1-0.3$ and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO]$\sim0.1$. Interestingly, while HDCO follows the H$_2$CO distribution in the disk and in the streamer, the distribution of D$_2$CO is highly asymmetric, with a peak of the emission (and [D]/[H] ratio) in the SE disk side, where the streamer crashes onto the disk. In addition, D$_2$CO is detected in two spots along the blue- and red-shifted outflow. This suggests that: (i) in the disk, HDCO formation is dominated by gas-phase reactions similarly to H$_2$CO, while (ii) D$_2$CO was mainly formed on the grain mantles during the prestellar phase and/or in the disk itself, and is at present released in the gas-phase in the shocks driven by the streamer and the outflow. These findings testify on the key role of streamers in the build-up of the disk both concerning the final mass available for planet formation and its chemical composition.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: first data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first public data release of the S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS), a photometric survey with short exposure times, covering approximately 9300 deg$^{2}$ of the Southern sky. The USS utilizes the Javalambre 12-band magnitude system, including narrow and medium-band and broad-band filters targeting prominent stellar spectral features. The primary objective of the USS is to identify bright, extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -3$) and ultra metal-poor (UMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -4$) stars for further analysis using medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy.}{This paper provides an overview of the survey observations, calibration method, data quality, and data products. Additionally, it presents the selection of EMP and UMP candidates.}{The data from the USS were reduced and calibrated using the same methods as presented in the S-PLUS DR2. An additional step was introduced, accounting for the offset between the observed magnitudes off the USS and the predicted magnitudes from the very low-resolution Gaia XP spectra.}{This first release contains data for 163 observed fields totaling $\sim$324 deg$^{2}$ along the Celestial Equator. The magnitudes obtained from the USS are well-calibrated, showing a difference of $\sim 15$ mmag compared to the predicted magnitudes by the GaiaXPy toolkit. By combining colors and magnitudes, 140 candidates for EMP or UMP have been identified for follow-up studies.}{The S-PLUS USS DR1 is an important milestone in the search for bright metal-poor stars, with magnitudes in the range 10 $ &lt; r \leq 14$. The USS is an ongoing survey; in the near future, it will provide many more bright metal-poor candidate stars for spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>An activity transition in FRB 20201124A: methodological rigor, detection of frequency-dependent cessation, and a geometric magnetar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report detections of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the repeating source FRB 20201124A with Apertif/WSRT and GMRT, and measurements of basic burst properties, especially the dispersion measure (DM) and fluence. Based on comparisons of these properties with previously published larger samples, we argue that the excess DM reported earlier for pulses with integrated signal to noise ratio $\lesssim 1000$ is due to incompletely accounting for the so-called sad trombone effect, even when using structure-maximizing DM algorithms. Our investigations of fluence distributions next lead us to advise against formal power-law fitting, especially dissuading the use of the least-square method, and we demonstrate the large biases involved. A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) provides a much more accurate estimate of the power law and we provide accessible code for direct inclusion in future research. Our GMRT observations were fortuitously scheduled around the end of the activity cycle as recorded by FAST. We detected several bursts (one of them very strong) at 400/600 MHz, a few hours after sensitive FAST non-detections already showed the 1.3 GHz FRB emission to have ceased. After FRB 20180916B, this is a second example of a frequency-dependent activity window identified in a repeating FRB source. Since numerous efforts have so-far failed to determine a spin period for FRB 20201124A, we conjecture it to be an ultra-long period magnetar, with a period on the scale of months, and with a very wide, highly irregular duty cycle. Assuming the emission comes from closed field lines, we use radius-to-frequency mapping and polarization information from other studies to constrain the magnetospheric geometry and location of the emission region. Our initial findings are consistent with a possible connection between FRBs and crustal motion events.</description>

      <title>Low velocity streams inside the planetary nebula H 2-18. A 3D photoionization and kinematical reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Numerous planetary nebulae show complicated inner structures not obviously explained. For one such object we undertake a detailed 3D photoionization and kinematical model analysis for a better understanding of the underlying shaping processes. Methods. We obtained 2D ARGUS/IFU spectroscopy covering the whole nebula in selected, representative emission lines. A 3D photoionization modelling was used to compute images and line profiles. Comparison of the observations with the models was used to fine-tune the model details. This predicts the approximate nebular 3D structure and kinematics. Results. We found that within a cylindrical outer nebula there is a hidden, very dense, bar-like or cylindrical inner structure. Both features are co-axial and are inclined to the sky by 40 deg. A wide asymmetric one-sided plume attached to one end of the bar is proposed to be a flat structure. All nebular components share the same kinematics, with an isotropic velocity field which monotonically increases with distance from the star before reaching a plateau. The relatively low velocities indicate that the observed shapes do not require particularly energetic processes and there is no indication for the current presence of a jet. The 3D model reproduces the observed line ratios and the detailed structure of the object significantly better than previous models.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the evolving bipolar outflows in symbiotic novae: the case of RSOphiuchi 2021 nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recurrent and symbiotic nova RS Ophiuchi (RSOph) underwent a new outburst phase during August 2021, about 15 years after the last event occurred in 2006. This represents the first nova event ever detected at very-high energies (VHE, E&gt;100\,GeV), and a whole set of coordinated multi-wavelength observations were triggered. The main goals of this work are to characterize the evolving morphology of the expanding bipolar ejecta with high accuracy and determine the physical conditions of the surrounding medium in which they propagate. By means of high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations, we monitored RSOph with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and e-MERLIN at 1.6 and 5\,GHz during multiple epochs from 14 to 65 days after the explosion. We reveal an evolving source structure, consisting of a central and compact core and two elongated bipolar outflows, expanding on opposite sides from the core in east-west direction. The ejecta angular separation with time is consistent with a linear expansion with an average speed of $\sim7000$ km s$^{-1}$. We find clear evidence of a radial dependence of the density along the density enhancement on the orbital plane (DEOP), going from 1.1$\times$10$^7$ ~cm$^{-3}$ close to the central binary to 3.8$\times$10$^5$~cm$^{-3}$ at $\sim175$~AU. Thanks to the accurate source astrometric position provided by Gaia DR3, in this work we draw a detailed scenario of the geometry and physics of the RSOph evolving source structure after the most recent nova event. We conclude that most of the mass lost by the red giant companion goes in the DEOP, for which we estimate a total mass of $4.3 \times 10^{-6} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and in the circumstellar region, while only a small fraction (about one-tenth) is accreted by the white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Metallicity of RR Lyrae stars from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalogue computed with Machine Learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new $P -\phi_{31}-{\rm [Fe/H]}$ and $P -\phi_{31}- A_2 - {\rm [Fe/H]}$ relations for fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone mode (RRc) RR Lyrae stars (RRLs), respectively. The relations were calibrated based on pulsation periods and Fourier parameters of the RRL light curves in the Gaia $G$-band published in the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), and accurate spectroscopically measured metallicities available in the literature. We apply the feature selection algorithm to identify the most relevant parameters for the determination of metallicity. To fit the relations, we used the Bayesian approach, which allowed us to carefully take into account uncertainties in various parameters and the intrinsic scatter of the relations. The root mean squared errors of the predicted metallicity values in the training samples are 0.28 dex and 0.21 dex for RRab and RRc stars, respectively, comparable with the typical uncertainty of low/intermediate resolution spectroscopic metallicity measurements. We applied the new relations to measure individual metallicities and distances to $\sim$ 134,000 RRLs from the Gaia DR3 catalogue, as well as mean metallicities and distances to 38 Milky Way globular clusters. We also estimate the mean metallicity and distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC): ${\rm [Fe/H]_{LMC} = -1.63\pm0.36}$ and $\mu_{\rm LMC}=18.55\pm0.18$~mag, ${\rm [Fe/H]_{SMC}=-1.86\pm0.36}$~dex and $\mu_{\rm SMC}=19.01\pm 0.17$~mag, respectively, in excellent agreement with previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Galactic population of free-floating planets from realistic initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first prediction for the mass distribution function of Galactic free-floating planets (FFPs) that aims to accurately include the relative contributions of multiple formation pathways and stellar populations. We derive our predicted distribution from dedicated simulations of planet birth, growth, migration, and ejection around circumbinary systems and extend these results to also include the contributions from single and wide binary systems. Our resulting FFP mass distribution shows several distinct features, including a strong peak at $\sim 8 M_{\oplus}$ arising from the transition between pebble and gas accretion regimes and a trough at $\sim 1 M_{\oplus}$ due to the shift in the dominant ejection process from planet-planet scattering to ejection through interactions with stars in circumbinary systems. We find that interactions with the central binary in close circumbinary systems are likely the dominant progenitor for FFPs more massive than Earth, leading to a steep power-law dependence in mass that agrees well with existing observations. In contrast, we find planet-planet scattering events in single and wide binary systems likely produce the majority of planets at Mars mass and below, resulting in a shallower power-law dependence. Our results suggest that existing extrapolations into the sub-terrestrial mass range may significantly overestimate the true FFP abundance. The features we predict in the mass distribution of FFPs will be detectable by upcoming space-based microlensing surveys and, if observed, will provide key insight into the origins of FFPs and the environments in which they form.</description>

      <title>The imprint of magnetic fields on absorption spectra from circumgalactic wind-cloud systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic winds probe how stellar feedback regulates the mass and metallicity of galaxies. Observations show that galactic winds are multiphase and magnetised. In the local Universe, the dense phase is traced by emission and absorption lines, which reveal the presence of fast-moving clouds embedded in hot streams. Simulations tell us that magnetic fields can shield such clouds and delay their disruption, but there is little discussed on their observational effects. Using 3D MHD simulations, we study the influence of two orientations of the magnetic field (aligned and transverse) on the cloud morphology, temperature and density structure, mixing fraction, ion kinematics, column densities, and absorption spectra. We study supersonic wind-cloud systems with radiative processes, and develop a framework to extract ion column density maps and synthetic absorption spectra. The framework relies on studying ion populations and creating down-the-barrel spectra via an interface that links our PLUTO simulations to TRIDENT using YT, CLOUDY, and STARBURST99. We find that the transverse magnetic field makes the cloud asymmetric, shields and protects dense cold gas, and reduces mixing fractions compared to the aligned case. Ions can reach higher velocities in the transverse field case. The imprints of the initial orientation of the field on the synthetic spectra are: in the cold phase we find no signature of C ii and Si ii when the field is aligned, in the intermediate phase traced by C iv and Si iv we find broader lines in the transverse case, and in the warm phase we find deeper lines for O vi and N v in the aligned case, but they are less sensitive to the field orientation. Magnetic fields significantly affect the absorption spectra of cold clouds. Intermediate ions are the most sensitive to the magnetic field orientation and can potentially yield information about magnetic field topology.</description>

      <title>Entrainment of Hot Gas into Cold Streams: The Origin of Excessive Star-formation Rates at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of cold streams from the cosmic web that feed galaxies through their shock-heated circumgalactic medium (CGM) at cosmic noon, $z\simeq 1-5$. In addition to the hydrodynamical instabilities and radiative cooling that we have incorporated in earlier works, we embed the stream and the hot CGM in the gravitational potential of the host dark-matter halo, deriving equilibrium profiles for both. Self-gravity within the stream is tentatively ignored. We find that the cold streams gradually entrain a large mass of initially hot CGM gas that cools in the mixing layer and condenses onto the stream. This entrainment, combined with the acceleration down the gravitational potential well, typically triples the inward cold inflow rate into the central galaxy, compared to the original rate at the virial radius, which makes the entrained gas the dominant source of gas supply to the galaxy. The potential sources for the hot gas to be entrained are recycled enriched gas that has been previously ejected from the galaxy, and fresh virial-shock-heated gas that has accumulated in the CGM. This can naturally elevate the star formation rate in the galaxy by a factor of $\sim 3$ compared to the gas accretion rate onto the halo, thus explaining the otherwise puzzling observed excess of star formation at cosmic noon. When accounting for self-shielding of dense gas from the UV background, we find that the energy radiated from the streams, originating predominantly from the cooling of the entrained gas, is consistent with observed Lyman-$\alpha$ blobs around galaxies.</description>

      <title>Offset of M54 from the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous modeling of 2D (projected along the line of sight) position, proper motion and line-of-sight velocity for \textit{Gaia}- and APOGEE-observed stars near the centre of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We use a mixture model that allows for independent sub-populations contributed by the Sgr galaxy, its nuclear star cluster M54, and the Milky Way foreground. We find an offset of $0.295\pm 0.029$ degrees between the inferred centroids of Sgr and M54, corresponding to a (projected) physical separation of $0.135\pm 0.013$ kpc. The detected offset might plausibly be driven by unmodelled asymmetry in Sgr's stellar configuration; however, standard criteria for model selection favour our symmetric model over an alternative that allows for bilateral asymmetry. We infer an offset between the proper motion centres of Sgr and M54 of $[\Delta\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta,\Delta\mu_{\delta}]=[4.9, -19.7] \pm [6.8, 6.2]$ $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ ($[0.61, -2.46] \pm [0.85, 0.77] $ km s$^{-1}$), with magnitude similar to the covariance expected due to spatially-correlated systematic error. We infer an offset of $4.1\pm 1.2$ km s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity. Using inferred values for the systemic positions and motions of Sgr and M54 as initial conditions, we calculate the recent orbital history of a simplified Sgr/M54 system, which we demonstrate to be sensitive to any line-of-sight distance offset between M54 and Sgr, and to the distribution of dark matter within Sgr.</description>

      <title>From Seeds to Supermassive Black Holes: Capture, Growth, Migration, and Pairing in Dense Proto-Bulge Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origins and mergers of supermassive black holes (BHs) remain a mystery. We describe a scenario from a novel multi-physics simulation featuring rapid ($\lesssim 1\,$Myr) hyper-Eddington gas capture by a $\sim 1000\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ ``seed'' BH up to supermassive ($\gtrsim 10^{6}\,M_{\odot}$) masses, in a massive, dense molecular cloud complex typical of high-redshift starbursts. Due to the high cloud density, stellar feedback is inefficient and most of the gas turns into stars in star clusters which rapidly merge hierarchically, creating deep potential wells. Relatively low-mass BH seeds at random positions can be ``captured'' by merging sub-clusters and migrate to the center in $\sim1$ free-fall time (vastly faster than dynamical friction). This also efficiently produces a paired BH binary with $\sim 0.1$\,pc separation. The centrally-concentrated stellar density profile (akin to a ``proto-bulge'') allows the cluster as a whole to capture and retain gas and build up a large (pc-scale) circum-binary accretion disk with gas coherently funnelled to the central BH (even when the BH radius of influence is small). The disk is ``hyper-magnetized'' and ``flux-frozen'': dominated by a toroidal magnetic field with plasma $\beta \sim 10^{-3}$, with the fields amplified by flux-freezing. This drives hyper-Eddington inflow rates $\gtrsim 1\,\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$, which also drive the two BHs to nearly-equal masses. The late-stage system appears remarkably similar to recently-observed high-redshift ``little red dots.'' This scenario can provide an explanation for rapid SMBH formation, growth and mergers in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Observation of Complex Organic Molecules Containing Peptide-like Bonds Toward Hot Core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In star formation regions, the complex organic molecules (COMs) that contain peptide bonds ($-$NH$-$C(=O)$-$) play a major role in the metabolic process because $-$NH$-$C(=O)$-$ is connected to amino acids (R-CHNH$_{2}$$-$COOH). Over the past few decades, many COMs containing peptide-like bonds have been detected in hot molecular cores (HMCs), hot corinos, and cold molecular clouds, however, their prebiotic chemistry is poorly understood. We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO) and isocyanic acid (HNCO), which contain peptide-like bonds toward the chemically rich HMC G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, using high-resolution and high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array bands 6 and 7. We estimate that the column densities of NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO toward G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 are (2.80$\pm$0.29)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (1.80$\pm$0.42)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with excitation temperatures of 165 $\pm$ 21 K and 170 $\pm$ 32 K, respectively. The fractional abundances of NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO toward G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 are (9.03$\pm$1.44)$\times$10$^{-10}$ and (5.80$\pm$2.09)$\times$10$^{-9}$. We compare the estimated abundances of NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO with the existing three-phase warm-up chemical model abundance values and notice that the observed and modelled abundances are very close. We conclude that NH$_{2}$CHO is produced by the reaction of NH$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$CO in the gas phase toward G358.93$-$0.03 MM1. Likewise, HNCO is produced on the surface of grains by the reaction of NH and CO toward G358.93$-$0.03 MM1. We also find that NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO are chemically linked toward G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.</description>

      <title>ColdSIM predictions of [C II] emission in primordial galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful tool to probe the gas content at high redshift is the [C II] 158 $\mu$m sub-millimeter emission line, which, due to its low excitation potential and luminous emission, is considered a possible direct tracer of star forming gas. In this work we investigate the origin, evolution and environmental dependencies of [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission line, as well as its expected correlation with stellar mass and star formation activity of the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST. We use a set of state-of-the-art cold-gas hydrodynamic simulations (ColdSIM) with fully coupled time-dependent atomic and molecular non-equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent [C II] emission from metal enriched gas. We accurately track the evolution of H I, H II and $H_2$ in a cosmological context and predict both global and galaxy-based [C II] properties. For the first time, we predict the cosmic mass density evolution of [C II] and find that it is in good agreement with new measurements at redshift z = 6 from high-resolution optical quasar spectroscopy. We find a correlation between [C II] luminosity, $L_{[C II]}$, and stellar mass, consistent with results from ALMA high-redshift large programs. We predict a redshift evolution in the relation between $L_{[C II]}$ and the star formation rate, SFR, and provide a fit to relate $L_{[C II]}$ to SFR which can be adopted as a more accurate alternative to the currently used linear relation. Our findings provide physical grounds to interpret high-redshift detections in contemporary and future observations, such as the ones performed by ALMA and JWST, and to advance our knowledge on structure formation at early times.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that filamentary structures are representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds and support a filament paradigm for star formation, potentially accounting for the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Using Herschel imaging observations of the California giant molecular cloud, we aim to further investigate the filament paradigm for low- to intermediate-mass star formation and to better understand the exact role of filaments in the origin of stellar masses. Using the multiscale, multiwavelength extraction method getsf, we identify starless cores, protostars, and filaments in the Herschel data set and separate these components from the background cloud contribution to determine accurate core and filament properties. Both the prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the distribution of filament masses per unit length or filament line mass function (FLMF) are consistent with power-law distributions at the high-mass end, $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log}M\propto M^{-1.4 \pm 0.2}$ at $M &gt; 1\,M_\odot$ for the CMF and $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log} {M}_{\rm line} \propto {M}_{\rm line}^{-1.5\pm0.2}$ for the FLMF at $M_{\rm line} &gt; 10\,M_\odot {\rm pc^{-1}}$, which are both consistent with the Salpeter power-law IMF. Based on these results, we propose a revised model for the origin of the CMF in filaments, whereby the global prestellar CMF in a molecular cloud arises from the integration of the CMFs generated by individual thermally supercritical filaments within the cloud. Our findings support the existence a tight connection between the FLMF and the CMF/IMF and suggests that filamentary structures represent a critical evolutionary step in establishing a Salpeter-like mass function.</description>

      <title>Constraining the physical properties of gas in high-z galaxies with far-infrared and submillimetre line ratios</title>

Abstract: Optical emission line diagnostics, which are a common tool to constrain the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, become progressively inaccessible at higher redshifts for ground-based facilities. Far-infrared (FIR) emission lines, which are redshifted into atmospheric windows accessible by ground-based sub-millimeter facilities, could provide alternative ISM diagnostics to optical emission lines. We investigate FIR line ratios involving [CII]$\lambda 158 \mu$m, [OIII]$\lambda 88 \mu$m, [OIII]$\lambda 52 \mu$m, [NII]$\lambda 122 \mu$m and [NIII$\lambda 57 \mu$m, using synthetic emission lines applied to a high-resolution (m$_{\rm gas}$= 883.4 M$_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation, including radiative-transfer post processing with KramsesRT at z = 6.5. We find that the [CII]/[NII]122 ratio is sensitive to the temperature and density of photo-dissociation regions, and thus could be a useful tool to trace the properties of this gas phase in galaxies. We also find that [NII]/[NIII] is a good tracer of the temperature and [OIII]52/[OIII]88 a good tracer of the gas density of HII regions. Emission line ratios containing the [OIII]$\lambda 88 \mu$m line are sensitive to high velocity outflowing gas.</description>

      <title>Early Galaxies and Early Dark Energy: A Unified Solution to the Hubble Tension and Puzzles of Massive Bright Galaxies revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a large population of ultra-violet (UV)-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ and possibly overly massive galaxies at $z\gtrsim 7$, challenging standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use an empirical galaxy formation model to explore the potential of alleviating these tensions through an Early Dark Energy (EDE) model, originally proposed to solve the Hubble tension. Our benchmark model demonstrates excellent agreement with the UV luminosity functions (UVLFs) at $4\lesssim z \lesssim10$ in both $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies. In the EDE cosmology, the UVLF measurements at $z\simeq 12$ based on spectroscopically confirmed galaxies exhibit no tension with the benchmark model. Photometric constraints at $12 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$ can be fully explained within EDE via either moderately increased star formation efficiencies ($\epsilon_{\ast}\sim 3-10\%$ at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) or enhanced UV variabilities ($\sigma_{\rm UV}\sim 0.8-1.3$ mag at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) that are within the scatter of hydrodynamical simulation predictions. A similar agreement is difficult to achieve in $\Lambda$CDM, especially at $z\gtrsim 14$, where the required $\sigma_{\rm UV}$ exceeds the maximum value seen in simulations. Furthermore, the implausibly large cosmic stellar mass densities inferred from some JWST observations are no longer in tension with cosmology when the EDE is considered. Our findings highlight EDE as an intriguing unified solution to a fundamental problem in cosmology and the recent tensions raised by JWST observations. Data at the highest redshifts reached by JWST ($z \sim 14-16$) will be crucial for differentiating modified galaxy formation physics from new cosmological physics.</description>

      <title>AGN STORM 2: VIII. Investigating the Narrow Absorption Lines in Mrk 817 Using HST-COS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk817 during an intensive multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign for 16 months. Here, we examine the behavior of narrow UV absorption lines seen in HST/COS spectra, both during the campaign and in other epochs extending over 14 years. We conclude that while the narrow absorption outflow system (at -3750 km/s with FWHM=177 km/s) responds to the variations of the UV continuum as modified by the X-ray obscurer, its total column density (logNH =19.5 cm-2) did not change across all epochs. The adjusted ionization parameter (scaled with respect to the variations in the Hydrogen ionizing continuum flux) is log UH =-1.0. The outflow is located at a distance smaller than 38 parsecs from the central source, which implies a hydrogen density of nH &gt; 3000 cm-3. The absorption outflow system only covers the continuum emission source and not the broad emission line region, which suggests that its transverse size is small (&lt; 1e16 cm), with potential cloud geometries ranging from spherical to elongated along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Stellar metallicity is a key parameter for the search of Life in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>Estimation of line-of-sight velocities of individual galaxies using neural networks I. Modelling redshift-space distortions at large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the line-of-sight velocities of individual galaxies from an observed redshift-space galaxy distribution. We find an estimate of the peculiar velocity at a galaxy based on galaxy counts and barycenters in shells around it. By training the network with environmental characteristics, such as the total mass and mass center within each shell surrounding every galaxy in redshift space, our ANN model can accurately predict the line-of-sight velocity of each individual galaxy. When this velocity is used to eliminate the RSD effect, the two-point correlation function (TPCF) in real space can be recovered with an accuracy better than 1% at $s$ &gt; 8 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, and 4% on all scales compared to ground truth. The real-space power spectrum can be recovered within 3% on $k$&lt; 0.5 $\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}h$, and less than 5% for all $k$ modes. The quadrupole moment of the TPCF or power spectrum is almost zero down to $s$ = 10 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ or all $k$ modes, indicating an effective correction of the spatial anisotropy caused by the RSD effect. We demonstrate that on large scales, without additional training with new data, our network is adaptable to different galaxy formation models, different cosmological models, and mock galaxy samples at high redshifts and high biases, achieving less than 10% error for scales greater than 15 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. As it is sensitive to large-scale densities, it does not manage to remove Fingers of God in large clusters, but works remarkably well at recovering real-space galaxy positions elsewhere. Our scheme provides a novel way to predict the peculiar velocity of individual galaxies, to eliminate the RSD effect directly in future large galaxy surveys, and to reconstruct the 3-D cosmic velocity field accurately.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrino-DM interactions with Milky Way dwarf spheroidals and supernova neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the neutrino-dark matter cross section using properties of the dark matter density profiles of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The constraint arises from core-collapse supernova neutrinos scattering on dark matter as a form of energy injection, allowing the transformation of the dark matter density profile from a cusped profile to a flatter profile. We assume a standard cosmology of dark energy and cold, collisionless, and non-self-interacting dark matter. By requiring that the dark matter cores do not lose too much mass or overshoot constraints from stellar kinematics, we place an upper limit on the cross section of $\sigma_{\nu-\mathrm{DM}}(E_\nu=15 \, \mathrm{MeV}, m_\chi\lesssim130 \, \mathrm{GeV}) \approx 3.4 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{cm^2}$ and $\sigma_{\nu-\mathrm{DM}}(E_\nu=15 \, \mathrm{MeV}, m_\chi\gtrsim130 \, \mathrm{GeV}) \approx 3.2 \times 10^{-27} \left( \frac{m_\chi}{1\,\mathrm{GeV}}\right)^2\, \mathrm{cm^2}$, which is stronger than previous bounds for these energies. Consideration of baryonic feedback or host galaxy effects on the dark matter profile can strengthen this constraint.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inflation and Dark Sector from 11D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori with a general genus and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the FRW universe with four extended spacetime dimensions and seven extremely small compactified spatial dimensions emerges as a solution for the 11D supergravity. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution imaging survey of massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the binary fraction of young massive stellar objects (mYSOs) are important for binary and massive star formation theory. Here, we present speckle imaging of 34 mYSOs located in the Large (1/2 $Z_{\odot}$) and Small Magellanic Clouds ($\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$), probing projected separations between the 2000-20000 au (at angular scales of 0.02-0.2") range, for stars above 8 $M_{\odot}$. We find two wide binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (from a sample of 23 targets), but none in a sample of 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, leading us to adopt a wide binary fraction of 9$\pm$5%, and $&lt;$5%, respectively. We rule out a wide binary fraction greater than 35% in the Large, and 38% in the Small Magellanic Cloud at the 99% confidence level. This is in contrast to the wide binary fraction of mYSOs in the Milky Way (presumed $Z_{\odot}$), which within the physical parameter space probed by this study is $\sim$15-60% from the literature. We argue that while selection effects could be responsible for the lower binary fraction observed; it is more likely that there are underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed properties. This indicates that metallicity and environmental effects may influence the formation of wide binaries among massive stars. Future larger, statistically more significant samples of high-mass systems in low-metallicity environments, and for comparison in the Milky Way, are essential to confirm or repudiate our claim.</description>
