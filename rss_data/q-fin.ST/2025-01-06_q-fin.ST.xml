      <title>The VIX as Stochastic Volatility for Corporate Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22498v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classic stochastic volatility models assume volatility is unobservable. We use the Volatility Index: S&amp;P 500 VIX to observe it, to easier fit the model. We apply it to corporate bonds. We fit autoregression for corporate rates and for risk spreads between these rates and Treasury rates. Next, we divide residuals by VIX. Our main idea is such division makes residuals closer to the ideal case of a Gaussian white noise. This is remarkable, since these residuals and VIX come from separate market segments. Similarly, we model corporate bond returns as a linear function of rates and rate changes. Our article has two main parts: Moody's AAA and BAA spreads; Bank of America investment-grade and high-yield rates, spreads, and returns. We analyze long-term stability of these models.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Trading Factor Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The residuals in factor models prevalent in asset pricing presents opportunities to exploit the mis-pricing from unexplained cross-sectional variation for arbitrage. We performed a replication of the methodology of Guijarro-Ordonez et al. (2019) (G-P-Z) on Deep Learning Statistical Arbitrage (DLSA), originally applied to U.S. equity data from 1998 to 2016, using a more recent out-of-sample period from 2016 to 2024. Adhering strictly to point-in-time (PIT) principles and ensuring no information leakage, we follow the same data pre-processing, factor modeling, and deep learning architectures (CNNs and Transformers) as outlined by G-P-Z. Our replication yields unusually strong performance metrics in certain tests, with out-of-sample Sharpe ratios occasionally exceeding 10. While such results are intriguing, they may indicate model overfitting, highly specific market conditions, or insufficient accounting for transaction costs and market impact. Further examination and robustness checks are needed to align these findings with the more modest improvements reported in the original study. (This work was conducted as the final project for IEOR 4576: Data-Driven Methods in Finance at Columbia University.)</description>

      <title>Empirical Asset Pricing via Ensemble Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an ensemble learning method based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting conditional expected stock returns given stock-level and macro-economic information. Our ensemble learning approach significantly reduces the computational complexity inherent in GPR inference and lends itself to general online learning tasks. We conduct an empirical analysis on a large cross-section of US stocks from 1962 to 2016. We find that our method dominates existing machine learning models statistically and economically in terms of out-of-sample $R$-squared and Sharpe ratio of prediction-sorted portfolios. Exploiting the Bayesian nature of GPR, we introduce the mean-variance optimal portfolio with respect to the prediction uncertainty distribution of the expected stock returns. It appeals to an uncertainty averse investor and significantly dominates the equal- and value-weighted prediction-sorted portfolios, which outperform the S&amp;P 500.</description>
