      <title>Optimal Hardy Inequality for Fractional Laplacians on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fractional Hardy inequality on the integer lattice. We prove null-criticality of the Hardy weight and hence optimality of the constant. More specifically, we present a family of Hardy weights with respect to a parameter and show that below a certain threshold the Hardy weight is positive critical while above the threshold it is subcritical. In particular, the Hardy weight at the threshold is optimal in the sense that any larger weight would fail to be a Hardy weight and the Hardy inequality does not allow for a minimizer. A crucial ingredient in our proof is an asymptotic expansion of the fractional discrete Riesz kernel.</description>

      <title>Necessary conditions for weighted estimates of Multilinear Multipliers and Pseudo-Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal multiple weight assumptions in the weighted theory of multilinear Fourier multipliers and multilinear pseudo-differential operators. For multilinear Fourier multipliers, we revisit the weighted H\"ormander-type theorem of Li and Sun, as a multilinear version of Kurtz and Wheeden, and show that their multiple weight condition is sharp. This provides the sharp necessary condition in the multilinear setting and simultaneously improves the classical linear necessity established by Kurtz and Wheeden. In the pseudo-differential setting, we consider recent weighted estimates of the authors for symbols in the multilinear H\"ormander class and prove that their multiple weight hypothesis is also best possible. As a corollary, we can obtain the optimality of sharp maximal function estimates for multilinear pseudo-differential operators in the papers of the authors which originated from the results of Chanillo and Torchinsky.</description>

      <title>On oscillator death in the Winfree model I: the one-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for the standard sinusoidal Winfree model, a coupling strength exceeding twice the maximal magnitude of the intrinsic frequencies guarantees the convergence of the system for Lebesgue almost every initial data. This is proven by first showing, via an order parameter bootstrapping argument, that the pathwise critical coupling strength is upper bounded by a function of the order parameter, and then showing by a volumetric argument that for Lebesgue almost every data the order parameter cannot stay below and be bounded away from 1 for all time; this is a Winfree model counterpart of the analysis of Ha and the author (2020) performed for the Kuramoto model. Using concentration of measure and the aforementioned volumetric argument, we show that, except possibly on a set of very small measure, oscillator death is observed in finite time; this rigorously demonstrates the existence of the oscillator death regime numerically observed by Ariaratnam and Strogatz (2001). These results are robust under many other choices of interaction functions often considered for the Winfree model. We demonstrate that the asymptotic dynamics described in this paper are sharp by analyzing the equilibria of the Winfree model, and we bound the total number of equilibria using a polynomial description. The sequel to this paper will deal with the Winfree model on higher-dimensional manifolds, such as the Euclidean spheres and the unitary groups.</description>

      <title>The Anisotropic Balian-Low Phenomenon and the Variational Construction of Wavelet Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability of wavelet frames within anisotropic function spaces. By replacing classical integral estimates with a matrix algebra approach, we establish the boundedness of frame operators and derive optimal dual wavelets via variational principles. Our analysis reveals fundamental geometric obstructions, identified here as an anisotropic Balian-Low phenomenon, which preclude the existence of tight frames for isotropic generators in high-shear regimes. Furthermore, we apply these results to determine sharp constants for Sobolev embeddings, explicitly quantifying the impact of dilation geometry on analytic stability.</description>

      <title>Maximal averages and non-transversality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $L^p$ mapping properties of maximal functions associated with analytic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^d$, with a particular emphasis on the role of transversality. Around points that are not transversal, we show that the associated maximal function is bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^d)$ for all $p&gt;2$, regardless of the decay of the Fourier transform of surface measures. In contrast, away from non-transversal points, we prove that $L^p$ bounds for the maximal operator imply that the Fourier transform of the surface measure decays at rate $1/q$ for $q&gt;p$. Combining these two regimes, we demonstrate that the conjecture of Stein and Iosevich-Sawyer on maximal functions could be re-formulated, in the analytic setting, by restricting attention to transversal points. Moreover, our result completely settles the refined form of the conjecture for certain cases.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-order oscillations in geometric discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be a convex body, and let $\mathcal{P}\subset[0,1)^2$ be a set of $N$ points. The discrepancy of $\mathcal{P}$ with respect to $C$ is defined as
  \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{P},\, C)=\sum_{\mathbf{p}\in\mathcal{P}}\sum_{\mathbf{n}\in\mathbb{Z}^2}\mathds{1}_C(\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{n})-N|C|. \end{equation*} A standard approach for estimating how a point distribution deviates from uniformity is to average the latter quantity over a family of sets; in particular, when considering quadratic averages over translations and dilations, one obtains \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{D}_2(\mathcal{P},\, C)=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{[0,1)^2}\left|\mathcal{D}( \mathcal{P},\,\boldsymbol{\tau}+\delta C)\right|^2\,{\rm d}\boldsymbol{\tau}\,{\rm d} \delta. \end{equation*} This paper concerns the behaviour of optimal \textit{homothetic quadratic discrepancy} \begin{equation*}
  \inf_{\# \mathcal{P}=N} \mathcal{D}_2(\mathcal{P},\, C)\quad\text{as}\quad N\to+\infty. \end{equation*} Beck and Chen \cite{MR1489133} showed that the optimal \textit{h.q.d.} of convex polygons has an order of growth of $\log N$. More recently, Brandolini and Travaglini \cite{MR4358540} showed that the optimal \textit{h.q.d.} of planar convex bodies has an order of growth of $N^{1/2}$ if their boundary is $\mathcal{C}^2$, and of $N^{2/5}$ if their boundary is only piecewise-$\mathcal{C}^2$ and not polygonal. We show that, in general, no order of growth is required. First, by an implicit geometric construction, we show that one can obtain prescribed oscillations from a logarithmic order of $\log N$ to polynomial orders of $N^{2/5}$ and $N^{1/2}$, and vice versa. Secondly, by using Fourier-analytic methods, we show that prescribed polynomial-order oscillations in the range $N^\alpha$ with $\alpha\in(2/5,1/2)$ are achievable.</description>

      <title>New discretized polynomial expander and incidence estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two applications of recent developments in incidence geometry. One is a $\delta$-discretized version of a particular `Elekes--R\'onyai' expander problem. For the polynomial we consider, our exponent matches the best known exponent from the discrete case. The second application is an incidence estimate addressing the scenario when both tubes, squares and their shadings satisfy non-concentration assumptions.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev Spaces on Quasicircles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a bounded Jordan curve and $\Omega_i,\Omega_e$ its two complementary components. For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty,\,s\in(0,1)$ we define $\mathcal{B}_{p,p}^s(\Omega_{i,e})$ as the set of functions $f:\Gamma\to \mathbb C$ having harmonic extension $u$ respectively in $\Omega_i$ and $\Omega_e$ such that $$ \iint_{\Omega_{i,e}} |\nabla u(z)|^p d(z,\Gamma)^{(1-s)p-1} dxdy&lt;+\infty.$$ If $\Gamma$ is further assumed to be rectifiable we define $B_{p,p}^s(\Gamma)$ as the space of functions $f\in L^p(\Gamma)$ such that $$\iint_{\Gamma\times \Gamma}\frac{|f(z)-f(\zeta)|^p}{|z-\zeta|^{1+ps}} |dz||d\zeta|&lt;+\infty.$$ When $\Gamma$ is the unit circle these three spaces coincide with the homogeneous fractional Besov-Sobolev space. For a general rectifiable curve these spaces need not coincide and our first goal is to investigate the cases of equality: while the chord-arc property is the necessary and sufficient condition for equality in the classical case of $s=1/p,\, p\ge 2$, this is no longer the case for general $s\in (0,1)$. We show however that equality holds for radial-Lipschitz curves. In the general (possibly non-rectifiable) case we study boundary values of functions in $\mathcal{B}_{p,p}^s(\Omega_{i,e})$ and give conditions for equality of these trace-spaces that we then call $\mathcal{B}^s_{p,p}(\Gamma)$. Using Plemelj-Calder\'on property we further identify $\mathcal{B}^s_{p,p}(\Gamma)$ with the space of restrictions of a weighted Sobolev space of the plane. Finally we re-interpretate some of our results as the "almost"-Dirichlet principle in the spirit of Maz'ya.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Functions can Exactly Quantify Rate Performance of Nonlinear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pointwise-in-time stability notions for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) provide quantitative metrics for system performance by establishing bounds on the rate of decay of the system state in terms of initial condition -- allowing stability to be quantified by e.g. the maximum provable decay rate. Such bounds may be obtained by finding suitable Lyapunov functions using, e.g. Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization. While Lyapunov tests have been proposed for numerous pointwise-in-time stability notions, including exponential, rational, and finite-time stability, it is unclear whether these characterizations are able to provide accurate bounds on system performance.
  In this paper, we start by proposing a generalized notion of rate performance -- with exponential, rational, and finite-time decay rates being special cases. Then, for any such notion and rate, we associate a Lyapunov condition which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for a system to achieve that rate. Finally, we show how the proposed conditions can be enforced using SOS programming in the case of exponential, rational, and finite-time stability. Numerical examples in each case demonstrate that the corresponding SOS test can achieve tight bounds on the rate performance with accurate inner bounds on the associated regions of performance.</description>

      <title>Lamperti Operators, Dilation Theory, and Applications in Noncommutative Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel framework for quantitative mean ergodic theorems in the noncommutative setting, with a focus on actions of amenable groups and semigroups. We prove square function inequalities for ergodic averages arising from actions of groups of polynomial volume growth on a fixed noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1&lt;p&lt;\8$. To achieve this, we establish two endpoint estimates for a noncommutative square function on non-homogeneous space. Our approach relies on semi-commutative non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, including the non-doubling Calder\'on-Zygmund arguments for non-smooth kernels and $\mathrm{BMO}$ space theory, operator-valued inequalities related to balls and cubes in groups equipped with non-doubling measures, and a noncommutative generalization of the classical transference method for amenable group actions. As an application, we establish a quantitative ergodic theorem for the ergodic averages associated with the positive power of modulus representation arising from a Lamperti representation on noncommutative $L_p$-spaces, extending some results in \cite{Templeman2015}. To obtain quantitative ergodic theorem for semigroups of operators, in this paper, we address the open question of extending dilation theorem of Fackler-Gl\"uck from single operators to commuting tuples on Banach spaces including noncommutative $L_p$-spaces. Indeed our approach provides genuine joint $N$-dilations for commuting families, unifying and extending the classical dilation theorems of Sz.-Nagy--Foia\c{s} and Ak\c{c}oglu--Sucheston for a natural class of commuting tuple of contractions extending the abstract dilation theorem of of Fackler-Gl\"uck for commuting tuple of contractions. This enables us to obtain a quantitative ergodic theorem for a large class of semigroups of operators on $\mathbb{R}^d_{+}$.</description>

      <title>Another look at regularity in transport-commutator estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in how regular a transport velocity field must be in order to control Riesz-type commutators. Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2&lt; s&lt;d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of Laurent multiple orthogonality on the unit circle and define Angelesco and AT systems in this setting. Using a generalized Andreief identity, we establish normality of all multi-indices for any such system, thereby ensuring existence and uniqueness of Laurent multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II at every location. As an application, we demonstrate existence and uniqueness of the approximants for two natural two-point Hermite-Pad\'e problems -- type I and type II -- arising in the simultaneous rational approximation of $r$ Carath\'{e}odory functions.</description>

      <title>A Chebyshev criterion for at most two non-zero limit cycles in Abel equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the maximum number of limit cycles of the reduced Abel equation $\dot{x}=A(t)x^{3}+B(t)x^{2}$ on an interval $[0,T]$.
  The Smale-Pugh problem asks whether this maximum number is bounded in terms of a given class of coefficients.
  We establish for the first time a Chebyshev criterion, providing a positive answer to the problem when this class spanned by an extended Chebyshev system (ET-system) $\mathcal{F}=\{f_{0},f_{1},f_{2}\}$ on $[0,T)$ with $f_{0}\not=0$.
  As an application, we prove that the equation has at most three limit cycles (including $x=0$) when the coefficients $A$ and $B$ are both linear trigonometric functions or quadratic polynomials. This reestablishes the result of Yu et al. (J. Differ. Equ., 2024) and improves the work of Bravo et al. (Disc. Cont. Dyn. Syst., 2015 \&amp; J. Differ. Equ., 2024). We also obtain the same maximum number of limit cycles for the equation with trinomial coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ be a strictly increasing smooth function, such that $f'$ is comparable to a weight $\alpha'$ which is locally doubling and satisfies a non-triviality condition to be explained in the paper. We construct a meromorphic inner function $J$, such that $f-\arg(J)$ is bounded and $\arg(J)'$ is comparable to $\alpha'$ up to polynomial loss. We give two applications of this result. The first is a sufficient density condition for a set $\Lambda$ to be a zero set for a Toeplitz kernel with real analytic and unimodular symbol. Our second application is to describe a class of admissible Beurling-Malliavin majorants in model spaces. The generality considered here lets us treat most cases of model spaces generated by one-component inner functions.</description>

      <title>The Stein-Weiss inequality in variable exponent Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the Stein-Weiss inequality in variable exponent Morrey spaces over a bounded domain. Our work extends earlier results in the variable exponent Lebesgue and Morrey settings, and utilizes new proof techniques applicable to Morrey spaces. We build on the foundational paper by Almeida, Hasanov, and Samko, which introduced Morrey spaces of variable exponents. As an application of our main result, we prove Poincar\'e-type inequalities using the approach of a recent paper by the first and third authors.</description>

      <title>On local smoothing estimates for wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp local smoothing estimates for wave equations on compact Riemannian manifolds in $n+1$ dimensions for odd $n$ and obtain improved estimates in even dimensions. This is achieved by deriving local smoothing estimates for certain Fourier integral operators. We also obtain improved local smoothing estimates for wave equations in Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Residue sums for superconformal indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study superconformal indices of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetry. The usual representation of a gauge theory index involves multiple contour integrals and reflects the BPS spectrum at zero Yang-Mills coupling. To find an alternative, closed form expression, it is natural to attempt an evaluation of the integrals through residues. However, the presence of non-isolated essential singularities prevents a straightforward evaluation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the Macdonald index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(2)$ super Yang--Mills theory, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. We observe that the simplified form encodes features of the BPS spectrum at non-zero coupling and suggests the absence of fortuitous or non-graviton operators in the Macdonald sector. Furthermore, we evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form.</description>

      <title>On the Riemann-Hilbert problem for hyperplane arrangements with a good line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Riemann-Hilbert problem on the complements of hyperplane arrangements. This problem asks whether a given local system on the complement can be realized as the solution sheaf of a logarithmic Pfaffian system with constant coefficients. In this paper, we generalize Katz's middle convolution as a functor for local systems on hyperplane complements and show that it preserves the solvability of this problem.</description>
