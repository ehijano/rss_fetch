      <title>Modeling the Galactic Chemical Evolution of Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of $^4$He in one-zone and multi-zone models, with particular attention to theoretical predictions and empirical constraints on IMF-averaged yields. Published models of massive star winds and core collapse supernovae span a factor of 2 -- 3 in the IMF-averaged $^4$He yield, $y\mathrm{_{He}^{CC}}$. Published models of intermediate mass, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars show better agreement on the IMF-averaged yield, $y\mathrm{_{He}^{AGB}}$, and they predict that more than half of this yield comes from stars with $M=4-8 M_\odot$, making AGB $^4$He enrichment rapid compared to Fe enrichment from Type Ia supernovae. Although our GCE models include many potentially complicating effects, the short enrichment time delay and mild metallicity dependence of the predicted yields makes the results quite simple: across a wide range of metallicity and age, the non-primordial $^4$He mass fraction $\Delta Y = Y-Y_{\mathrm{P}}$ is proportional to the abundance of promptly produced $\alpha$-elements, like oxygen, with $\Delta Y/Z_{\mathrm{O}} \approx (y\mathrm{_{He}^{CC}}+y\mathrm{_{He}^{AGB}})/y\mathrm{_{O}^{CC}}$. Reproducing solar abundances with our fiducial choice of the oxygen yield $y\mathrm{_{O}^{CC}}=0.0071$ implies $y\mathrm{_{He}^{CC}}+y\mathrm{_{He}^{AGB}} \approx 0.022$, i.e., $0.022M_\odot$ of net $^4$He production per solar mass of star formation. Our GCE models with this yield normalization are consistent with most available observations, though the implied $y\mathrm{_{He}^{CC}}$ is low compared to most of the published massive star models. More precise measurements of $\Delta Y$ in stars and gas across a wide range of metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio could test our models more stringently, either confirming the simple picture suggested by our calculations or revealing surprises in the evolution of the second most abundant element.</description>

      <title>Eccentric binaries: Periastron events and tidal heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periastron brightening events, also known as the heartbeat phenomenon, are a clear manifestation of interaction effects in binary systems. We explore the role of tidal shear energy dissipation in stars undergoing periastron brightening events by performing a computation from first principles that uses a quasi-hydrodynamic Lagrangian scheme to simultaneously solve the orbital motion and the equations of motion of a 3D grid of volume elements covering the inner, rigidly rotating region of a tidally perturbed star. The equations of motion include the gravitational acceleration of both stars, the centrifugal, Coriolis, gas pressure accelerations, and viscous coupling between volume elements. The method is illustrated for a grid of model binary systems with a 10 M$_\odot$ primary that is perturbed by a 6.97 M$_\odot$ companion in eccentric orbits (e=0 $-$ 0.7). The model is then applied to the heartbeat star MACHO 80.7443.1718.
  We find an increase by factors 10$^{-6}$ $-$10$^{-3}$ in tidal shear energy dissipation at periastron, consistent with the majority of observed heartbeat stars. The magnitude of the periastron effect correlates with the degree of departure from synchronicity: stars rotating much faster or much slower than the synchronous rate at periastron present the strongest effect. We confirm that for eccentricities $\leq$0.3, pseudo-synchronization occurs for 0.8$&lt; \omega/\Omega_{ave} &lt;$1, where $\Omega_{ave}$ is the average orbital angular velocity. However, we find that the rotation rate with minimum energy for e=0.5 and 0.7 occurs for $\omega/\Omega_{ave}&gt;$1 . The tidal shear energy dissipation model reproduces from first principles the 23% maximum brightness enhancement at periastron of MACHO 80.7443.1718. The extraordinarily large hearbeat amplitude is likely due to a rotation rate that differs considerably from the synchronous rate at periastron.</description>

      <title>The Population of Massive Stars in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST: Detection of Wolf-Rayet stars injecting nitrogen into a low-metallicity, $z=2.37$ proto-globular cluster leaking ionizing photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a population of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Sunburst Arc, a strongly gravitationally lensed galaxy at redshift $z=2.37$. As the brightest known lensed galaxy, the Sunburst Arc has become an important cosmic laboratory for studying star and cluster formation, Lyman $\alpha$ radiative transfer, and Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape. Here, we present the first results of JWST/NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec IFU observations of the Sunburst Arc, focusing on a stacked spectrum of the 12-fold imaged LyC-emitting (Sunburst LCE) cluster. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the cluster is massive and compact, with $M_{\text{dyn}} = (9\pm1) \times 10^{6} M_{\odot}$, Our age estimate of 4.2--4.5 Myr is much larger than the crossing time of $t_{\text{cross}} = 183 \pm 9 $ kyr, indicating that the cluster is dynamically evolved and consistent with being gravitationally bound. We find a significant nitrogen enhancement of the low ionization state ISM, with $\log(N/O) = -0.74 \pm 0.09$, which is $\approx 0.8$ dex above typical values for H II regions of similar metallicity in the local Universe. We find broad stellar emission complexes around He II$\lambda 4686$ and C IV$\lambda 5808$ with associated nitrogen emission -- this is the first time WR signatures have been directly observed at redshifts above $\sim 0.5$. The strength of the WR signatures cannot be reproduced by stellar population models that only include single-star evolution. While models with binary evolution better match the WR features, they still struggle to reproduce the nitrogen-enhanced WR features. JWST reveals the Sunburst LCE to be a highly ionized, proto-globular cluster with low oxygen abundance and extreme nitrogen enhancement that hosts a population of Wolf-Rayet stars, and possibly Very Massive stars (VMSs), which are rapidly enriching the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Growing a nuclear star cluster from star formation and cluster mergers: The JWST NIRSpec view of NGC 4654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the centre of NGC4654, a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy in the Virgo cluster that has been reported to host a double stellar nucleus, thus promising a rare view of ongoing star cluster infall into a galaxy nucleus. Analysing JWST NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopic data and Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the inner 330 $\times$ 330 pc, we find that the nucleus harbours in fact three massive star clusters. Maps of infrared emission lines from NIRSpec show different morphologies for the ionised and molecular gas components. The emission from molecular hydrogen gas is concentrated at the NSC location, while emission from hydrogen recombination lines is more extended beyond the central cluster. The velocity fields of both gas and stars indicate that the three clusters are part of a complicated dynamical system, with the NSC having an elevated velocity dispersion in line with its high stellar mass. To investigate the stellar populations of the three clusters in more detail, we use surface brightness modelling to measure their fluxes from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths and fit their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Two of the clusters are UV-bright and well described by single stellar populations with young ages ($\sim$ 3 and 5 Myr) and low masses ($M_\ast \sim 4 \times 10^{4} - 10^{5} M_\odot$), whereas the central cluster is much more massive ($3 \times 10^7 M_\odot$), and cannot be fitted by a single stellar population. Instead, we find that a minor young population ($\sim$ 1 Myr) embedded in a dominant old population ($\sim$ 8 Gyr) is needed to explain its SED. Given its complex composition and the close proximity of two young star clusters that are likely to merge with it within a few hundred million years, we consider NGC4654 a unique laboratory to study NSC growth from both in-situ star formation and the infall of star clusters.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the first-infall history of the LMC through its dynamical impact in the Milky Way halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational interactions between the LMC and the Milky Way can give rise to dynamical perturbations in the MW halo, leading to a biased distribution of stellar density and other kinematic signals. These disequilibrium phenomena exhibit variations under different parameter combinations of the MW-LMC model. In this work, we run 50 high-resolution N-body simulations spanning different masses and halo shapes of the Milky Way and LMC and investigate how the LMC-induced perturbations evolve with these model parameters. We measure the magnitude of kinematic perturbations from the mean velocities of simulated halo stars and identify a discontinuity between the first-infall and second-passage scenarios of the LMC's orbital history. We demonstrate that, due to the short dynamical times of the Galactic inner halo, the reduced perturbation magnitude in the second-passage scenario is mainly a result of the LMC's second infall into the MW, which starts at a much lower velocity relative to the inner halo compared to the first-infall scenario. Using a subset of $\sim 1200$ RR Lyrae stars located in the outer halo ($50 \leq R_{\mathrm{GC}} &lt; 100$ kpc), which are selected from a larger sample of 135,873 RR Lyrae stars with precise distance estimates from Gaia, we find the mean latitudinal velocity ($v_{b}$) in the heliocentric frame to be $\langle v_{b} \rangle = 30.8 \pm 4.0$ km/s. The observation contradicts the second-passage scenario and supports the first-infall scenario with a massive LMC ($\sim 2.1 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) at infall, an oblate MW halo with a virial mass $M_{200} &lt; 1.4 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and a flattening parameter $q &gt; 0.7$.</description>

      <title>On the universal validity of Case B recombination theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an ongoing search for low-mass extreme emission line galaxies, we identified a galaxy with a Ha/Hb Balmer line ratio of 2.620 +- 0.078. Ha/Hb Balmer ratios lower than the dust-free Case~B value appear relatively frequently in extreme emission line galaxies. These low values suggest that the Case~B assumption may not be valid in these objects. After ruling out the possibility that the low Ha/Hb ratio is due to systematic errors introduced by observational effects, we use constraints from the total Hb luminosity, the [OIII]/[OII] line ratio and the Balmer line equivalent widths, to suggest that the gas is optically thick to both Ha and Lya photons, and the geometry and orientation of the scattering gas causes Ha photons to be preferentially removed from the line of sight with respect to higher order Balmer series photons. Finally, we use data from the SDSS survey to show that Balmer self-absorption may be more important than previously assumed in high excitation emission line galaxies, where Lya pumping of the hydrogen excited state can be effective. If not recognized, Balmer self-absorption could lead to inaccurate estimates of galaxy physical properties. As an example, the effect of dust extinction could be over-estimated, for spherically symmetric scattering medium, or under-estimated, for a not spherically-symmetric distribution.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT and ALMA view of the AGAL045.804-0.356 clump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of the GAL045.804-0.356 massive star-forming clump. A high-angular resolution and sensitivity observations were conducted using MeerKAT at 1.28 GHz and ALMA interferometer at 1.3 mm. Two distinct centimetre radio continuum emissions (source A and source B) were identified within the clump. A comprehensive investigation was carried out on source A, the G45.804-0.355 star-forming region (SFR) due to its association with Extended Green Object (EGO), 6.7 GHz methanol maser and the spatial coincidence with the peak of the dust continuum emission at 870 $\mu$m. The ALMA observations revealed seven dense dust condensations (MM1 to MM7) in source A. The brightest ($S_{\rm \nu} \sim$ 87 mJy) and massive main dense core, MM1, was co-located with the 6.7 GHz methanol maser. Explorations into the kinematics revealed gas motions characterised by a velocity gradient across the MM1 core. Furthermore, molecular line emission showed the presence of an extended arm-like structure, with a physical size of 0.25 pc $\times$ 0.18 pc ($\sim$ 50000 au $\times$ 30000 au) at a distance of 7.3 kpc. Amongst these arms, two arms were prominently identified in both the dust continuum and some of the molecular lines. A blue-shifted absorption P-Cygni profile was seen in the H$_2$CO line spectrum. The findings of this study are both intriguing and new, utilising data from MeerKAT and ALMA to investigate the characteristics of the AGAL45 clump. The evidence of spiral arms, the compact nature of the EGO and $&lt;$ 2 km s$^{-1}$ velocity gradient are all indicative of G45.804-0.355 being oriented face-on.</description>

      <title>The Timescales of Star Cluster Emergence: The Case of NGC 4449</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the young star cluster population in the dwarf galaxy NGC4449 with the goal of investigating how stellar feedback may depend on the clusters' properties. Using Ultraviolet(UV)-optical-NearIR(NIR) photometry obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have recovered 99 compact sources exhibiting emission in the Pa$\beta$ hydrogen recombination line. Our analysis reveals these sources possess masses $10^{2}&lt;M_{\odot}&lt;10^{5}$, ages 1-20 Myr, and color excess E(B - V) in the range 0-1.4. After selecting clusters with mass above 3,000M$_{\odot}$ to mitigate stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, we find that our IR-selected clusters have a median mass of $\sim$7$\times{10^{3}\text{ M}_{\odot}}$ and remain embedded in their surrounding gas and dust for 5-6 Myr. In contrast, line-emitting sources selected from existing UV/optically catalogs have a median mass of $\sim$3.5$\times{10^{4}\text{ M}_{\odot}}$ and have cleared their surroundings by 4 Myr. We further find that the environment in NGC4449 is too low pressure to drive these differences. We interpret these findings as evidence that the clearing timescale from pre-supernova and supernova feedback is cluster mass-dependent. Even in clusters with mass$\sim$7,000~M$_{\odot}$, stochastic sampling of the upper end of the stellar initial mass function is present, randomly decreasing the number of massive stars available to inject energy and momentum into the surrounding medium. This effect may increase the clearing timescales in these clusters by decreasing the effectiveness of both pre-supernova and supernova feedback; neither models nor observations have so far explored such dependence explicitly. Future studies and observations with, e.g., the JWST, will fill this gap.</description>

      <title>A search for intermediate-mass black holes in compact stellar systems through optical emissions from tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) are expected to exist in globular clusters (GCs) and compact stellar systems (CSS) in general, but none have been conclusively detected. Tidal disruption events (TDEs), where a star is tidally disrupted by the gravitational field of a black hole, have been observed to occur around the supermassive black holes (SMBH) found at the centres of galaxies, and should also arise around IMBHs, especially in the dense stellar cores of CSS's. However, to date none have been observed in such environments. Using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) we search for TDEs associated with CSS, but none are found. This non-detection allows us to set an upper limit on the TDE rate in CSS of $n_\text{TDE,Total}\lessapprox10^{-7} CSS^{-1}\text{yr}^{-1}$ which is two dex. below the observed TDE rate involving SMBH interacting with 1\Msun\ main sequence stars in the nuclei of massive galaxies. We also consider ultra compact dwarfs (UCDs) formed through a tidal stripping process in the surveyed volume. On the assumption these CSS contain SMBH and TDE rates are comparable to current observed optical rates in galactic nuclei ($\approx\num{3.2E-5}\text{gal}^{-1}\text{yr}^{-1}$), we determine an upper limit for the number of UCDs formed through a tidal stripping process in the surveyed volume to be $N_\text{GC, Strip}&lt;\num{1.4E4}$, which we estimate represents $&lt; 6\%$ of the population of GCs $&gt;10^6\Msun$.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All IX. Sulfur elemental abundance in the Orion Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main problems in astrochemistry is determining the amount of sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the interstellar medium. The detection of the main sulfur reservoirs (icy H$_2$S and atomic gas) has been challenging, and estimates are based on the reliability of models to account for the abundances of species containing less than 1% of the total sulfur. The high sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope provides an unprecedented opportunity to estimate the sulfur abundance through the observation of the [S I] 25.249 $\mu$m line. We used the [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m, [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m, and [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m lines to estimate the amount of sulfur in the ionized and molecular gas along the Orion Bar. For the theoretical part, we used an upgraded version of the Meudon photodissociation region (PDR) code to model the observations. New inelastic collision rates of neutral atomic sulfur with ortho- and para- molecular hydrogen were calculated to predict the line intensities. The [S III] 18.7 $\mu$m and [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m lines are detected over the imaged region with a shallow increase (by a factor of 4) toward the HII region. We estimate a moderate sulfur depletion, by a factor of $\sim$2, in the ionized gas. The corrugated interface between the molecular and atomic phases gives rise to several edge-on dissociation fronts we refer to as DF1, DF2, and DF3. The [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is only detected toward DF2 and DF3, the dissociation fronts located farthest from the HII region. The detailed modeling of DF3 using the Meudon PDR code shows that the emission of the [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is coming from warm ($&gt;$ 40 K) molecular gas located at A$_{\rm V}$ $\sim$ 1$-$5 mag from the ionization front. Moreover, the intensity of the [S l] 25.249 $\mu$m line is only accounted for if we assume the presence of undepleted sulfur.</description>

      <title>FEASTS Combined with Interferometry (I): Overall Properties of Diffuse HI and Implications for Gas Accretion in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical study of the properties of diffuse HI in ten nearby galaxies, comparing the HI detected by the single-dish telescope FAST (FEASTS program) and the interferometer VLA (THINGS program), respectively. The THINGS' observation missed HI with a median of 23% due to the short-spacing problem of interferometry and limited sensitivity. We extract the diffuse HI by subtracting the dense HI, which is obtained from the THINGS data with a uniform flux-density threshold, from the total HI detected by FAST. Among the sample, the median diffuse-HI fraction is 34%, and more diffuse HI is found in galaxies exhibiting more prominent tidal-interaction signatures. The diffuse HI we detected seems to be distributed in disk-like layers within a typical thickness of $1\,\text{kpc}$, different from the more halo-like diffuse HI detected around NGC 4631 in a previous study. Most of the diffuse HI is cospatial with the dense HI and has a typical column density of $10^{17.7}$-$10^{20.1}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. The diffuse and dense HI exhibits a similar rotational motion, but the former lags by a median of 25% in at least the inner disks, and its velocity dispersions are typically twice as high. Based on a simplified estimation of circum-galactic medium properties and assuming pressure equilibrium, the volume density of diffuse HI appears to be constant within each individual galaxy, implying its role as a cooling interface. Comparing with existing models, these results are consistent with a possible link between tidal interactions, the formation of diffuse HI, and gas accretion.</description>

      <title>The Physalis system: Discovery of ORC-like radio shells around a massive pair of interacting early-type galaxies with offset X-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of large radio shells around a massive pair of interacting galaxies and extended diffuse X-ray emission within the shells. The radio data were obtained with the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in two frequency bands centred at 944 MHz and 1.4 GHz, respectively, while the X-ray data are from the XMM-Newton observatory. The host galaxy pair, which consists of the early-type galaxies ESO 184-G042 and LEDA 418116, is part of a loose group at a distance of only 75 Mpc (redshift z = 0.017). The observed outer radio shells (diameter ~ 145 kpc) and ridge-like central emission of the system, ASKAP J1914-5433 (Physalis), are likely associated with merger shocks during the formation of the central galaxy (ESO 184-G042) and resemble the new class of odd radio circles (ORCs). This is supported by the brightest X-ray emission found offset from the centre of the Physalis system, instead centered at the less massive galaxy, LEDA 418116. The host galaxy pair is embedded in an irregular envelope of diffuse light, highlighting on-going interactions. We complement our combined radio and X-ray study with high-resolution simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxy mergers from the Magneticum project to analyse the evolutionary state of the Physalis system. We argue that ORCs / radio shells could be produced by a combination of energy release from the central AGN and subsequent lightening up in radio emission by merger shocks traveling through the CGM of these systems.</description>

      <title>The "C": The large Chameleon-Musca-Coalsack cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D dust mapping have transformed our understanding of the Milky Way's local interstellar medium (ISM), enabling us to explore its structure in three spatial dimensions for the first time. In this letter, we use the Edenhofer et al. (2023) 3D dust map to study the well-known Chameleon, Musca, and Coalsack cloud complexes, located about 200 pc from the Sun. We find that these three complexes are not isolated but rather connect to form a surprisingly well-defined half-ring, constituting a single "C"-shaped cloud with a radius of about 50 pc, a thickness of about 45 pc, and a total mass of about $9 \times 10^{4}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Despite the absence of an evident feedback source at its center, the dynamics of young stellar clusters associated with the "C" structure suggest that a single supernova explosion about 4 Myr to 10 Myr ago likely shaped this structure. Our findings support a single origin story for these cloud complexes, suggesting that they were formed by feedback-driven gas compression. This interpretation challenges scenarios in which magnetic fields are the primary drivers behind the formation of star-forming molecular clouds in this region, offering new insights into the processes that govern the birth of star-forming clouds in feedback-dominated regions, such as Sco-Cen.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of strong 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 Balmer and Paschen lines emitters observed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultraviolet continuum traces young stars while the near-infrared unveils older stellar populations and dust-obscured regions. Balmer emission lines provide insights on gas properties and young stellar objects but are highly affected by dust attenuation. The near-infrared Paschen lines suffer less dust attenuation and can be used to measure star formation rates (SFRs) in star-forming regions obscured by dust clouds. We select 13 sources between redshifts 1 and 3 observed with HST, JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec based on the availability of at least one Balmer and one Paschen line with S/N &gt; 5. With a newly-developed version of CIGALE, we fit their hydrogen line equivalent widths (EWs) and photometric data. We assess the impacts of the removal of spectroscopic data by comparing the quality of the fits of the spectro-photometric data to those with photometric data only. We compare the single (BC03) vs binary (BPASS) stellar populations models in the fitting process of spectro-photometric data. We derive the differential attenuation and explore different attenuation recipes by fitting spectro-photometric data with BC03. For each stellar model and for each input dataset (with and without EWs), we quantify the deviation on the SFRs and stellar masses from the "standard" choice. On average, the SFRs are overestimated and the stellar masses are underestimated when EWs are not included as input data. We find a major contribution of the H${\alpha}$ emission line to the broadband photometric measurements of our sources, and a trend of increasing contribution with specific SFR. Using the BPASS models has a significant impact on the derived SFRs and stellar masses. We show that a flexible attenuation recipe provides more accurate estimates of the dust attenuation parameters, especially the differential attenuation which agrees with the original value of Charlot &amp; Fall (2000).</description>

      <title>Cluster analysis of the Roma-BZCAT blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the collected multiwavelength data, namely in the radio (NVSS, FIRST, RATAN-600), IR (WISE), optical (Pan-STARRS), UV (GALEX), and X-ray (ROSAT, Swift-XRT) ranges, we have performed a cluster analysis for the blazars of the Roma-BZCAT catalog. Using two machine learning methods, namely a combination of PCA with k-means clustering and Kohonen's self-organizing maps, we have constructed an independent classification of the blazars (five classes) and compared the classes with the known Roma-BZCAT classification (FSRQs, BL Lacs, galaxy-dominated BL Lacs, and blazars of an uncertain type) as well as with the high synchrotron peaked blazars (HSP) from the 3HSP catalog and blazars from the TeVCat catalog. The obtained groups demonstrate concordance with the BL Lac/FSRQ classification along with a continuous character of the change in the properties. The group of HSP blazars stands out against the overall distribution. We examine the characteristics of the five groups and demonstrate distinctions in their spectral energy distribution shapes. The effectiveness of the clustering technique for objective analysis of multiparametric arrays of experimental data is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-wave CO and SiO Observations toward the Broad-velocity-width Molecular Feature CO 16.134-0.553: a Smith cloud scenario?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of the CO $\textit J$=1-0 and SiO $\textit J$=2-1 mapping observations towards the broad-velocity-width molecular feature CO 16.134-0.553 with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope. The high quality CO map shows that the 5-pc size broad-velocity-width feature bridges two separate velocity components at $\textit V_{\rm{LSR}}$$\quad$$\simeq$ 40 km s$^{-1}$ and 65 km s$^{-1}$ in the position-velocity space. The kinetic power of CO 16.134-0.553 amounts to $7.8\times10^2$ $\textit L$$_\odot$ whereas no apparent driving sources were identified. Prominent SiO emission was detected from the broad-velocity-width feature and its root in the $\textit V_{\rm{LSR}}$$\quad$$\simeq$ 40 km s$^{-1}$ component. In the CO Galactic plane survey data, CO 16.134-0.553 appears to correspond to the Galactic eastern rim of a 15-pc diameter expanding CO shell. An $1\deg$-diameter H I emission void and $4\deg$-long vertical H I filament were also found above and below the CO shell, respectively. We propose that the high-velocity plunge of a dark matter subhalo with a clump of baryonic matter was responsible for the formation of the H I void, CO 16.134-0.553/CO shell, and the H I filament.</description>

      <title>Astrochemistry of the molecular gas in Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at the Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FIR and submm observations have established the fundamental role of dust-obscured star formation in the assembly of stellar mass over the past 12 billion years. At z between 2 and 4, the bulk of star formation is enshrouded in dust, and dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) contain about half of the total stellar mass density. Star formation develops in dense molecular clouds, and is regulated by a complex interplay between all the ISM components that contribute to the energy budget of a galaxy: gas, dust, cosmic rays, interstellar electromagnetic fields, gravitational field, dark matter. Molecular gas is the actual link between star forming gas and its complex environment, providing by far the richest amount of information about the star formation process. However, molecular lines interpretation requires complex modeling of astrochemical networks, which regulate the molecular formation and establishes molecular abundances in a cloud, and a modeling of the physical conditions of the gas in which molecular energy levels become populated. This paper critically reviews the main astrochemical parameters needed to get predictions about molecular signals in DSFGs. We review the current knowledge and the open questions about the interstellar medium of DSFGs, outlying the key role of molecular gas as a tracer and shaper of the star formation process.</description>

      <title>Multi-transition study of methanol towards NGC 1068 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outflowing molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk (CND) of the nearby (D=14 Mpc) AGN-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068 is considered as a manifestation of ongoing AGN feedback. The large spread of velocities from the outflowing gas is likely driving various kinds of shock chemistry across the CND. We performed a multiline molecular study using CH3OH with the aim of characterizing the gas properties probed by CH3OH in the CND of NGC 1068, and investigating its potential association with molecular shocks. Multi-transition CH3OH were imaged at the resolution of 0.''5-0.''8 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We performed non-LTE radiative transfer analysis coupled with a Bayesian inference process in order to determine the gas properties such as the gas volume density and the gas kinetic temperature. The gas densities traced by CH3OH point to $\sim 10^{6}$ cm\textsuperscript{-3} across all the CND regions. The gas kinetic temperature cannot be well constrained in any of the CND regions though the inferred temperature is likely low ($\lesssim 100$ K).The low gas temperature traced by CH3OH suggests shocks and subsequent fast cooling as the origin of the observed gas-phase CH3OH abundance. We also note that the E-/A- isomer column density ratio inferred is fairly close to unity, which is interestingly different from the Galactic measurements in the literature. It remains inconclusive whether CH3OH exclusively traces slow and non-dissociative shocks, or whether the CH3OH abundance can actually be boosted in both fast and slow shocks.</description>

      <title>Simulating nearby disc galaxies on the main star formation sequence I. Bar formation and the building of the central gas reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past studies have long emphasised the key role played by galactic stellar bars in the context of disc secular evolution, via the redistribution of gas and stars, the triggering of star formation, and the formation of prominent structures such as rings and central mass concentrations. However, the exact physical processes acting on those structures, as well as the timescales associated with the building and consumption of central gas reservoirs are still not well understood. We are building a suite of hydro-dynamical RAMSES simulations of isolated, low-redshift galaxies that mimic the properties of the PHANGS sample. The initial conditions of the models reproduce the observed stellar mass, disc scale length, or gas fraction, and this paper presents a first subset of these models. Most of our simulated galaxies develop a prominent bar structure, which itself triggers central gas fuelling and the building of an over-density with a typical scale of 100-1000 pc. We confirm that if the host galaxy features an ellipsoidal component, the formation of the bar and gas fuelling are delayed. We show that most of our simulations follow a common time evolution, when accounting for mass scaling and the bar formation time. In our simulations, the stellar mass of $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$ seems to mark a change in the phases describing the time evolution of the bar and its impact on the interstellar medium. In massive discs (M$_{\star} \geq 10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$), we observe the formation of a central gas reservoir with star formation mostly occurring within a restricted starburst region, leading to a gas depletion phase. Lower-mass systems (M$_{\star} &lt; 10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$) do not exhibit such a depletion phase, and show a more homogeneous spread of star-forming regions along the bar structure, and do not appear to host inner bar-driven discs or rings.</description>

      <title>Mapping the anisotropic Galactic stellar halo with Blue Horizontal Branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Legacy Survey photometric data to probe the stellar halo in multiple directions of the sky using a probabilistic methodology to identify Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) stars. The measured average radial density profile follows a double power law in the range $ 5 &lt; r_{gc}/{\rm kpc} &lt; 120$, with a density break at $r_{gc}\approx20$ kpc. This description, however, falls short, depending on the chosen line-of-sight, with some regions showing no signature of a break in the profile and a wide range of density slopes, e.g. outer slope $-5.5 \lesssim \alpha_{out} \lesssim -4$, pointing towards a highly anisotropic stellar halo. This explains in part the wide range of density profiles reported in the literature owing to different tracers and sky coverage. Using our detailed 3-D stellar halo density map, we quantify the shape of the Pisces overdensity associated with the transient wake response of the Galaxy's (dark) halo to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Measured in the LMC's coordinate system, Pisces stands above the background, is 60 degrees long and 25 degrees wide and aligned with the LMC's orbit. This would correspond to a wake width of $\sim 32$ kpc at $\sim 70$ kpc. We do not find a statistically significant signature of the collective response in density as previously reported in the literature measured with K giant stars, despite our larger numbers. We release the catalogue constructed in this study with 95,446 possible BHB stars and their BHB probability.</description>

      <title>Finding Lensed Radio Sources with the VLA Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations of strongly lensed objects are valuable as cosmological probes. Lensed radio sources have proven difficult to identify in large part due to the limited depth and angular resolution of the previous generation of radio sky surveys, and as such, only a few dozen lensed radio sources are known. In this work we present the results of a pilot study using the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) in combination with optical data to more efficiently identify lensed radio sources. We obtain high-resolution (0.2") VLA follow-up observations for 11 targets that we identify using three different techniques: i) a search for compact radio sources offset from galaxies with high lensing potential, ii) VLASS detections of known lensed galaxies, iii) VLASS detections of known lensed quasars. 5 of our targets show radio emission from the lensed images, including 100% of the lensed optical quasar systems. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining deep and high-resolution wide-area radio and optical survey data to efficiently find lensed radio sources, and we discuss the potential impact of such an approach using next-generation surveys with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>From VIPERS to SDSS: Unveiling galaxy spectra evolution over 9 Gyr through unsupervised machine-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: This study aims to trace the chronological evolution of galaxy spectra over cosmic time. Focusing on the VIPERS dataset, we seek to understand the diverse population of galaxies within narrow redshift bins, comparing our findings with the previously mapped diversity of SDSS galaxies.
  Methods: We use Fisher-EM, an unsupervised subspace model-based classification algorithm to classify a dataset of 79,224 spectra from the VIPERS. The dataset was divided into 26 samples by bins of redshift ranging from 0.4 - 1.2, which were classified independently. Classes of subsequent bins were linked through the k-Nearest Neighbour method to create a chronological tree of classes at different epochs.
  Results: Based on the optical spectra, three main chronological galaxy branches have emerged: (i) red passive, (ii) blue star-forming, and (iii) very blue, possibly associated with AGN activity. Each of the branches differentiates into sub-branches discriminating finer properties such as D4000 break, colour, star-formation rate, and stellar masses and/or disappear with cosmic time. Notably, these classes align remarkably well with the branches identified in a previous SDSS analysis, indicating a robust and consistent classification across datasets. The chronological "tree" constructed from VIPERS data provides valuable insights into the temporal evolution of these spectral classes.
  Conclusions: The synergy between VIPERS and SDSS datasets enhances our understanding of the evolutionary pathways of galaxy spectra. The remarkable correspondence between independently derived branches in both datasets underscores the reliability of our unsupervised machine-learning approach. The three sub-trees show complex branching structures highlighting different physical and evolutionary behaviours. This study contributes to the broader comprehension of galaxy evolution.</description>

Abstract: The formation and structure of the Milky Way has a fundamental role in our understanding of the universe and its evolution, and thanks to the Gaia mission and large spectroscopic surveys, we live an exceptional moment of data availability, allowing us to trace the building blocks of the Galactic disk and their relations. In this sense, we propose here the exploration of a large dataset in a top-down fashion, elaborating a similarity map of the local Galactic volume in order to segregate and characterise its main components, searching for hints about their relations. We have used the t-SNE algorithm with chemical, orbital and kinematic properties of the stars to produce 2D manifolds and dissect their structure by isolating populations to further analyse their behaviour. The young thin disk could be clearly separated from the older thick disk, also showing a puzzling transition zone with hints about the aftermath of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger. Moving groups and resonant features also appear prominently in the maps, splitting the disk into inner and outer portions as consequence of the resonances produced by the Galactic bar. The dynamical halo appears as an extreme end related to the heated portion of the thick disk, showing sub-structures corresponding to known accreted populations. Open and globular clusters also appear in their chemical/evolutionary context. We present details of the developed strategy, an overview of the different populations and their relations, as well as a discussion and insights of our results in the scenario of Galactic evolution.</description>

      <title>Physical and Chemical Properties of Galactic Molecular Gas toward QSO J1851+0035</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA data toward QSO J1851+0035 ($l$=$33.498^{\circ}$, $b$=$+0.194^{\circ}$) were used to study absorption lines by Galactic molecular gas. We detected 17 species (CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, H$_2$CO, C$_2$H, $c$-C$_3$H, $c$-C$_3$H$_2$, CN, HCN, HNC, CS, SO, SiO, and C) and set upper limits to 18 species as reference values for chemical models. About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7-10.9 kpc from the Galactic Center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with $\tau$ $\lesssim$ 1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO $J$=1-0 and $J$=2-1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio ($\gtrsim$4) reaches $\gtrsim$40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO$^+$ abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller $N$(HCO$^+$) (or lower $A_{\rm V}$) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO$^+$ absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the $\sim$1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO$^+$ abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas).</description>

      <title>Radioastrometry at different frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique allows us to determine positions of thousands of radio sources using the absolute astrometry approach. I have investigated the impact of a selection of observing frequencies in a range from 2 to 43 GHz in single-band, dual-band, and quad-band observing modes on astrometric results. I processed seven datasets in a range of 72 thousands to 6.9 million observations, estimated source positions, and compared them. I found that source positions derived from dual-band, quad-band, and 23.6 GHz single-band data agree at a level below 0.2 mas. Comparison of independent datasets allowed me to assess the error level of individual catalogues: 0.05-0.07 mas per position component. Further comparison showed that individual catalogues have systematic errors at the same level. Positions from 23.6 GHz single-band data show systematic errors related to the residual ionosphere contribution. Analysis of source positions differences revealed systematic errors along the jet direction at a level of 0.09 mas. Network related systematic errors affect all the data regardless of frequency. Comparison of position estimates allowed me to derive the stochastic error model that closes the error budget. Based on collected evidence, I made a conclusion that development of frequency-dependent reference frames of the entire sky is not warranted. In most cases dual-band, quad-band, and single-band data at frequency 22 GHz and higher can be used interchangeably, which allows us to exploit the strength of a specific frequency setup for given objects. Mixing observations at different frequencies causes errors not exceeding 0.07 mas.</description>

      <title>Eddington envelopes: The fate of stars on parabolic orbits tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars falling too close to massive black holes in the centres of galaxies can be torn apart by the strong tidal forces. Simulating the subsequent feeding of the black hole with disrupted material has proved challenging because of the range of timescales involved. Here we report a set of simulations that capture the relativistic disruption of the star, followed by one year of evolution of the returning debris stream. These reveal the formation of an expanding asymmetric bubble of material extending to hundreds of astronomical units -- an Eddington envelope with an optically thick inner region. Such envelopes have been hypothesised as the reprocessing layer needed to explain optical/UV emission in tidal disruption events, but never produced self-consistently in a simulation. Our model broadly matches the observed light curves with low temperatures, faint luminosities, and line widths of 10,000--20,000 km/s.</description>

      <title>Constraints on graviton mass from Schwarzschild precession in the orbits of S-stars around the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use a modification of the Newtonian gravitational potential with a non-linear Yukawa-like correction, as it was proposed by C. Will earlier to obtain new bounds on graviton mass from the observed orbits of S-stars around the Galactic Center (GC). This phenomenological potential differs from the gravitational potential obtained in the weak field limit of Yukawa gravity, which we used in our previous studies. We also assumed that the orbital precession of S-stars is close to the prediction of General Relativity (GR) for Schwarzschild precession, but with a possible small discrepancy from it. This assumption is motivated by the fact that the GRAVITY Collaboration in 2020 and in 2022 detected Schwarzschild precession in the S2 star orbit around the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at the GC. Using this approach, we were able to constrain parameter $\lambda$ of the potential and, assuming that it represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we also found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. The obtained results were then compared with our previous estimates, as well as with the estimates of other authors.</description>

      <title>Black Hole - Neutron Star Binary Mergers: The Impact of Stellar Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave observations include possible detections of black hole - neutron star binary mergers. As with binary black hole mergers, numerical simulations help characterize the sources. For binary systems with neutron star components, the simulations help to predict the imprint of tidal deformations and disruptions on the gravitational wave signals. In a previous study, we investigated how the mass of the black hole has an impact on the disruption of the neutron star and, as a consequence, on the shape of the gravitational waves emitted. We extend these results to study the effects of varying the compactness of the neutron star. We consider neutron star compactness in the 0.123 to 0.2 range for binaries with mass ratios of 3 and 5. As the compactness and the mass ratio increase, the binary system behaves during the late inspiral and merger more like a black hole binary. For the case with the highest mass ratio and most compact neutron star, the gravitational waves emitted, in terms of mismatches, are almost indistinguishable from those by a binary black hole. The disruption of the star significantly suppresses the kicks on the final black hole. The disruption also affects, although not dramatically, the spin of the final black hole. Lastly, for neutron stars with low compactness, the quasi-normal ringing of the black hole after the merger does not show a clean quasi-normal ringing because of the late accretion of debris from the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Stellar population astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG: Measurement of the He I 10830{\AA} line in the open cluster Stock 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise measurement of stellar abundances plays a pivotal role in providing constraints on the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. However, before spectral lines can be employed as reliable abundance indicators, particularly for challenging elements such as helium, they must undergo thorough scrutiny. Galactic open clusters, representing well-defined single stellar populations, offer an ideal setting for unfolding the information stored in the helium spectral line feature. In this study, we characterize the profile and strength of the helium transition at around 10830{\AA} (He 10830) in nine giant stars in the Galactic open cluster Stock 2. To remove the influence of weak blending lines near the helium feature, we calibrated their oscillator strengths ($\log gf$) by employing corresponding abundances obtained from simultaneously observed optical spectra. Our observations reveal that He 10830 in all the targets is observed in absorption, with line strengths categorized into two groups. Three stars exhibit strong absorption, including a discernible secondary component, while the remaining stars exhibit weaker absorption. The lines are in symmetry and align with or around their rest wavelengths, suggesting a stable upper chromosphere without a significant systematic mass motion. We found a correlation between He 10830 strength and Ca II $\log{R'_\mathrm{HK}}$ index, with a slope similar to that reported in previous studies on dwarf stars. This correlation underscores the necessity of accounting for stellar chromosphere structure when employing He 10830 as a probe for stellar helium abundance. The procedure of measuring the He 10830 we developed in this study is applicable not only to other Galactic open clusters but also to field stars, with the aim of mapping helium abundance across various types of stars in the future.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Blueshift Interpretation In Light Of Recent Discovery Of Multiple Systems Of Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the anomalies associated with redshifts from emission lines in certain quasar candidates and the viability of a blueshift interpretation instead. The sample was taken from the Million Quasars Catalog (MILLIQUAS), representing the unidentified class with a redshift greater than 1. This sample was further constrained to those with spectra available, giving 208 candidates in total. This paper presents results on the sample, with the reported redshifts and the proposed blueshift interpretation. A subset of 38% of the sample was further analyzed using the best redshift interpretation of the emission lines from our analysis, which differed from the reported redshifts, in comparison with the blueshift interpretation. The number of unidentified lines under each interpretation was compared and was found to be statistically different with a P-value &lt; 0.05, with a larger number of unidentified lines under the redshift interpretation. The average spread values were also compared and found to be statistically different with a P-value &lt; 0.05, with blueshift having the smallest spread. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the analyzed sample, that is 183 quasar candidates, provided an overall better interpretation under the blueshift hypothesis, 9%, which is 19 candidates, had a better interpretation under the redshift hypothesis and 3%, which is 6 candidates, had no identifiable lines. This indicates the importance to consider this possibility as well in light of new discoveries such as the discovery of multiple quasar systems that can lead to ejections, which has implications for the dynamics of quasars and the line of sight.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Massive Black Hole Occupation Fraction Predicted in Cluster Dwarf Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occupation fraction of massive black holes (MBHs) in dwarf galaxies offers interesting insights into initial black hole seeding mechanisms and their mass assembly history, though disentangling these two effects remains challenging. Using the {\sc Romulus} cosmological simulations we examine the impact of environment on the occupation fraction of MBHs in low mass galaxies. Unlike most modern cosmological simulations, {\sc Romulus} seeds MBHs based on local gas properties, selecting dense ($n&gt;3$ cm$^{-3}$), pristine ($Z&lt;3e-4Z_{\odot}$), and rapidly collapsing regions in the early Universe as sites to host MBHs without assuming anything about MBH occupation as a function of galaxy stellar mass, or halo mass, {\it a priori}. The simulations predict that dwarf galaxies with M$_{\star}&lt;10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ in cluster environments are $\sim2$ times more likely to host a MBH compared to those in the field. The predicted occupation fractions are remarkably consistent with those of nuclear star clusters. Across cluster and field environments, dwarf galaxies with earlier formation times are more likely to host a MBH. While the MBH occupation function is similar between cluster and field environments at high redshift ($z&gt;3$), a difference arises as late-forming dwarfs -- which do not exist in the cluster environment -- begin to dominate in the field and pull the MBH occupation fraction down for low mass galaxies. Additionally, prior to in-fall some cluster dwarfs are similar to progenitors of massive, isolated galaxies, indicating that they might have grown to higher masses had they not been impeded by the cluster environment. While the population of MBHs in dwarf galaxies is already widely understood to be important for understanding MBH formation, this work demonstrates that environmental dependence is important to consider as future observations search for low mass black holes in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Quenching massive galaxies across cosmic time with the semi-analytic model SHARK v2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce version 2.0 of the SHARK semi-analytic model of galaxy formation after many improvements to the physics included. The most significant being: (i) a model describing the exchange of angular momentum (AM) between the interstellar medium and stars; (ii) a new active galactic nuclei feedback model which has two modes, a wind and a jet mode, with the jet mode tied to the jet energy production; (iii) a model tracking the development of black hole (BH) spins; (iv) more sophisticated modelling of environmental effects on satellite galaxies; and (v) automatic parameter exploration using Particle Swarm Optimisation. We focus on two timely research topics: the structural properties of galaxies and the quenching of massive galaxies. For the former, SHARK v2.0 is capable of producing a more realistic stellar size-mass relation with a plateau marking the transition from disk- to bulge-dominated galaxies, and scaling relations between specific AM and mass that agree well with observations. For the quenching of massive galaxies, SHARK v2.0 produces massive galaxies that are more quenched than the previous version, reproducing well the observed relations between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass, and specific SFR and BH mass at $z=0$. SHARK v2.0 produces a number density of massive-quiescent galaxies &gt;1dex higher than the previous version, in good agreement with JWST observations at $z\le 5$; predicts a stellar mass function of passive galaxies in reasonably good agreement with observations at $0.5&lt;z&lt;5$; and environmental quenching to already be effective at $z=5$.</description>

      <title>A Census of Photometrically Selected Little Red Dots at 4 &lt; z &lt; 9 in JWST Blank Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered numerous faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim5$ and beyond. These objects are key to our understanding of the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their co-evolution with host galaxies, as well as the role of AGN in cosmic reionization. Using photometric colors and size measurements, we perform a search for compact red objects in an array of blank deep JWST/NIRCam fields totaling $\sim640$ arcmin$^{2}$. Our careful selection yields 260 reddened AGN candidates at $4&lt;z_{\rm phot}&lt;9$, dominated by a point-source like central component ($\langle r_{\rm eff} \rangle &lt;130$ pc) and displaying a dichotomy in their rest-frame colors (blue UV and red optical slopes). Quasar model fitting reveals our objects to be moderately dust extincted ($A_{\rm V}\sim1.6$), which is reflected in their inferred bolometric luminosities of $L_{\rm bol}$ = 10$^{44-47}$ erg/s, and fainter UV magnitudes $M_{\rm UV} \simeq$ $-17$ to $-22$. Thanks to the large areas explored, we extend the existing dusty AGN luminosity functions to both fainter and brighter magnitudes, estimating their number densities to be $\times100$ higher than for UV-selected quasars of similar magnitudes. At the same time they constitute only a small fraction of all UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts, but this percentage rises to $\sim$10\% for $M_{UV}\sim -22$ at $z\sim7$. Finally, assuming a conservative case of accretion at the Eddington rate, we place a lower limit on the SMBH mass function at $z\sim5$, finding it to be consistent with both theory and previous JWST observations.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Group Merger Origin of the Cloverleaf Odd Radio Circle System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd radio circles (ORCs) are a newly discovered class of extended faint radio sources of unknown origin. We report the first detection of diffuse X-ray gas at the location of a low-redshift ORC (z=0.046) known as Cloverleaf ORC. This observation was performed with the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. The physical extent of the diffuse X-ray emission corresponds to a region of approximately 230 kpc by 160 kpc, lying perpendicular to the radio emission detected by ASKAP. The X-ray spectrum shows characteristics of thermal multiphase gas with temperatures of 1.10+/-0.08 keV and 0.22+/-0.01 keV and a central density of $(4.9\pm0.6)\times10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating that the Cloverleaf ORC resides in a low-mass galaxy group. Using X-ray observations, with hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermal assumptions, we measure the galaxy group to have a gas mass and a total mass of $(7.7\pm 0.8) \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\rm sun}$ and $2.6\pm0.3\times10^{13}$~$M_{\rm sun}$ within the overdensity radius R$_{500}$. The presence of a high-velocity subgroup identified in optical data, the orientation of the brightest cluster galaxy, the disturbed morphologies of galaxies toward the east of the Cloverleaf ORC, and the irregular morphology of the X-ray emission suggest that this system is undergoing a galaxy group merger. The radio power of the ORC could be explained by the shock reacceleration of fossil cosmic rays generated by a previous episode of black hole activity in the central active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>Galaxy merger challenge: A comparison study between machine learning-based detection methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various galaxy merger detection methods have been applied to diverse datasets. However, it is difficult to understand how they compare. We aim to benchmark the relative performance of machine learning (ML) merger detection methods. We explore six leading ML methods using three main datasets. The first one (the training data) consists of mock observations from the IllustrisTNG simulations and allows us to quantify the performance metrics of the detection methods. The second one consists of mock observations from the Horizon-AGN simulations, introduced to evaluate the performance of classifiers trained on different, but comparable data. The third one consists of real observations from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. For the binary classification task (mergers vs. non-mergers), all methods perform reasonably well in the domain of the training data. At $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3$, precision and recall range between $\sim$70\% and 80\%, both of which decrease with increasing $z$ as expected (by $\sim$5\% for precision and $\sim$10\% for recall at $0.76&lt;z&lt;1.0$). When transferred to a different domain, the precision of all classifiers is only slightly reduced, but the recall is significantly worse (by $\sim$20-40\% depending on the method). Zoobot offers the best overall performance in terms of precision and F1 score. When applied to real HSC observations, all methods agree well with visual labels of clear mergers but can differ by more than an order of magnitude in predicting the overall fraction of major mergers. For the multi-class classification task to distinguish pre-, post- and non-mergers, none of the methods offer a good performance, which could be partly due to limitations in resolution and depth of the data. With the advent of better quality data (e.g. JWST and Euclid), it is important to improve our ability to detect mergers and distinguish between merger stages.</description>

      <title>The APO-K2 Catalog. II. Accurate Stellar Ages for Red Giant Branch Stars across the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present stellar age determinations for 4661 red giant branch stars in the APO-K2 catalog, derived using mass estimates from K2 asteroseismology from the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program and elemental abundances from the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment survey. Our sample includes 17 of the 19 fields observed by K2, making it one of the most comprehensive catalogs of accurate stellar ages across the Galaxy in terms of the wide range of populations spanned by its stars, enabling rigorous tests of Galactic chemical evolution models. Taking into account the selection functions of the K2 sample, the data appear to support the age-chemistry morphology of stellar populations predicted by both inside-out and late-burst scenarios. We also investigate trends in age versus stellar chemistry and Galactic position, which are consistent with previous findings. Comparisons against APOKASC-3 asteroseismic ages show agreement to within ~3%. We also discuss offsets between our ages and spectroscopic ages. Finally, we note that ignoring the effects of $\alpha$-enhancement on stellar opacity (either directly or with the Salaris metallicity correction) results in an ~10% offset in age estimates for the most $\alpha$-enhanced stars, which is an important consideration for continued tests of Galactic models with this and other asteroseismic age samples.</description>

      <title>The Physical Origin of the Stellar Initial Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars are amongst the most fundamental structures of our Universe. They comprise most of the baryonic and luminous mass of galaxies, synthethise heavy elements, and injec\ t mass, momentum, and energy into the interstellar medium. They are also home to the planets. Since stellar properties are primarily decided by their mass, the so-called \ stellar initial mass function (IMF) is critical to the structuring of our Universe. We review the various physical processes, and theories which have been put forward as well as the numerical simulations which have been carried out to explain the origin of the stellar initial mass function. Key messages from this review are: (1) Gravity and turbulence most likely determine the power-law, high-mass part of the IMF. (2) Depending of the Mach number and the density distribution, several regimes are possible, including $\Gamma _{IMF} \simeq 0$, -0.8, -1 or -1.3 where $d N / d \log M \propto M^{\Gamma_{IMF}}$. These regimes are likely universal, however the transition between these regimes is not. (3) Protostellar jets can play a regulating influence on the IMF by injecting momentum into collapsing clumps and unbinding gas. (4) The peak of the IMF may be a consequence of dust opacity and molecular hydrogen physics at the origin of the first hydrostatic core. This depends weakly on large scale environmental conditions such as radiation, magnetic field, turbulence or metallicity. This likely constitutes one of the reason of the relative universality of the IMF.</description>

      <title>Addition of the Local Volume sample of galaxies from the FAST HI survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {We report the discovery of 20 new dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume identified as optical counterparts to the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) All Sky HI Survey (FASHI) sources. The galaxies have a median stellar mass of $7.8\times 10^6~M_{\odot}$ and a median HI mass of $1.0\times 10^7~M_{\odot}$. Most of them are field galaxies, while three are probable members of the M 101 and M 106 groups. We also found seven FASHI radio sources to be probable dark HI clouds in nearby groups. Together with four other known HI clouds in the local groups, their mean-square radial velocity difference of 49~km~s$^{-1}$ with respect to the host galaxies yields an average total mass of ($2.7\pm1.0)\times10^{11}~M_{\odot}$ for these groups on the projected scale of 90 kpc.</description>

      <title>Dust Formation in Common Envelope Binary Interaction -- I: 3D Simulations Using the Bowen Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carried out 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of the common envelope binary interaction using the approximation of Bowen to calculate the dust opacity in order to investigate the resulting dust-driven accelerations. We have simulated two types of binary star: a 1.7 and a 3.7 $M_{\odot}$ thermally-pulsating, asymptotic giant branch stars with a 0.6 $M_{\odot}$ companion. We carried out simulations using both an ideal gas and a tabulated equations of state, with the latter considering the recombination energy of the envelope. We found that the dust-driven wind leads to a relatively small increase in the unbound gas, with the effect being smaller for the tabulated equation of state simulations and for the more massive primary. Dust acceleration does contribute to envelope expansion with only a slightly elongated morphology, if we believe the results from the tabulated equation of state as more reliable. The Bowen opacities in the outer envelopes of the two models, at late times, are large enough that the photosphere of the post-inspiral object is about ten times larger compared to the same without accounting for the dust opacities. As such, the prediction of the appearance of the transient would change substantially if dust is included.</description>

      <title>Interior solution of azimuthally symmetric case of Laplace equation in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvilinear coordinate systems distinct from the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system are particularly valuable in the field calculations as they facilitate the expression of boundary conditions of differential equations in a reasonably simple way when the coordinate surfaces fit the physical boundaries of the problem. The recently finalized orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. Such shape is aproximating well objects investigated within astrophysics. The solution of the azimuthally symmetric case of the Laplace equation was found for the interior space in the orthogonal SOS coordinates. In the frame of the derivation of the harmonic functions, the Laplace equation was separated by a special separation procedure. A generalized Legendre equation was introduced as the equation for the angular part of the separated Laplace equation. The harmonic functions were determined as relations involving generalized Legendre functions of the first and of the second kind. Several lower-degree functions are reported. Recursion formula facilitating determination of the higher-degree harmonic functions was found. The general solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation for the interior space in the SOS coordinates is reported.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>
