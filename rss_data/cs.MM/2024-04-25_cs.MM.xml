      <title>Simple but Effective Raw-Data Level Multimodal Fusion for Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve the target image based on a multimodal query, i.e., a reference image paired with corresponding modification text. Recent CIR studies leverage vision-language pre-trained (VLP) methods as the feature extraction backbone, and perform nonlinear feature-level multimodal query fusion to retrieve the target image. Despite the promising performance, we argue that their nonlinear feature-level multimodal fusion may lead to the fused feature deviating from the original embedding space, potentially hurting the retrieval performance. To address this issue, in this work, we propose shifting the multimodal fusion from the feature level to the raw-data level to fully exploit the VLP model's multimodal encoding and cross-modal alignment abilities. In particular, we introduce a Dual Query Unification-based Composed Image Retrieval framework (DQU-CIR), whose backbone simply involves a VLP model's image encoder and a text encoder. Specifically, DQU-CIR first employs two training-free query unification components: text-oriented query unification and vision-oriented query unification, to derive a unified textual and visual query based on the raw data of the multimodal query, respectively. The unified textual query is derived by concatenating the modification text with the extracted reference image's textual description, while the unified visual query is created by writing the key modification words onto the reference image. Ultimately, to address diverse search intentions, DQU-CIR linearly combines the features of the two unified queries encoded by the VLP model to retrieve the target image. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Multimodal Wearable Sensor-based Human Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of increased life expectancy and falling birth rates is resulting in an aging population. Wearable Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (WSHAR) emerges as a promising assistive technology to support the daily lives of older individuals, unlocking vast potential for human-centric applications. However, recent surveys in WSHAR have been limited, focusing either solely on deep learning approaches or on a single sensor modality. In real life, our human interact with the world in a multi-sensory way, where diverse information sources are intricately processed and interpreted to accomplish a complex and unified sensing system. To give machines similar intelligence, multimodal machine learning, which merges data from various sources, has become a popular research area with recent advancements. In this study, we present a comprehensive survey from a novel perspective on how to leverage multimodal learning to WSHAR domain for newcomers and researchers. We begin by presenting the recent sensor modalities as well as deep learning approaches in HAR. Subsequently, we explore the techniques used in present multimodal systems for WSHAR. This includes inter-multimodal systems which utilize sensor modalities from both visual and non-visual systems and intra-multimodal systems that simply take modalities from non-visual systems. After that, we focus on current multimodal learning approaches that have applied to solve some of the challenges existing in WSHAR. Specifically, we make extra efforts by connecting the existing multimodal literature from other domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing, with current WSHAR area. Finally, we identify the corresponding challenges and potential research direction in current WSHAR area for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Wiki-LLaVA: Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are the natural evolution of LLMs, and enlarge their capabilities so as to work beyond the pure textual modality. As research is being carried out to design novel architectures and vision-and-language adapters, in this paper we concentrate on endowing such models with the capability of answering questions that require external knowledge. Our approach, termed Wiki-LLaVA, aims at integrating an external knowledge source of multimodal documents, which is accessed through a hierarchical retrieval pipeline. Relevant passages, using this approach, are retrieved from the external knowledge source and employed as additional context for the LLM, augmenting the effectiveness and precision of generated dialogues. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets tailored for visual question answering with external data and demonstrate the appropriateness of our approach.</description>

      <title>HybridVC: Efficient Voice Style Conversion with Text and Audio Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce HybridVC, a voice conversion (VC) framework built upon a pre-trained conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that combines the strengths of a latent model with contrastive learning. HybridVC supports text and audio prompts, enabling more flexible voice style conversion. HybridVC models a latent distribution conditioned on speaker embeddings acquired by a pretrained speaker encoder and optimises style text embeddings to align with the speaker style information through contrastive learning in parallel. Therefore, HybridVC can be efficiently trained under limited computational resources. Our experiments demonstrate HybridVC's superior training efficiency and its capability for advanced multi-modal voice style conversion. This underscores its potential for widespread applications such as user-defined personalised voice in various social media platforms. A comprehensive ablation study further validates the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>DVF: Advancing Robust and Accurate Fine-Grained Image Retrieval with Retrieval Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) is to learn visual representations that distinguish visually similar objects while maintaining generalization. Existing methods propose to generate discriminative features, but rarely consider the particularity of the FGIR task itself. This paper presents a meticulous analysis leading to the proposal of practical guidelines to identify subcategory-specific discrepancies and generate discriminative features to design effective FGIR models. These guidelines include emphasizing the object (G1), highlighting subcategory-specific discrepancies (G2), and employing effective training strategy (G3). Following G1 and G2, we design a novel Dual Visual Filtering mechanism for the plain visual transformer, denoted as DVF, to capture subcategory-specific discrepancies. Specifically, the dual visual filtering mechanism comprises an object-oriented module and a semantic-oriented module. These components serve to magnify objects and identify discriminative regions, respectively. Following G3, we implement a discriminative model training strategy to improve the discriminability and generalization ability of DVF. Extensive analysis and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our proposed guidelines. Without bells and whistles, the proposed DVF achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used fine-grained datasets in closed-set and open-set settings.</description>

      <title>GaussianTalker: Real-Time High-Fidelity Talking Head Synthesis with Audio-Driven 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose GaussianTalker, a novel framework for real-time generation of pose-controllable talking heads. It leverages the fast rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) while addressing the challenges of directly controlling 3DGS with speech audio. GaussianTalker constructs a canonical 3DGS representation of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. A key insight is to encode the 3D Gaussian attributes into a shared implicit feature representation, where it is merged with audio features to manipulate each Gaussian attribute. This design exploits the spatial-aware features and enforces interactions between neighboring points. The feature embeddings are then fed to a spatial-audio attention module, which predicts frame-wise offsets for the attributes of each Gaussian. It is more stable than previous concatenation or multiplication approaches for manipulating the numerous Gaussians and their intricate parameters. Experimental results showcase GaussianTalker's superiority in facial fidelity, lip synchronization accuracy, and rendering speed compared to previous methods. Specifically, GaussianTalker achieves a remarkable rendering speed of 120 FPS, surpassing previous benchmarks.

      <title>Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15401v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is an active research topic in artificial intelligence. Its main goal is to integrate multi-modalities to identify human emotional states. Current works generally assume accurate emotion labels for benchmark datasets and focus on developing more effective architectures. However, emotions have inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. To obtain more reliable labels, existing datasets usually restrict the label space to some basic categories, then hire multiple annotators and use majority voting to select the most likely label. However, this process may cause some correct but non-candidate or non-majority labels to be ignored. To improve reliability without ignoring subtle emotions, we propose a new task called "Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (EMER)". In contrast to traditional tasks that focus on predicting emotions, EMER takes a step further by providing explanations for these predictions. Through this task, we can extract more reliable labels since each label has a certain basis. Meanwhile, we use LLMs to disambiguate unimodal descriptions and generate more complete multimodal EMER descriptions. From them, we can extract more subtle labels, providing a promising approach for open-vocabulary emotion recognition. This paper presents our initial efforts, where we introduce a new dataset, establish baselines, and define evaluation metrics. In addition, EMER can also be used as a benchmark dataset to evaluate the audio-video-text understanding capabilities of multimodal LLMs. To facilitate further research, we will make the code and data available at: https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/AffectGPT.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Character Identification and Speaker Prediction in Comics via Iterative Multimodal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing characters and predicting speakers of dialogue are critical for comic processing tasks, such as voice generation or translation. However, because characters vary by comic title, supervised learning approaches like training character classifiers which require specific annotations for each comic title are infeasible. This motivates us to propose a novel zero-shot approach, allowing machines to identify characters and predict speaker names based solely on unannotated comic images. In spite of their importance in real-world applications, these task have largely remained unexplored due to challenges in story comprehension and multimodal integration. Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown great capability for text understanding and reasoning, while their application to multimodal content analysis is still an open problem. To address this problem, we propose an iterative multimodal framework, the first to employ multimodal information for both character identification and speaker prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, establishing a robust baseline for these tasks. Furthermore, since our method requires no training data or annotations, it can be used as-is on any comic series.</description>

      <title>EdgeVision: Towards Collaborative Video Analytics on Distributed Edges for Performance Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based video analytics significantly improves recognition accuracy in computer vision applications. Deploying DNN models at edge nodes, closer to end users, reduces inference delay and minimizes bandwidth costs. However, these resource-constrained edge nodes may experience substantial delays under heavy workloads, leading to imbalanced workload distribution. While previous efforts focused on optimizing hierarchical device-edge-cloud architectures or centralized clusters for video analytics, we propose addressing these challenges through collaborative distributed and autonomous edge nodes. Despite the intricate control involved, we introduce EdgeVision, a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)- based framework for collaborative video analytics on distributed edges. EdgeVision enables edge nodes to autonomously learn policies for video preprocessing, model selection, and request dispatching. Our approach utilizes an actor-critic-based MARL algorithm enhanced with an attention mechanism to learn optimal policies. To validate EdgeVision, we construct a multi-edge testbed and conduct experiments with real-world datasets. Results demonstrate a performance enhancement of 33.6% to 86.4% compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>NU-Class Net: A Novel Deep Learning-based Approach for Video Quality Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video content has experienced a surge in popularity, asserting its dominance over internet traffic and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Video compression has long been regarded as the primary means of efficiently managing the substantial multimedia traffic generated by video-capturing devices. Nevertheless, video compression algorithms entail significant computational demands in order to achieve substantial compression ratios. This complexity presents a formidable challenge when implementing efficient video coding standards in resource-constrained embedded systems, such as IoT edge node cameras. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces NU-Class Net, an innovative deep-learning model designed to mitigate compression artifacts stemming from lossy compression codecs. This enhancement significantly elevates the perceptible quality of low-bit-rate videos. By employing the NU-Class Net, the video encoder within the video-capturing node can reduce output quality, thereby generating low-bit-rate videos and effectively curtailing both computation and bandwidth requirements at the edge. On the decoder side, which is typically less encumbered by resource limitations, NU-Class Net is applied after the video decoder to compensate for artifacts and approximate the quality of the original video. Experimental results affirm the efficacy of the proposed model in enhancing the perceptible quality of videos, especially those streamed at low bit rates.</description>

      <title>MuChin: A Chinese Colloquial Description Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in the Field of Music</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapidly evolving multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) urgently require new benchmarks to uniformly evaluate their performance on understanding and textually describing music. However, due to semantic gaps between Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms and human understanding, discrepancies between professionals and the public, and low precision of annotations, existing music description datasets cannot serve as benchmarks. To this end, we present MuChin, the first open-source music description benchmark in Chinese colloquial language, designed to evaluate the performance of multimodal LLMs in understanding and describing music. We established the Caichong Music Annotation Platform (CaiMAP) that employs an innovative multi-person, multi-stage assurance method, and recruited both amateurs and professionals to ensure the precision of annotations and alignment with popular semantics. Utilizing this method, we built a dataset with multi-dimensional, high-precision music annotations, the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD), and carefully selected 1,000 high-quality entries to serve as the test set for MuChin. Based on MuChin, we analyzed the discrepancies between professionals and amateurs in terms of music description, and empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of annotated data for fine-tuning LLMs. Ultimately, we employed MuChin to evaluate existing music understanding models on their ability to provide colloquial descriptions of music. All data related to the benchmark, along with the scoring code and detailed appendices, have been open-sourced (https://github.com/CarlWangChina/MuChin/).</description>

      <title>Seeing Text in the Dark: Algorithm and Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localizing text in low-light environments is challenging due to visual degradations. Although a straightforward solution involves a two-stage pipeline with low-light image enhancement (LLE) as the initial step followed by detector, LLE is primarily designed for human vision instead of machine and can accumulate errors. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective single-stage approach for localizing text in dark that circumvents the need for LLE. We introduce a constrained learning module as an auxiliary mechanism during the training stage of the text detector. This module is designed to guide the text detector in preserving textual spatial features amidst feature map resizing, thus minimizing the loss of spatial information in texts under low-light visual degradations. Specifically, we incorporate spatial reconstruction and spatial semantic constraints within this module to ensure the text detector acquires essential positional and contextual range knowledge. Our approach enhances the original text detector's ability to identify text's local topological features using a dynamic snake feature pyramid network and adopts a bottom-up contour shaping strategy with a novel rectangular accumulation technique for accurate delineation of streamlined text features. In addition, we present a comprehensive low-light dataset for arbitrary-shaped text, encompassing diverse scenes and languages. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this low-light dataset and exhibits comparable performance on standard normal light datasets. The code and dataset will be released.</description>
