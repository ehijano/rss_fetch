      <title>Wakimoto construction for double loop algebras and $\zeta$-function regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feigin-Frenkel homomorphism underpinning the Wakimoto construction realises an affine Lie algebra at critical level in terms of the $\beta\gamma$-system of free fields. It was recently shown that much of the construction also goes through for double loop algebras. However, certain divergent sums appear. In this paper, we show that, suggestively, these sums vanish when one performs $\zeta$-function regularisation.</description>

      <title>On induced L-infinity action of diffeomorphisms on Cochains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the approaches to quantum gravity is to formulate it in terms of De Rham algebra, choose a triangulation of space-time, and replace differential forms by cochains (that form a finite dimensional vector space). The key issue of general relativity is the action of diffeomorphisms of space-time on fields.
  In this paper, we induce the action of diffeomorphisms on cochains by homotopy transfer (or, equivalently, BV integral) that leads to a $L_{\infty}$ action.
  We explicitly compute this action for the space-time being an interval, a circle, and a square.</description>

      <title>Spectral Determinants of Almost Equilateral Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kirchoff's matrix tree theorem of 1847 connects the number of spanning trees of a graph to the spectral determinant of the discrete Laplacian [6]. Recently an analogue was obtained for quantum graphs relating the number of spanning trees to the spectral determinant of a Laplacian acting on functions on a metric graph with standard (Neumann-like) vertex conditions [11]. This result holds for quantum graphs where the edge lengths are close together. A quantum graph where the edge lengths are all equal is called equilateral. Here we consider equilateral graphs where we perturb the length of a single edge (almost equilateral graphs). We analyze the spectral determinant of almost equilateral complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and circulant graphs. This provides a measure of how fast the spectral determinant changes with respect to changes in an edge length. We apply these results to estimate the width of a window of edge lengths where the connection between the number of spanning trees and the spectral determinant can be observed. The results suggest the connection holds for a much wider window of edge lengths than is required in [11].</description>

Abstract: In this paper, by studying a class of 1-D Sturm-Liouville problems with periodic coefficients, we show and classify the solutions of periodic Schrodinger equations in a multidimensional case, which tells that not all the solutions are Bloch solutions. In addition, we also provide several properties of the solutions and quasimomenta and illustrate the relationship between bounded solutions and Bloch solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative topological strings from resurgence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The partition function of topological string theory on any family of Calabi-Yau threefolds is defined perturbatively as an asymptotic series in the topological string coupling and encodes, in a holomorphic limit, higher genus Gromov-Witten as well as Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. We prove that the partition function of topological strings of any CY in this limit can be written as a product, where each factor is given by the partition function of the resolved conifold with shifted arguments, raised to the power of certain sheaf invariants. We use this result to put forward an expression for the non-perturbative topological string partition function in this limit, as a product over analytic functions in the topological string coupling which correspond to the Borel sums for the resolved conifold found previously. The non-perturbative corrections to the partition function are identified with Stokes jumps of a Borel summation. They depend only on genus zero GV invariants and can be expressed entirely in terms of a single function which is introduced as a deformation of the prepotential.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classes of classical stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic symmetry classification of the Markov generators of classical stochastic processes. Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Gauge Freedom and Objective Rates in the Morphodynamics of Fluid Deformable Surfaces: the Jaumann Rate vs. the Material Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morphodynamic descriptions of fluid deformable surfaces are relevant for a range of biological and soft matter phenomena, spanning materials that can be passive or active, as well as ordered or topological. However, a principled, geometric formulation of the correct hydrodynamic equations has remained opaque, with objective rates proving a central, contentious issue. We argue that this is due to a conflation of several important notions that must be disambiguated when describing fluid deformable surfaces. These are the Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives on fluid motion, and three different types of gauge freedom: in the ambient space; in the parameterisation of the surface, and; in the choice of frame field on the surface. We clarify these ideas, and show that objective rates in fluid deformable surfaces are time derivatives that are invariant under the first of these gauge freedoms, and which also preserve the structure of the ambient metric. The latter condition reduces a potentially infinite number of possible objective rates to only two: the material derivative and the Jaumann rate. The material derivative is invariant under the Galilean group, and therefore applies to velocities, whose rate captures the conservation of momentum. The Jaumann derivative is invariant under all time-dependent isometries, and therefore applies to local order parameters, or symmetry-broken variables, such as the nematic $Q$-tensor. We provide examples of material and Jaumann rates in two different frame fields that are pertinent to the current applications of the fluid mechanics of deformable surfaces.</description>

      <title>Towards full instanton trans-series in Hofstadter's butterfly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trans-series completion of perturbative series of a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be determined by combining the resurgence program and extra input coming from exact WKB analysis. In this paper, we reexamine the Harper-Hofstadter model and its spectrum, Hofstadter's butterfly, in light of recent developments. We demonstrate the connection between the perturbative energy series of the Harper-Hofstadter model and the vev of $1/2$-BPS Wilson loop of 5d SYM and clarify the differences between their non-perturbative corrections. Taking insights from the cosine potential model, we construct the full energy trans-series for flux $\phi=2\pi/Q$ and provide numerical evidence with remarkably high precision. Finally, we revisit the problem of self-similarity of the butterfly and discuss the possibility of a completed version of the Rammal-Wilkinson formula.</description>

      <title>Cauchy matrix approach to novel extended semi-discrete KP-type systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two novel extended semi-discrete KP-type systems, namely partial differential-difference systems with one continuous and two discrete variables, are investigated. Introducing an arbitrary function into the Cauchy matrix function or the plane wave factor allows the implementation of extended integrable systems within the Cauchy matrix approach. We introduce the bilinear D\delta2KP system, the extended D\delta2pKP, D\delta2pmKP, and D\delta2SKP systems, all of which are based on the Cauchy matrix approach. This results in a diversity of solutions for these extended systems as contrasted to the usual multiple soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Stokes' paradox in rarefied gases: A perspective through the method of fundamental solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of fluid dynamics, a curious and counterintuitive phenomenon is Stokes' paradox. While Stokes equations -- used for modeling slow and steady flows -- lead to a meaningful solution to the problem of slow and steady flow past a sphere, they fail to yield a non-trivial solution to the problem of slow and steady flow past an infinitely long cylinder (a two-dimensional problem essentially); this is referred to as Stokes' paradox. We revisit this paradox in the context of rarefied gas flows by means of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS). To this end, we adopt an extended hydrodynamic model, referred to as the CCR model, consisting of the balance equations for the mass, momentum and energy and closed with the coupled constitutive relations. We determine an analytic solution of the CCR model for the problem and compare it with the MFS-based numerical solution. Apart from addressing flow past a circular cylinder, we aim to showcase the capability of the MFS to predict the flow past other objects in two dimensions for which the analytic solutions do not exist. For that, we investigate the problem of rarefied gas flow past an infinitely long semicircular cylinder.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear evolution of disturbances in higher time-derivative theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of localized initial value profiles when propagated in integrable versions of higher time-derivative theories. In contrast to the standard cases in nonlinear integrable systems, where these profiles evolve into a specific number of N-soliton solutions as dictated by the conservation laws, in the higher time derivative theories the theoretical prediction is that the initial profiles can settle into either two-soliton solutions or into any number of N-soliton solutions. In the latter case this implies that the solutions exhibit oscillations that spread in time but remain finite. We confirm these analytical predictions by explicitly solving the associated Cauchy problem numerically with multiple initial profiles for various higher time-derivative versions of integrable modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. In the case with the theoretical possibility of a decay into two-soliton solutions, the emergence of underlying singularities may prevent the profiles from fully developing or may be accompanied by oscillatory, chargeless standing waves at the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that BPS-impurity theories may support BPS kink-kink solutions i.e., an energetically degenerated family of solutions describing two kinks at any mutual distance. This requires a singular impurity. As an example we consider the sine-Gordon and $\phi^6$ models coupled with such a BPS impurity. Interestingly, obtained solutions are identical to double sine-Gordon kinks and Christ-Lee kinks respectively.
  We also study the spectral flow on the moduli space. All the modes have an odd number of nodes to cancel the singularity of the impurity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analogue of the Chern-Pontryagin density for $SO(D)$ gauged $O(D+1)$ Skyrme systems, referred to as Skyrme--Chern-Pontyagin (SCP) densities iss known for dimensions $D=2,3,4$. Since these are defined only through a prescription, it is necessary to extend the realisation to higher $D$, which is carried out here for $D=5$. It is found that in $D=5$ there is limitation on the group gauging the Skyrmion, implying that such limitation will persist in higher dimensions. The construction of SCP densities in $D=2,3,4,5$ is presented here in a unified notation with the aim of of pointing out to possible extarpolation to all dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of classical $p$-adic integrable system on a $p$-adic symplectic manifold was proposed by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author a decade ago in analogy with the real case. In the present paper we introduce and study, from the viewpoint of symplectic geometry and topology, the basic properties of the $p$-adic version of the classical Jaynes-Cummings model. The Jaynes-Cummings model is a fundamental example of integrable system going back to the work of Jaynes and Cummings in the 1960s, and which applies to many physical situations, for instance in quantum optics and quantum information theory. Several of our results depend on the value of $p$: the structure of the model depends on the class of the prime $p$ modulo $4$ and $p=2$ requires special treatment.</description>

      <title>Solution of some tiling open problems of Propp, Lai, and some related results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai, to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, and to exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there is a unique Levi-Civita connection on the one-forms of the Dabrowski-Sitarz spectral triple for the Podle\'{s} sphere $S^{2}_{q}$. We compute the full curvature tensor, as well as the Ricci and scalar curvature of the Podle\'{s} sphere using the framework of \cite{MRLC}. The scalar curvature is a constant, and as the parameter $q\to 1$, the scalar curvature converges to the classical value $2$. We prove a generalised Weitzenbock formula for the spinor bundle, which differs from the classical Lichnerowicz formula for $q\neq 1$, yet recovers it for $q\to 1$.</description>

Abstract: For the class of $1+1$ dimensional field theories referred to as the non-linear sigma models, there is known to be a deep connection between classical integrability and one-loop renormalizability. In this work, the phenomenon is reviewed on the example of the so-called fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ Principal Chiral Field (PCF). Along the way, we discover a new classically integrable four parameter family of sigma models, which is obtained from the fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ PCF by means of the Poisson-Lie deformation. The theory turns out to be one-loop renormalizable and the system of ODEs describing the flow of the four couplings is derived. Also provided are explicit analytical expressions for the full set of functionally independent first integrals (renormalization group invariants).</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on an arbitrary 3-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary as an invariant probability measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. Proving the nontriviality and the covariance under Riemannian isometries of that measure gives for the first time a non-perturbative, non-topological interacting Euclidean quantum field theory on curved spaces in dimension 3. This answers a longstanding open problem of constructive quantum field theory on curved 3 dimensional backgrounds. To control analytically several Feynman diagrams appearing in the construction of a number of random fields, we introduce a novel approach of renormalization using microlocal and harmonic analysis. This allows to obtain a renormalized equation which involves some universal constants independent of the manifold. We also define a new vectorial Cole-Hopf transform which allows to deal with the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model where $\Phi$ is now a bundle valued random field. In a companion paper, we develop in a self-contained way all the tools from paradifferential and microlocal analysis that we use to build in our manifold setting a number of analytic and probabilistic objects.</description>

      <title>Elastic bounds of the coupling tensor of anisotropic composite laminates: a polar approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the equivalent single layer theories of anisotropic laminates, the coupling tensor B describes the relation between the in- and out-of plane behavior of the plate. This tensor has some peculiar characteristics and in particular it is not defined, so it is normally considered as an unbounded tensor. We show in this paper a way to determine some relations between the polar invariants of B and those of the tensors describing the in- and out-of- plane behaviors of the laminate, A and D respectively. These relations constitute a set of bounds for the invariants of all the tensors of the laminate, A,B and D. It is hence shown that also the components of B must satisfy some conditions. Some peculiar cases, interesting for applications, are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random XXZ quantum spin chain manifests localization (in the form of quasi-locality) in any fixed energy interval, as previously proved by the authors. In this article it is shown that this property implies slow propagation of information, one of the putative signatures of many-body localization, in the same energy interval.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture by H. Dullin and R. Montgomery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the planar Euler problem in the quasi--periodic regime, the formulae of the periods available in the literature are simple only on one side of their singularity. In this paper, we complement such formulae with others, which result simpler on the other side. The derivation of such new formulae uses the Keplerian limit and complex analysis tools.
  As an application, we prove a conjecture by H. Dullin and R. Montgomery, which states that such periods, as well as their ratio, the {\it rotation number}, are monotone functions of their non--trivial first integral, at any fixed energy level.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermion induced power-law scaling in the violation of Wiedemann-Franz law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>

Abstract: For a family of self-adjoint Dirac operators $-i c (\alpha \cdot \nabla) + \frac{c^2}{2}$ subject to generalized MIT bag boundary conditions on domains in $\mathbb R^3$ it is shown that the nonrelativistic limit in the norm resolvent sense is the Dirichlet Laplacian. This allows to transfer spectral geometry results for Dirichlet Laplacians to Dirac operators for large $c$.</description>

      <title>Topologies of maximally extended non-Hausdorff Misner Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misner (1967) space is a portion of 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, identified under a boost $\mathcal B$. It is well known that the maximal analytic extension of Misner space that is Hausdorff consists of one half of Minkowski spacetime, identified under $\mathcal B$; and Hawking and Ellis (1973) have shown that the maximal analytic extension that is non-Hausdorff is equal to the full Minkowski spacetime with the point $Q$ at the origin removed, identifed under $\mathcal B$. In this paper I show that, in fact, there is an infinite set of non-Hausdorff maximal analytic extensions, each with a different causal structure. The extension constructed by Hawking and Ellis is the simplest of these. Another extension is obtained by wrapping an infinite number of copies of Minkowski spacetime around the removed $Q$ as a helicoid or Riemann surface and then identifying events under the boost $\mathcal B$. The other extensions are obtained by wrapping some number $n$ of successive copies of Minkowski spacetime around the missing $Q$ as a helicoid, then identifying the end of the $n$'th copy with the beginning of the initial copy, and then identifying events under $\mathcal B$. I discuss the causal structure and covering spaces of each of these extensions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any differentiable scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result--a time-integrated generalized speed limit--reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g.\ in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Conformable Derivative Approach to Granular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proper modeling of complex systems requires innovative mathematical tools. In this sense, we sought to use deformed or fractal derivatives for studying the dynamics of systems, particularly those, such as granular gases, in which the description of the dynamics can be done by using the stretched exponential probability densities. In this contribution we draw up three results of this application of mathematical tools. The first result shows that when we use constraints with finite momentum and the principle of maximum entropy, the Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts function, known as stretched exponential, emerges naturally and in a simpler way, when compared to results in the literature. Next, we obtain generalized expressions for the Langevin equation, as well as its solutions for three different deformed derivatives, including those connected with nonaddictive statistical mechanics. The Haff's-like law for granular gases are obtained. Next, we calculate the partition function $Z$ for a granular gas system by building up the probability density in terms of the stretched exponential function. From this partition function, we determine the internal energy of the system as well as the specific heat, both dependent on temperature. The consistency with classical approach of kinetic theory for ideal gases was verified.</description>

      <title>One-particle irreducibility of Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective action formalism introduced by Vilkovisky and later modified by DeWitt is completely covariant suitable for obtaining an effective action that is independent of the parametrization of the quantum fields. Among a few basic properties of an effective action, one property is that it can be written as a sum of one-particle irreducible diagrams. In this work, we verify this property up to three-loop order for Vilkovisky-Dewitt effective action (VDEA) by solving the equations satisfied by VDEA written down in the original parametrization for non-gauge theories.</description>
