      <title>Local Properties of the Rapidity Distribution in the Lieb-Liniger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.</description>

      <title>The controlled rotation of entanglement in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism became very popular because of unique features, namely coupling between magnetic properties and momentum of itinerant electrons. The particular model of the altermagnetic system of our interest has already been studied in recent publications in a different context: Phys. Rev. B \textbf{108}, L140408 (2023). Here, we study the scattering process of an itinerant electron from the altermagnetic system on the electron localized in a quantum dot. We found a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of quantum entanglement in the post-scattering state. An interesting observation is the controlled rotation of entanglement achieved by means of spin-orbital coupling constant in altermagnetic. We also studied Reny entropy and the effect of disorder in the system leading to randomness in the spin-orbit constant. Our main finding is that due to the unique properties of an altermagnetic system, tuning the applied external magnetic field allows tailoring of the desired entangled state. Thus, the scattering process, in essence, mimics the Hadamard-CNOT Gate transformation, converting the initial disentangled state into the entangled state of Bell's state. In particular, we achieved more than 70 percent fidelity between the post-scattering and Bell's states.</description>

      <title>Dissipation enables robust extensive scaling of multipartite correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multipartite mutual information between $N$ discrete-state stochastic units interacting in a networks that is invariant under unit permutations. We show that when the system relaxes to fixed point attractors, multipartite correlations in the stationary state either do not scale extensively with $N$, or the extensive scaling is not robust to small perturbations of the system parameters. In particular, robust extensive scaling cannot occur in thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, mutual information scales extensively when the system relaxes to time-dependent attractors (e.g., limit cycles), which can occur only far from equilibrium. This demonstrates the essential role of dissipation in the generation and maintenance of multipartite correlations. We illustrate our theory with the nonequilibrium Potts model.</description>

      <title>Coarsening in the Long-range Ising Model with Conserved Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the kinetics of domain growth, even for conserved order-parameter dynamics, is widely studied for short-range inter-particle interactions, systems having long-range interactions are receiving attention only recently. Here we present results, for such dynamics, from a Monte Carlo (MC) study of the two-dimensional long-range Ising model, with critical compositions of up and down spins. The order parameter in the MC simulations was conserved via the incorporation of the Kawasaki spin-exchange method. The simulation results for domain growth, following quenches of the homogeneous systems to temperatures below the critical values $T_c$, were analyzed via finite-size scaling and other advanced methods. The outcomes reveal that the growths follow power-laws, with the exponent having interesting dependence on the range of interaction. Quite interstingly, when the range is above a cut-off, the exponent, for any given range, changes from a larger value to a smaller one, during the evolution process. While the corresponding values at late times match with certain theoretical predictions for the conserved order-parameter dynamics, the ones at the early times appear surprisingly high, quite close to the theoretical values for the nonconserved case.</description>

      <title>Post-measurement Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our `post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</description>

      <title>Instability of steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.</description>

      <title>Gibbons-Hawking action for electrically charged black holes in the canonical ensemble and Davies' thermodynamic theory of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the connection between the Gibbons-Hawking Euclidean path integral approach applied to the canonical ensemble of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and the thermodynamic theory of black holes of Davies. We build the ensemble, characterized by a reservoir at infinity at temperature $T$ and electric charge $Q$, in $d$ dimensions. The Euclidean path integral yields the action and partition function. In zero loop, we uncover two solutions, one with horizon radius $r_{+1}$ the least massive, the other with $r_{+2}$. We find a saddle point separating the solutions at $T_s$ and $Q_s$ with radius $r_{+s}$. For $T &gt; T_s$ there is only hot flat space with charge at infinity. We derive the thermodynamics. The heat capacity gives that $T_s$ and $Q_s$ separate stable, $r_{+1}$, from unstable, $r_{+2}$ , solutions, the phase transition being second order. The free energy of the stable solution is positive, so if the system is a black hole it makes a first order transition to hot space. An interpretation of the results as energy wavelengths is attempted. For $d = 4$, the thermodynamics from the path integral applied to the canonical ensemble is precisely the Davies thermodynamics theory of black holes, with $T_s$ being the Davies point. We sketch the case $d = 5$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Boltzmann machine learning of ground-state energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a novel quantum circuit construction that combines classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test, thus overcoming a key obstacle to quantum Boltzmann machine learning that has been left open since [Amin \textit{et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~X \textbf{8}, 021050 (2018)]. Additionally supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous normalizing flows are known to be highly expressive and flexible, which allows for easier incorporation of large symmetries and makes them a powerful tool for sampling in lattice field theories. Building on previous work, we present a general continuous normalizing flow architecture for matrix Lie groups that is equivariant under group transformations. We apply this to lattice gauge theories in two dimensions as a proof-of-principle and demonstrate competitive performance, showing its potential as a tool for future lattice sampling tasks.</description>

      <title>A theoretical perspective on mode collapse in variational inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning has expanded the possibilities for highly expressive variational families, the practical benefits of these tools for variational inference (VI) are often limited by the minimization of the traditional Kullback-Leibler objective, which can yield suboptimal solutions. A major challenge in this context is \emph{mode collapse}: the phenomenon where a model concentrates on a few modes of the target distribution during training, despite being statistically capable of expressing them all. In this work, we carry a theoretical investigation of mode collapse for the gradient flow on Gaussian mixture models. We identify the key low-dimensional statistics characterizing the flow, and derive a closed set of low-dimensional equations governing their evolution. Leveraging this compact description, we show that mode collapse is present even in statistically favorable scenarios, and identify two key mechanisms driving it: mean alignment and vanishing weight. Our theoretical findings are consistent with the implementation of VI using normalizing flows, a class of popular generative models, thereby offering practical insights.</description>

      <title>Curling morphology of knitted fabrics: Structure and Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knitted fabrics are two-dimensional-like structures formed by stitching one-dimensional yarn into three-dimensional curves. Plain stitch or stockinette stitch, one of the most fundamental knitting stitches, consists of periodic lattices of bent yarns, where three-dimensional (3D) curling behavior naturally emerges at the edges. The elasticity and geometry of knitted fabrics have been studied in previous studies, primarily based on 2D modeling. Still, the relation between 3D geometry and the mechanics of knitted fabrics has not been clarified so far. The curling behavior of knits is intricately related to the forces and moments acting on the yarns, geometry of the unit knitted loops, mechanical properties, and contacts, hence requiring a 3D analysis. Here, we show that the curling of plain knits emerges through the elasticity and geometry of the knitted loops, combining desktop-scale experiments and reduced elasticity-based simulations. We find that by changing the horizontal and vertical knitting numbers, three types of curl shapes emerge: side curl and top/bottom curl shapes, which are curled only horizontally and vertically, and double curl shape, in which both curl shapes appear together. The fundamental mechanism of intricate shape deformation is clarified through the force and moment balance along yarn whose centerline shape is discretized through the B-spline curves where elastic stretching, bending, and contact mechanics are taken into account. We reveal that the 3D structure of the single-knitted loop plays a critical role in the curling behavior. Our results imply that the change in shape per a single knitted loop has the potential to control the 3D natural overall shape of knitted fabrics, and could be applied in predicting or designing more complex 3D shapes made of knitted fabrics.</description>

      <title>Emergent spacetime supersymmetry in an interacting Kitaev chain with explicit supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in an interacting Kitaev chain model with explicit microscopic $\mathcal{N}=1$ quantum mechanical SUSY. As the interaction strength is varied, the model transitions from a weak-coupling gapless phase with spontaneously broken SUSY to a strong-coupling phase with restored SUSY. In this paper, we numerically determine the transition point and investigate the phase structure around it. The weak-coupling phase is governed by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1/2$ which agrees with the prediction made in our previous work and that the SUSY restoration transition which borders the strong-coupling gapped phase belongs to the $c=7/10$ tricritical Ising universality with emergent superconformal invariance. Crucially, the phase structure around the transition closely aligns with the scenario proposed by Zamolodchikov and others based on the integrable deformation of CFTs. These findings provide a concrete example of a lattice model where explicit microscopic supersymmetry at criticality, enriches the understanding of phase transitions governed by supersymmetric conformal field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By confining colloidal active fluids in microchannel networks, we demonstrate that their degenerate flows corresponds to the configurations of the six-vertex model. We use this quantitative correspondence to control and explain the active flows that emerge in square grid networks. In particular, we show that the Lagrangian trajectories of active particles realize the Baxter-Kelland-Wu mapping and form completely packed loops, whose geometry can be exactly predicted and explained. We then go beyond the square-grid geometry and introduce a general framework for predicting the geometry of active-hydraulic flows in arbitrary networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spin-1 version of the random energy model with crystal field. Crystal field controls the density of 0 spins in the system. We solve the model in the micro-canonincal ensemble. The model has a spin-glass transition at a finite temperature for all strengths of the crystal field. By introducing the magnetic field we also obtain the de Almeida Thouless line for the model. The spin-glass transition persists in the presence of external field. We also find that the magnetisation shows non-monotonic behaviour for high positive crystal field strengths. The zero magnetic field specific heat and magnetic susceptibility also exhibit a cusp beyond a threshold value of the crystal field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stress distribution in pastes after horizontal rotation by using an elasto-plastic model. Residual stress remains as a memory of rotation. The stress in the circumferential direction increases after the rotation, whereas that in the radial direction decreases. The residual stress is analytically related to the plastic deformation induced by the rotation. Based on the time evolution of plastic deformation, we theoretically describe the mechanism of the changes in the stress distribution.</description>

      <title>Million-atom heat transport simulations of polycrystalline graphene approaching first-principles accuracy enabled by neuroevolution potential on desktop GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles molecular dynamics simulations of heat transport in systems with large-scale structural features are challenging due to their high computational cost. Here, using polycrystalline graphene as a case study, we demonstrate the feasibility of simulating heat transport with near first-principles accuracy in systems containing over 1.4 million atoms, achievable even with consumer desktop GPUs. This is enabled by the highly efficient neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach, as implemented in the open-source GPUMD package. Leveraging the NEP model's accuracy and efficiency, we quantify the reduction in thermal conductivity of polycrystalline graphene due to grain boundaries with varying grain sizes, resolving contributions from in-plane and out-of-plane (flexural) phonon modes. Additionally, we find that grain boundaries can lead to finite thermal conductivity even under significant tensile strain, in contrast to the divergent behavior observed in pristine graphene under similar conditions, indicating that grain boundaries may play a crucial role in thermal transport in low-dimensional momentum-conserving systems. These findings could offer insights for interpreting experimental observations, given the widespread presence of both large-scale grain boundaries and external strains in real materials. The demonstrated ability to simulate millions of atoms with near-first-principles accuracy on consumer desktop GPUs using the NEP approach will help make large-scale high-fidelity atomistic simulations more accessible to the broader research community.</description>

      <title>Path integral Monte Carlo in a discrete variable representation with Gibbs sampling: dipolar planar rotor chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach based on discretized continuous degrees of freedom and rejection-free Gibbs sampling. The ground state properties of a chain of planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions are used to illustrate the approach. Energetic and structural properties are computed and compared to exact diagonalization and Numerical Matrix Multiplication for $N \leq 3$ to assess the systematic Trotter factorization error convergence. For larger chains with up to N = 100 rotors, Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations are used as a benchmark. We show that using Gibbs sampling is advantageous compared to traditional Metroplolis-Hastings rejection importance sampling. Indeed, Gibbs sampling leads to lower variance and correlation in the computed observables.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking meets average symmetry-protected topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have unveiled new possibilities for discovering intrinsic quantum phases that are unique to open systems, including phases with average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) order and strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) order in systems with global symmetry. In this work, we propose a new class of phases, termed the double ASPT phase, which emerges from a nontrivial extension of these two orders. This new phase is absent from prior studies and cannot exist in conventional closed systems. Using the recently developed imaginary-Lindbladian formalism, we explore the phase diagram of a one-dimensional open system with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. We identify universal critical behaviors along each critical line and observe the emergence of an intermediate phase that completely breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}$ symmetry, leading to the formation of two triple points in the phase diagram. These two triple points are topologically distinct and connected by a domain-wall decoration duality map. Our results promote the establishment of a complete classification for quantum phases in open systems with various symmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical Monte Carlo simulation of opinion dynamics under the influence of mass media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of large social groups having uniform opinions influenced by mass media is currently an important topic in the social sciences. In this work, we explore and extend an off-lattice, two-dimensional Potts model (Eur. Phys. J. B 87, 78 [2014]) that describes the formation and dynamics of opinions in social groups according to individual consequence and agreement between neighbors. This model was originally obtained by the application of the maximum entropy principle, a general method in statistical inference, and using the same methodology we have now included the influence of mass media as a constant external field. By means of microcanonical Monte Carlo Metropolis simulations on a setup with two regions with opposing external influences, we have shown the presence of metastable states associated to the formation of clusters aligned with the locally imposed opinion. Our results suggest that, for some values of the total energy of the system, only a single cluster with a uniform opinion survives, thus the presence of two large, opposing groups is not a thermodynamically stable configuration.</description>

      <title>Influence of Topology on Rheological Properties of Polymer Ring Melts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate with numerical simulations the influence of topology and stiffness on macroscopic rheological properties of polymer melts consisting of unknotted, knotted or concatenated rings. While melts of flexible, knotted oligomer rings tend to be significantly more viscous than their unknotted counterparts, differences vanish in a low shear rate scenario with increasing degree of polymerization. Melts of catenanes consisting of two rings on the other hand are consistently more viscous than their unconcatenated counterparts. These topology-based differences in rheological properties can be exploited to segregate mixtures of otherwise chemically similar polymers, e.g., in microfluidic devices, which is demonstrated by exposing a blend of flexible knotted and unknotted oligomer rings to channel flow.</description>

      <title>Discrete distributions are learnable from metastable samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chain samplers designed to sample from multi-variable distributions often undesirably get stuck in specific regions of their state space. This causes such samplers to approximately sample from a metastable distribution which is usually quite different from the desired, stationary distribution of the chain. We show that single-variable conditionals of metastable distributions of reversible Markov chain samplers that satisfy a strong metastability condition are on average very close to those of the true distribution. This holds even when the metastable distribution is far away from the true model in terms of global metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance. This property allows us to learn the true model using a conditional likelihood based estimator, even when the samples come from a metastable distribution concentrated in a small region of the state space. Explicit examples of such metastable states can be constructed from regions that effectively bottleneck the probability flow and cause poor mixing of the Markov chain. For specific cases of binary pairwise undirected graphical models, we extend our results to further rigorously show that data coming from metastable states can be used to learn the parameters of the energy function and recover the structure of the model.</description>

Abstract: We consider the probability distributions of the subsystem (staggered) magnetization in ordered and disordered models of quantum magnets in D dimensions. We focus on Heisenberg antiferromagnets and long-range transverse-field Ising models as particular examples. By employing a range of self-consistent time-dependent mean-field approximations in conjunction with Holstein-Primakoff, Dyson-Maleev, Schwinger boson and modified spin-wave theory representations we obtain results in thermal equilibrium as well as during non-equilibrium evolution after quantum quenches. To extract probability distributions we derive a simple formula for the characteristic function of generic quadratic observables in any Gaussian theory of bosons.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy in dynamic complex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of complex networks studies a wide variety of interacting systems by representing them as networks. To understand their properties and mutual relations, the randomisation of network connections is a commonly used tool. However, information-theoretic randomisation methods with well-established foundations mostly provide a stationary description of these systems, while stochastic randomisation methods that account for their dynamic nature lack such general foundations and require extensive repetition of the stochastic process to measure statistical properties. In this work, we extend the applicability of information-theoretic methods beyond stationary network models. By using the information-theoretic principle of maximum caliber we construct dynamic network ensemble distributions based on constraints representing statistical properties with known values throughout the evolution. We focus on the particular cases of dynamics constrained by the average number of connections of the whole network and each node, comparing each evolution to simulations of stochastic randomisation that obey the same constraints. We find that ensemble distributions estimated from simulations match those calculated with maximum caliber and that the equilibrium distributions to which they converge agree with known results of maximum entropy given the same constraints. Finally, we discuss further the connections to other maximum entropy approaches to network dynamics and conclude by proposing some possible avenues of future research.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the antiperiodic XXZ chain with anisotropy parameter {\eta}=i{\pi}/3 by means of the t-W method. We parameterize the eigenvalues of both the transfer matrix and the corresponding fused transfer matrix by their zero points instead of Bethe roots. Based on the patterns of the zero points distribution and the reconstructed entropy, we obtain the nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) describing the thermodynamics of the model and compute its free energy at a finite temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the complex connectivity structure of the brain shapes its information-processing capabilities is a long-standing question. By focusing on a paradigmatic architecture, we study how the neural activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations encodes information on external signals. We show that at long times information is maximized at the edge of stability, where inhibition balances excitation, both in linear and nonlinear regimes. In the presence of multiple external signals, this maximum corresponds to the entropy of the input dynamics. By analyzing the case of a prolonged stimulus, we find that stronger inhibition is instead needed to maximize the instantaneous sensitivity, revealing an intrinsic trade-off between short-time responses and long-time accuracy. In agreement with recent experimental findings, our results pave the way for a deeper information-theoretic understanding of how the balance between excitation and inhibitions controls optimal information-processing in neural populations.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the effective diffusion constant $D_{{\it eff}}$ for stochastic processes with spatially-dependent noise. Starting from a stochastic process given by a Langevin equation, different drift-diffusion equations can be derived depending on the choice of the discretization rule $ 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$. We initially study the case of periodic heterogeneous diffusion without drift and we determine a general result for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{{\it eff}}$, which is valid for any value of $\alpha$. We study the case of periodic sinusoidal diffusion in detail and we find a relationship with Legendre functions. Then, we derive $D_{{\it eff}}$ for general $\alpha$ in the case of diffusion with periodic spatial noise and in the presence of a drift term, generalizing the Lifson-Jackson theorem. Our results are illustrated by analytical and numerical calculations on generic periodic choices for drift and diffusion terms.</description>

Abstract: Will the strategy of resetting} help a stochastic process to reach its target efficiently, with its environment continually toggling between a strongly favourable and an unfavourable (or weakly favourable) state? A diffusive run-and-tumble motion, transport of molecular motors on or off a filament, and motion under flashing optical traps are special examples of such state toggling. For any general process with toggling under Poisson reset, we derive a mathematical condition for continuous transitions where the advantage rendered by resetting vanishes. For the case of diffusive motion with linear potentials of unequal strength, we present exact solutions which reveal that there is quite generically a re-entrance of the advantage of resetting as a function of the strength of the strongly favourable potential. This result is shown to be valid for quadratic potential traps by using the general condition of transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the statistics of conformations of a linear polymer in a solvent. The polymer is allowed to form double polymers. We closely follow a classical technique to derive a field theory for the problem from an $O\left(n\right)$ symmetric spin model. The field theory is a model for RNA or DNA with constant binding energy per monomer.
  It is shown that there is a stable renormalization group fixed point, at which the double polymer decouples from the single-strand polymer and becomes a branched polymer of the conventional type with a three-point interaction. To reach this fixed point, at least one parameter must be adjusted. The critical dimension is eight. Fisher-renormalization, equation of state and critical exponents are reproduced in this limit. The single-strand polymer depends on the double-strand polymer and disappears at the critical point, but has its own critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Modified Landauer's principle: How much can the Maxwell's demon gain by using general system-environment quantum state?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer principle states that decrease in entropy of a system, inevitably leads to a dissipation of heat to the environment. This statement is usually established by considering the system to be in contact with an environment that is initially in a thermal state, with the system-environment initial state being in a product state. Here we show that a modified Landauer principle, with correction terms, still holds even if the system and environment are initially correlated and the environment is in an athermal state. This is the most general quantum mechanically allowed operation in the Maxwell demon's arsenal, and, in particular, includes non-completely positive but physically realizable maps on the system. The correction terms provide an advantage: they reduce the work required by the Maxwell's demon to erase its memory. The modified principle also incorporates the possibility of arbitrary charge flows, including the usual heat flow, between system and environment. Furthermore, we consider a case where the system is in contact with a large initially-decoupled athermal environment, and we derive the finite-time modified Landauer's bound for the same.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Glycerol acts as a natural cryoprotectant by depressing the temperature of ice nucleation and slowing down the dynamics of water mixtures. In this work we characterize dynamics -- diffusion, viscosity, and hydrogen-bond dynamics -- as well as density anomaly and structure of water mixtures with 1\% to 50\% w/w glycerol at low temperatures via molecular dynamics simulations using all-atom and coarse-grained models. Simulations reveal distinct violations of the Stokes-Einsten relation in the low temperature regime for water and glycerol. Deviations are positive for water at all concentrations, and positive for glycerol in very dilute solutions but turning negative in concentrated ones. The all-atom and coarse-grained models reveal an unexpected crossover in the dynamics of the 1% and 10 % w/w glycerol at the lowest simulated temperatures. This crossover manifests in the diffusion coefficients of water and glycerol, as well as in the viscosity and lifetime of hydrogen-bonds in water. We interpret that the crossover originates on the opposing dependence with glycerol concentration of the two factors controlling the solution's slow-down: the increase in tetrahedrally coordinated water and the dynamics and clustering of the glycerol molecules. We anticipate that this dynamic crossover will also occur for solution of water with other polyols.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>LifeGPT: Topology-Agnostic Generative Pretrained Transformer Model for Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conway's Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model to solve this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions (LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an `autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large language model framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>
