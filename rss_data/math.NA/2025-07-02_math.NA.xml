      <title>Computational Insights into Orthotropic Fracture: Crack-Tip Fields in Strain-Limiting Materials under Non-Uniform Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite element framework is presented for analyzing crack-tip phenomena in transversely isotropic, strain-limiting elastic materials. Mechanical response is characterized by an algebraically nonlinear constitutive model, relating stress to linearized strain. Non-physical strain singularities at the crack apex are mitigated, ensuring bounded strain magnitudes. This methodology significantly advances boundary value problem (BVP) formulation, especially for first-order approximate theories. For a transversely isotropic elastic solid with a crack, the governing equilibrium equation, derived from linear momentum balance and the nonlinear constitutive model, is reduced to a second-order, vector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. This BVP is solved using a robust numerical scheme combining Picard-type linearization with a continuous Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization. Numerical results are presented for various loading conditions, including uniform tension, non-uniform slope, and parabolic loading, with two distinct material fiber orientations. It is demonstrated that crack-tip strain growth is substantially lower than stress growth. Nevertheless, strain-energy density is found to be concentrated at the crack tip, consistent with linear elastic fracture mechanics principles. The proposed framework provides a robust basis for formulating physically meaningful, rigorous BVPs, critical for investigating fundamental processes like crack propagation, damage, and nucleation in anisotropic, strain-limiting elastic solids under diverse loading conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Intensity-based Inversion Method for Quantitative Quasi-Static Elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the intensity-based inversion method (IIM) for quantitative material parameter estimation in quasi-static elastography. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the material parameters of a given sample from two internal measurements, one obtained before and one after applying some form of deformation. These internal measurements can be obtained via any imaging modality of choice, for example ultrasound, optical coherence or photo-acoustic tomography. Compared to two-step approaches to elastography, which first estimate internal displacement fields or strains and then reconstruct the material parameters from them, the IIM is a one-step approach which computes the material parameters directly from the internal measurements. To do so, the IIM combines image registration together with a model-based, regularized parameter reconstruction approach. This combination has the advantage of avoiding some approximations and derivative computations typically found in two-step approaches, and results in the IIM being generally more stable to measurement noise. In the paper, we provide a full convergence analysis of the IIM within the framework of inverse problems, and detail its application to linear elastography. Furthermore, we discuss the numerical implementation of the IIM and provide numerical examples simulating an optical coherence elastography (OCE) experiment.</description>

      <title>A fourth-order exponential time differencing scheme with real and distinct poles rational approximation for solving non-linear reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fourth-order, L-stable, exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta type scheme is developed to solve nonlinear systems of reaction diffusion equations with nonsmooth data. The new scheme, ETDRK4RDP, is constructed by approximating the matrix exponentials in the ETDRK4 scheme with a fourth order, L-acceptable, non-Pad\'e rational function having real and distinct poles (RDP). Using RDP rational functions to construct the scheme ensures efficient damping of spurious oscillations arising from non-smooth initial and boundary conditions and a straightforward parallelization. We verify empirically that the new ETDRK4RDP scheme is fourth-order accurate for several reaction diffusion systems with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and show it to be more efficient than competing exponential time differencing schemes, especially when implemented in parallel, with up to six times speedup in CPU time.</description>

      <title>Stability and error analysis of a new class of higher-order consistent splitting schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of fully decoupled consistent splitting schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations are constructed and analyzed in this paper. The schemes are based on the Taylor expansion at $t^{n+\beta}$ with $\beta\ge 1$ being a free parameter. It is shown that by choosing {\color{black} $\beta= 3, \,6,\,9$} respectively for the second-, third- and fourth-order schemes, their numerical solutions are uniformed bounded in a strong norm, and admit optimal global-in-time convergence rates in both 2D and 3D. {\color{black}These } results are the first stability and convergence results for any fully decoupled, higher than second-order schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results are provided to show that the third- and fourth-order schemes based on the usual BDF (i.e. $\beta=1$) are not unconditionally stable while the new third- and fourth-order schemes with suitable $\beta$ are unconditionally stable and lead to expected convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Preserving and Accurate scheme for Multiscale Poisson-Nernst-Planck (MPNP) system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and validate a two-species Multiscale model for a Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system, focusing on the correlated motion of positive and negative ions under the influence of a trap. Specifically, we aim to model surface traps whose attraction range, of length delta, is much smaller then the scale of the problem. The physical setup we refer to is an anchored gas drop (bubble) surrounded by a diffusive flow of charged surfactants (ions). When the diffusing surfactants reach the surface of the trap, the anions are adsorbed. As in our previous works [11,6,9,4], the effect of the attractive potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The novelty of this work is the extension of the model proposed in [11], now incorporating the influence of both carriers - positive and negative ions - simultaneously, which is often neglected in traditional approaches that treat ion species independently. In the second part of the paper, we address the treatment of the Coulomb interaction between carriers. When the Debye length lambda_D (proportional to a small parameter epsilon) is very small, one can adopt the so-called Quasi-Neutral limit, which significantly simplifies the system, reducing it to a diffusion equation for a single carriers with effective diffusion coefficient [36,53]. This approach, while simplifying the mathematical model, does not capture the effects of non negligible values of epsilon. When the Debye length is small but not negligible, it may be very expensive to capture the small deviation from the Quasi-Neutral limit by standard methods in the literature. [...]</description>

      <title>A surface finite element scheme for a stochastic PDE on an evolving curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an ESFEM method for the advection and diffusion of a scalar quantity on a moving closed curve. The diffusion process is controlled by a forcing term that may include a rough term (specifically a stochastic noise) which in particular destroys the classical time differentiability properties of the solution. We provide a suitable variational solution concept and a fully discrete FEM discretization. Our error analysis appropriately generalizes classical estimates to this weaker setting. We present some numerical simulations that confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Learned Sparse Grid Quadrature Rules using NeuralODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a proof of the consistency of sparse grid quadrature for numerical integration of high dimensional distributions. In a first step, a transport map is learned that normalizes the distribution to a noise distribution on the unit cube. This step is built on the statistical learning theory of neural ordinary differential equations, which has been established recently. Secondly, the composition of the generative map with the quantity of interest is integrated numerically using the Clenshaw-Curtis sparse grid quadrature. A decomposition of the total numerical error in quadrature error and statistical error is provided. As main result it is proven in the framework of empirical risk minimization that all error terms can be controlled in the sense of PAC (probably approximately correct) learning and with high probability the numerical integral approximates the theoretical value up to an arbitrary small error in the limit where the data set size is growing and the network capacity is increased adaptively.</description>

      <title>A mixed Petrov--Galerkin Cosserat rod finite element formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a total Lagrangian mixed Petrov--Galerkin finite element formulation that provides a computationally efficient approach for analyzing Cosserat rods that is free of singularities and locking. To achieve a singularity-free orientation parametrization of the rod, the nodal kinematical unknowns are defined as the nodal centerline positions and unit quaternions. We apply Lagrangian interpolation to all nodal kinematic coordinates, and in combination with a projection of non-unit quaternions, this leads to an interpolation with orthonormal cross-section-fixed bases. To eliminate locking effects such as shear locking, the variational Hellinger--Reissner principle is applied, resulting in a mixed approach with additional fields composed of resultant contact forces and moments. Since the mixed formulation contains the constitutive law in compliance form, it naturally incorporates constrained theories, such as the Kirchhoff--Love theory. This study specifically examines the influence of the additional internal force fields on the numerical performance, including locking mitigation and robustness. Using well-established benchmark examples, the method demonstrates enhanced computational robustness and efficiency, as evidenced by the reduction in required load steps and iterations when applying the standard Newton--Raphson method.</description>

      <title>A trust-region framework for optimization using Hermite kernel surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a trust-region optimization framework that employs Hermite kernel surrogate models. The method targets optimization problems with computationally demanding objective functions, for which direct optimization is often impractical due to expensive function evaluations. To address these challenges, we leverage a trust-region strategy, where the objective function is approximated by an efficient surrogate model within a local neighborhood of the current iterate. In particular, we construct the surrogate using Hermite kernel interpolation and define the trust-region based on bounds for the interpolation error. As mesh-free techniques, kernel-based methods are naturally suited for medium- to high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, the Hermite formulation incorporates gradient information, enabling precise gradient estimates that are crucial for many optimization algorithms. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments, which illustrate the convergence behavior as well as the efficiency gains compared to direct optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a stable and high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method for the second order wave equation, specifically designed to handle nonsmooth solutions. Our approach integrates the energy-based discontinuous Galerkin method with the oscillation-free technique to effectively suppress spurious oscillations near solution discontinuities. Both stability analysis and apriori error estimates are established for common choices of numerical fluxes. We present a series of numerical experiments to confirm the optimal convergence rates for smooth solutions and its robustness in maintaining oscillation-free behavior for nonsmooth solutions in wave equations without or with nonlinear source terms.</description>

      <title>Global Energy Minimization for Simplex Mesh Optimization: A Radius Ratio Approach to Sliver Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of simplex mesh is crucial for the stability and accuracy of numerical simulations in finite element analysis and computational geometry. However, the presence of sliver elements in 3D simplex mesh can severely impact the results. This paper presents a novel method based on a radius ratio energy function to optimize the quality of simplex mesh elements. This method can effectively eliminate sliver elements, thereby enhancing mesh quality.The gradient of the proposed energy function can be decomposed into a matrix-vector product. With minor processing, the matrix becomes symmetric positive definite, and this symmetric positive definite matrix can serve as a preconditioner to significantly accelerate the optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in eliminating sliver elements and improving mesh quality.</description>

      <title>GPU-based complete search for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.</description>

      <title>The inverse source problem of stochastic wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the ill-posedness of the inverse source problem for the one-dimensional stochastic Helmholtz equations without attenuation, this study develops a novel computational framework designed to mitigate this inherent challenge at the numerical implementation level. For the stochastic wave equation driven by a finite-jump L\'evy process (assuming that its jump amplitude obeys a Gaussian distribution and the jump time interval obeys a Poisson distribution), this paper firstly establish the existence of a mild solution to its direct problem satisfying a particular stability estimate. Building upon these theoretical foundations, we further investigate the well-posedness of the inverse problem and develop a methodology to reconstruct the unknown source terms $f$ and $g$ using the data of the wave field at the final time point $u(x,T)$. This work not only provides rigorous theoretical analysis and effective numerical schemes for solving inverse source problems in these two specific classes of stochastic wave equations, but also offers new perspectives and methodological approaches for addressing a broader range of wave propagation inverse problems characterized by non-Gaussian stochastic properties. The proposed framework demonstrates significant relevance for characterizing physical phenomena influenced by jump-type stochastic perturbations, offering promising applications in diverse domains including but not limited to seismic wave propagation analysis and financial market volatility modeling.</description>

      <title>Neural Entropy-stable conservative flux form neural networks for learning hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural entropy-stable conservative flux form neural network (NESCFN) for learning hyperbolic conservation laws and their associated entropy functions directly from solution trajectories, without requiring any predefined numerical discretization. While recent neural network architectures have successfully integrated classical numerical principles into learned models, most rely on prior knowledge of the governing equations or assume a fixed discretization. Our approach removes this dependency by embedding entropy-stable design principles into the learning process itself, enabling the discovery of physically consistent dynamics in a fully data-driven setting. By jointly learning both the numerical flux function and a corresponding entropy, the proposed method ensures conservation and entropy dissipation, critical for long-term stability and fidelity in the system of hyperbolic conservation laws. Numerical results demonstrate that the method achieves stability and conservation over extended time horizons and accurately captures shock propagation speeds, even without oracle access to future-time solution profiles in the training data.</description>

      <title>Faber polynomials in a deltoid region and power iteration momentum methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a region in the complex plane enclosed by a deltoid curve inscribed in the unit circle, and define a family of polynomials $P_n$ that satisfy the same recurrence relation as the Faber polynomials for this region. We use this family of polynomials to give a constructive proof that $z^n$ is approximately a polynomial of degree $\sim\sqrt{n}$ within the deltoid region. Moreover, we show that $|P_n| \le 1$ in this deltoid region, and that, if $|z| = 1+\varepsilon$, then the magnitude $|P_n(z)|$ is at least $\frac{1}{3}(1+\sqrt{\varepsilon})^n$, for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We illustrate our polynomial approximation theory with an application to iterative linear algebra. In particular, we construct a higher-order momentum-based method that accelerates the power iteration for certain matrices with complex eigenvalues. We show how the method can be run dynamically when the two dominant eigenvalues are real and positive.</description>

      <title>PDE-Constrained High-Order Mesh Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for PDE-constrained $r$-adaptivity of high-order meshes. The proposed method formulates mesh movement as an optimization problem, with an objective function defined as a convex combination of a mesh quality metric and a measure of the accuracy of the PDE solution obtained via finite element discretization. The proposed formulation achieves optimized, well-defined high-order meshes by integrating mesh quality control, PDE solution accuracy, and robust gradient regularization. We adopt the Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm to control geometric properties across the mesh, independent of the PDE of interest. To incorporate the accuracy of the PDE solution, we introduce error measures that control the finite element discretization error. The implicit dependence of these error measures on the mesh nodal positions is accurately captured by adjoint sensitivity analysis. Additionally, a convolution-based gradient regularization strategy is used to ensure stable and effective adaptation of high-order meshes. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve mesh quality and reduce the error by up to 10 times for the solution of Poisson and linear elasto-static problems. The approach is general with respect to the dimensionality, the order of the mesh, the types of mesh elements, and can be applied to any PDE that admits well-defined adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Preconditioning for Time-Dependent Variational Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of a time-dependent variational mean field game system with local couplings and either periodic or Neumann boundary conditions. Following a variational approach, we employ a finite difference discretization and solve the resulting finite-dimensional optimization problem using the Chambolle--Pock primal--dual algorithm. As this involves computing proximal operators and solving ill-conditioned linear systems at each iteration, we propose a general class of parallel-in-time preconditioners based on diagonalization techniques using discrete Fourier transforms. These enable efficient, scalable iterative solvers with robustness across a wide range of viscosities. We further develop fast solvers for the resulting ill-conditioned systems arising at each time step, using exact recursive schemes for structured grids while allowing for other geometries. Numerical experiments confirm the improved performance and parallel scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically extended symplectic numerical simulation of viscoelastic, thermal expansion and heat conduction phenomena in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12120v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic numerical schemes for reversible dynamical systems predict the solution reliably over large times as well, and are a good starting point for extension to schemes for simulating irreversible situations like viscoelastic wave propagation and heat conduction coupled via thermal expansion occuring in rocks, plastics, biological samples etc. Dissipation error (artificial nonpreservation of energies and amplitudes) of the numerical solution should be as small as possible since it should not be confused with the real dissipation occuring in the irreversible system. In addition, the other well-known numerical artefact, dispersion error (artificial oscillations emerging at sharp changes), should also be minimal to avoid confusion with the true wavy behaviour. The continuum thermodynamical aspects (respect for balances with fluxes, systematic constitutive relationships between intensive quantities and fluxes, the second law of thermodynamics with positive definite entropy production, and the spacetime-based kinematic viewpoint) prove valuable for obtaining such extended schemes and for monitoring the solutions. Generalizing earlier works in this direction, here, we establish and investigate such a numerical scheme for one-dimensional viscoelastic wave propagation in the presence of heat conduction coupled via thermal expansion, demonstrating long-term reliability and the applicability of thermodynamics-based quantities in supervising the quality of the solution.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the observable universe from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is a property of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in which photons from the CMB are gravitationally redshifted, causing the anisotropies in the CMB. An intriguing question is whether one can infer the gravitational perturbations from the ISW effect observed near the Earth. In this work, we address the question using a tomographic reconstruction approach, similar to X-ray CT reconstruction in medical imaging. We develop the mathematical analysis for the stable inversion of the X-ray transform in the cosmological setting. In addition, we provide a numerical study of reconstruction methods, thereby demonstrating the feasibility and potential of the tomography method.</description>

      <title>Randomized subspace correction methods for convex optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an abstract framework for randomized subspace correction methods for convex optimization, which unifies and generalizes a broad class of existing algorithms, including domain decomposition, multigrid, and block coordinate descent methods. We provide a convergence rate analysis ranging from minimal assumptions to more practical settings, such as sharpness and strong convexity. While most existing studies on block coordinate descent methods focus on nonoverlapping decompositions and smooth or strongly convex problems, our framework extends to more general settings involving arbitrary space decompositions, inexact local solvers, and problems with limited smoothness or convexity. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to convex optimization problems arising in areas such as nonlinear partial differential equations, imaging, and data science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) techniques with uncertainty quantification (UQ) represents a rapidly evolving frontier in computational science. This work advances Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by incorporating probabilistic frameworks to effectively model uncertainty in complex systems. Our approach enhances the representation of uncertainty in forward problems by combining generative modeling techniques with PINNs. This integration enables in a systematic fashion uncertainty control while maintaining the predictive accuracy of the model. We demonstrate the utility of this method through applications to random differential equations and random partial differential equations (PDEs).</description>

      <title>A first-order method for nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems under a local Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition that may vary with the outer minimization variable. In contrast to the global KL or Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) conditions commonly assumed in the literature -- which are significantly stronger and often too restrictive in practice -- this local KL condition accommodates a broader range of practical scenarios. However, it also introduces new analytical challenges. In particular, as an optimization algorithm progresses toward a stationary point of the problem, the region over which the KL condition holds may shrink, resulting in a more intricate and potentially ill-conditioned landscape. To address this challenge, we show that the associated maximal function is locally H\"older smooth. Leveraging this key property, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for solving the minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed by applying a proximal gradient method to a KL-structured subproblem. Under mild assumptions, we establish complexity guarantees for computing an approximate stationary point of the minimax problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider the surface Stokes equation with Lagrange multiplier and approach it numerically. Using a Taylor-Hood surface finite element method, along with an appropriate estimate for the additional Lagrange multiplier, we derive a new inf-sup condition to help with the stability and convergence results. We establish optimal velocity convergence both in energy and tangential $L^2$ norms, along with optimal $L^2$ norm convergence for the two pressures, in the case of super-parametric finite elements. Furthermore, if the approximation order of the velocities matches that of the extra Lagrange multiplier, we achieve optimal order convergence even in the standard iso-parametric case. In this case, we also establish some new estimates for the normal $L^2$ velocity norm. In addition, we provide numerical simulations that confirm the established error bounds and also perform a comparative analysis against the penalty approach.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces finite element methods for a class of elliptic fully nonlinear partial differential equations. They are based on a minimal residual principle that builds upon the Alexandrov--Bakelman--Pucci estimate. Under rather general structural assumptions on the operator, convergence of $C^1$ conforming and discontinuous Galerkin methods is proven in the $L^\infty$ norm. Numerical experiments on the performance of adaptive mesh refinement driven by local information of the residual in two and three space dimensions are provided.</description>

      <title>An artificial viscosity approach to high order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods improve the robustness of high order DG simulations of nonlinear conservation laws. These methods yield a semi-discrete entropy inequality, and rely on an algebraic flux differencing formulation which involves both summation-by-parts (SBP) discretization matrices and entropy conservative two-point finite volume fluxes. However, explicit expressions for such two-point finite volume fluxes may not be available for all systems, or may be computationally expensive to compute.
  This paper proposes an alternative approach to constructing entropy stable DG methods using an entropy correction artificial viscosity, where the artificial viscosity coefficient is determined based on the local violation of a cell entropy inequality and the local entropy dissipation. The resulting method is a modification of the entropy correction introduced by Abgrall, Offner, and Ranocha (2022) in "Reinterpretation and Extension of Entropy Correction Terms for Residual Distribution and Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes: Application to Structure Preserving Discretization", and recovers the same global semi-discrete entropy inequality that is satisfied by entropy stable flux differencing DG methods. The entropy correction artificial viscosity coefficients are parameter-free and locally computable over each cell, and the resulting artificial viscosity preserves both high order accuracy and a hyperbolic maximum stable time-step size under explicit time-stepping.</description>

      <title>An equilibrium-based quasi-3D beam model with rational transverse normal stress expression for accurate analysis of functionally graded beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09127v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although existing quasi-3D beam models can partially account for the influence of transverse stretching deformation, their inability to accurately predict transverse normal stress severely limits their practical value, particularly when applied to functionally graded beams. A key contributing factor to this limitation is the failure of the stress components to satisfy the equilibrium relationships. This paper develops a novel quasi-3D beam models with equilibrium-based transverse normal stress expression for achieving accurate solutions of functionally graded beams. In contrast to the conventional quasi-3D models where stress expressions are derived from constitutive and geometric equations, the expressions of transverse shear stress and transverse normal stress in this study are derived according to the differential equilibrium equations among stresses, ensuring strict adherence of stress solutions to equilibrium conditions. To incorporate the influence of equilibrium-derived stress distributions, the equilibrium-based cross-sectional stiffness matrix is derived, enhancing the theoretical and practical feasibility of the beam model. In the numerical implementation, the mixed element method with generalized internal forces and generalized displacements regarded as two independent fields is employed to construct the beam element, and especially, semi-analytical internal force fields, which partially satisfy the differential equilibrium equations, are introduced to improve the element performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed quasi-3D beam model accurately predicts both displacement and stress fields in functionally graded beams, which exhibits the effectiveness of introducing stress equilibrium relationships.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

Abstract: We use a generic framework, namely the gradient discretisation method (GDM), to propose a unified numerical analysis for general time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction models. We establish novel results for convergence rates of numerical approximations of such models under reasonable assumptions on exact solutions, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the approximate solution for suitably small time steps. The main interest of our results lies in covering several approximation methods and various applications of the considered model such as the generalised Burgers-Fisher (GBF) and the generalised Burgers-Huxley (GBH) models. Numerical tests based on the hybrid mimetic mixed (HMM) method for the GBF model are performed on various types of general meshes to examine the accuracy of the proposed gradient scheme. The results confirm our theoretical rates of convergence, even on mesh with extreme distortions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the Cayley transform that defines a suitable local parameterization for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$. The new mapping is used to construct splitting methods for separable Hamiltonian systems whose phase space is the cotangent bundle of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ or, more general, $\mathrm{SU(3)}^N$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Special attention is given to the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for gauge field generation in lattice quantum chromodynamics. We show that the use of the modified Cayley transform instead of the matrix exponential neither affects the time-reversibility nor the volume-preservation of the splitting method. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the Cayley-based algorithms are discussed and illustrated in pure gauge field simulations.</description>

Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>
