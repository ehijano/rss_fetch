      <title>Exponential phi-mixing implies exponential psi-mixing for Markov fields on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for non-degenerate $k$-Markovian random fields with finite state space over a bounded degree graph with exponential growth rate $\theta$ uniform $\phi$-mixing with exponential decay rate $\lambda &gt; 3\theta$ implies uniform $\psi$-mixing with exponential decay rate $(\lambda - 3\theta)/9$. As an application we obtain exponential $\psi$-mixing for Gibbs fields on regular trees arising from finite range potentials such as the Ising model at low inverse temperature or the Potts model with sufficiently many spin states.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of Volterra integral diffusions and application to contract theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the optimal control of a class of stochastic Volterra integral equations. Here the coefficients are regular and not assumed to be of convolution type. We show that, under mild regularity assumptions, these equations can be lifted in a Sobolev space, whose Hilbertian structure allows us to attack the problem through a dynamic programming approach. We are then able to use the theory of viscosity solutions on Hilbert spaces to characterise the value function of the control problem as the unique solution of a parabolic equation on Sobolev space. We provide applications and examples to illustrate the usefulness of our theory, in particular for a certain class of time inconsistent principal agent problems. As a byproduct of our analysis, we introduce a new Markovian approximation for Volterra type dynamics.</description>

      <title>Martingale dimensions for a class of metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general analytic framework for determining the AF-martingale dimension of diffusion processes associated with strongly local regular Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces. While previous approaches typically relied on self-similarity, our argument is based instead on purely analytic balance conditions between energy measures and relative capacities. Under this localized analytic condition, we prove that the AF-martingale dimension collapses to one, thereby indicating that the intrinsic stochastic structure remains effectively one-dimensional even on highly irregular or inhomogeneous spaces. As a key technical ingredient, our proof employs a simultaneous blow-up and push-forward scheme for harmonic functions and their energy measures, allowing us to control the limiting behavior across scales without invoking heat kernel bounds or explicit geometric models. The main theorem is applied in particular to inhomogeneous Sierpinski gaskets, which do not possess self-similarity or uniform geometric structure. Our method provides a general analytic perspective that can be used to study the one-dimensional probabilistic structure of diffusions through martingale additive functionals.</description>

      <title>Neighbour-count dependent thinning of Poisson processes: correlation structure and Poisson approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a local thinning $T_r$ that retains a point with probability $p(n_r)$, where $n_r$ counts neighbors within radius $r$. For Poisson input with spatially varying intensity, we obtain an exact intensity via a Poisson--mixture formula and a small-radius expansion. For homogeneous input we give a closed-form pair correlation based on the three-region overlap . First-order contact-scale asymptotics identify how the values $p(0),p(1),p(2)$ govern inhibition or clustering. On bounded windows we approximate $T_r(X)$ by a Poisson process with matched intensity through three routes: (i) a direct coupling to an independent thinning giving a total-variation bound; (ii) a Laplace-functional error supported at distances $\le 2r$ and of order $|W|\,\lambda^2 r^d$; and (iii) a Stein bound in the Barbour--Brown $d_2$ metric controlled by $\int_{\|h\|\le 2r} |g(h)-1|\,dh$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic persistence and extinction for degenerate stochastic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical two-dimensional Rosenzweig-MacArthur prey-predator model with a degenerate noise, whereby only the prey variable is subject to small environmental fluctuations. This model has already been introduced in arXiv:1806.08450 and partially investigated by exhibiting conditions ensuring persistence. In this paper, we extend the results to study the conditions for persistence, the uniqueness of an invariant probability measure supported on the interior of $\mathbb R^2_+$ with a smooth density, and convergence in Total variation at a polynomial rate. Our contribution lies in providing a convergence rate in the case of persistence, as well as detailing the situations involving the extinction of one or both species. We also specify all the proofs of the intermediary results supporting our conclusions that are lacking in arXiv:1806.08450.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the well-posedness of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck-Dean-Kawasaki (VFPDK) equation with correlated noise, which arises as a fluctuating mean-field limit of second-order Newtonian particle systems. We focus on the case of bounded nonlocal interactions and a diffusion coefficient of square-root type. In this setting, we prove existence and uniqueness of renormalized kinetic solutions. The proof relies on a novel combination of kinetic semigroup estimates with the framework of renormalized kinetic solutions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reaction Networks Within Interacting Compartments with Content-Dependent Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks with mass-action kinetics provide a useful framework for understanding processes -- biochemical and otherwise -- in homogeneous environments. However, cellular reactions are often compartmentalized, either at the cell level or within cells, and hence non-homogeneous. A general framework for compartmentalized chemistry with dynamic compartments was proposed in (Duso and Zechner, PNAS, 2020), and the special case where the compartment dynamics do not depend on their contents was studied mathematically in (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023). In the present paper, we investigate the case in which the rate of fragmentation of a compartment depends on the abundance of some designated species inside that compartment. The main focus of this work is on providing general conditions for (positive) recurrence and non-explosivity of the models. In particular, we demonstrate that the explosivity characterization from (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023) fails in this setting and provide new sufficient conditions for non-explosivity and positive recurrence, under the assumption that the underlying CRN admits a linear Lyapunov function. These results extend the theoretical foundation for modeling content-mediated compartment dynamics, with implications for systems such as cell division and intracellular transport.</description>

      <title>Malliavin smoothness of the Rosenblatt process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the smoothness of the densities of the finite-dimensional distributions of the Rosenblatt process. Within the Malliavin calculus framework, we prove that Rosenblatt random vectors are nondegenerate in the Malliavin sense. As a consequence, their densities belong to the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions. The proof relies on establishing the existence of all negative moments of the determinant of the Malliavin matrix, exploiting the specific structure of random variables in the second Wiener chaos. In addition, we derive exponential-type upper bounds for the partial derivatives of the densities of the finite-dimensional distributions of the Rosenblatt process.</description>

      <title>Sub-diffusive Black-Scholes model and Girsanov transform for sub-diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Black-Scholes model under which the stock price processes are modeled by stochastic differential equations driven by sub-diffusions. The new framework can capture the less financial activity phenomenon during the bear markets while having the classical Black- Scholes model as its special case. The sub-diffusive spot market is arbitrage-free but is in general incomplete. We investigate the pricing for European-style contingent claims under this new model. For this, we study the Girsanov transform for sub-diffusions and use it to find risk-neutral probability measures for the new Black-Scholes model. Finally, we derive the explicit formula for the price of European call options and show that it can be determined by a partial differential equation (PDE) involving a fractional derivative in time, which we coin a time-fractional Black-Scholes PDE.</description>

      <title>Diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics, a score-based diffusion process recently introduced in the theory of generative models and which is an alternative to the classical overdamped Langevin diffusion. Our goal is to provide a rigorous construction and to study the theoretical efficiency of these models for general base distribution as well as target distribution. As a matter of fact these diffusion processes are a particular case of Nelson processes i.e. diffusion processes with a given flow of time marginals.
  Providing existence and uniqueness of the solution to the annealed Langevin diffusion leads to proving a Poincar\'e inequality for the conditional distribution of $X$ knowing $X+Z=y$ uniformly in $y$, as recently observed by one of us and her coauthors. Part of this work is thus devoted to the study of such Poincar\'e inequalities. Additionally we show that strengthening the Poincar\'e inequality into a logarithmic Sobolev inequality improves the efficiency of the model.</description>

      <title>Continuous Branching Processes with Settlement in Cancer Metastasis: Stochastic Modelling and the Feller Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by models of cancer metastasis, this paper introduces a type of (multi-type) branching process that records the positions of particles, representing tumor cells or clusters. Particles may be absorbed (removed from the state space), move, or settle. The process is rigorously constructed, and the Markov property is established via embedding into a multidimensional process that tracks the labels, positions, and phases (moving or resting) of living particles. The Feller property for the associated semigroup is investigated. It is proved for a simplified model that tracks the number of particles in each class, and an explicit generator is derived, enabling Feynman-Kac-type formulas in this framework.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Burgers Equation Driven by Hermite Sheet: Existence, Uniqueness, and Regularity Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stochastic Burgers' equation driven by a Hermite sheet of order \( q \geq 1 \), establishing well-posedness of mild solutions via fixed-point arguments in suitable Banach spaces. Under appropriate conditions on the Hurst parameters \( \mathbf{H} = (H_0, H_1, \dots, H_d) \in (1/2, 1)^{d+1} \), we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions through a Picard iteration scheme. The solution exhibits spatial and temporal H\"older regularity, with exponents determined by the Hurst parameters of the driving noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the solution inherits the self-similarity property from the Hermite sheet, with explicit scaling exponents connecting temporal and spatial dimensions. Moment estimates are derived uniformly in space and time, providing the foundation for the regularity analysis. The work develops stochastic integration theory with respect to Hermite sheets and establishes a complete framework for analyzing nonlinear SPDEs with non-Gaussian noise, contributing to the understanding of stochastic systems with long-range dependence and non-Gaussian fluctuations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of Crump-Mode-Jagers processes with interaction, constructed by removing a newly born offspring with a probability that depends on the age structure of the population at its birth time. We prove a law of large numbers for the tree structure of the process in a local topology, and show how this result condenses several other limit theorems (convergence of the empirical age distribution, of ancestral lineages). Beyond this specific example, our work illustrates a more general principle that we formalise. As in standard propagation of chaos, the trees generated by typical individuals become independent as the number of individuals goes to infinity. This allows us to express the distribution of the local tree structure around a typical individual in terms of a time-inhomogeneous branching process, which we call a non-linear branching process.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of Brownian Motions on $\mathrm{GL}(N,\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the empirical law of eigenvalues of Brownian motion on the Lie Group $\mathrm{GL}(N,\mathbb{C})$ converges almost surely to a deterministic probability measure, characterized by a free stochastic differential equation. This fully resolves a conjecture made by Philippe Biane in 1997. Our analysis includes a family $\{B=B_{\rho,\zeta}\colon |\zeta|&lt;\rho\}$ of nondegenerate diffusion processes on $\mathrm{GL}(N,\mathbb{C})$ whose laws are invariant under unitary conjugation, with initial distributions assumed to be uniformly bounded and invertible.
  The crux of our analysis is a strong quantitative approximation of Brownian motion $B(t)$ on $\mathrm{GL}(N,\mathbb{C})$ for small $t$ by a single increment $I+W(t)$, where $W=W_{\rho,\zeta}$ is an elliptic Brownian motion in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(N,\mathbb{C}) = \mathbb{M}_N(\mathbb{C})$. Specifically, for any $t\in[0,1]$ and $\delta&gt;0$,
  \[
  \mathbb{P}\left(\|B(t)-I-W(t)\|\geq \delta\right)\leq \left(C t/\delta\right)^{N^{2/3}}
  \]
  for a constant $C=C_\rho$. Leveraging independence of multiplicative increments of the Brownian motion then allows us to use powerful (anti-)concentration tools for Gaussian matrices to complete the Hermitization procedure for convergence of eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove delocalization for the Anderson model on an infinite regular tree (or Cayley graph or Bethe lattice) at low disorder. This extends earlier results of Klein and Aizenman--Warzel by filling in the previously missing parts of the spectrum. Our argument generalizes to any disorder with small fourth moment and sufficiently regular density. We prove continuity of the Lyapunov exponent as the disorder vanishes.</description>

      <title>On the Rigidity of Projected Perturbed Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the occurrence of number rigidity and deletion singularity in a class of point processes that we call {\it projected perturbed lattices}. These are generalizations of processes of the form $\Pi=\{\|z\|^\alpha+g_z\}_{z\in\mathbb{Z}^d}$ where $(g_z)_{z\in\mathbb{Z}^d}$ are jointly Gaussian, $\alpha&gt;0$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, and $\|\cdot\|$ is a norm. We develop a new technique to prove sufficient conditions for the deletion singularity of $\Pi$, which improves significantly on the conditions one can obtain using the standard rigidity toolkit (e.g., the variance of linear statistics). In particular, we obtain the first lower bounds on $\alpha$ for the deletion singularity of $\Pi$ that are independent of the dimension $d$ and the correlation of the $g_z$'s.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for generalised Bernoulli-Laplace urn models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-colour multi-urn generalisation of the Bernoulli-Laplace urn model, consisting of $d$ urns, $m$ colours, and $dmn$ balls, with $dn$ balls of each colour and $mn$ balls in each urn. At each step, one ball is drawn uniformly at random from each urn, and the chosen balls are redistributed among the urns based on a permutation drawn from a distribution $\mu$ on the symmetric group $S_d$. We study the mixing time of this Markov chain for fixed $m$, $d$, and $\mu$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$. We show that there is cutoff whenever the chain on $[d]$ corresponding to the evolution of a single ball is irreducible, and that the same holds for a labeled version of the model. As an application, we also obtain partial results on cutoff for a card shuffling version of the model in which the cards are labeled and their ordering within each stack matters.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that optimal transport suffers from the curse of dimensionality: when the prescribed marginals are approximated by i.i.d. samples, the convergence of the empirical optimal transport problem to the population counterpart slows exponentially with increasing dimension. Entropically regularized optimal transport (EOT) has become the standard bearer in many statistical applications as it avoids this curse. Indeed, EOT has parametric sample complexity, as has been shown in a series of works based on the smoothness of the EOT potentials or the strong concavity of the dual EOT problem. However, EOT produces full-support approximations to the (sparse) OT problem, leading to overspreading in applications, and is computationally unstable for small regularization parameters. The most popular alternative is quadratically regularized optimal transport (QOT), which penalizes couplings by $L^2$ norm instead of relative entropy. QOT produces sparse approximations of OT and is computationally stable. However, its potentials are not smooth (do not belong to a Donsker class) and its dual problem is not strongly concave, hence QOT is often assumed to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we show that QOT nevertheless has parametric sample complexity. More precisely, we establish central limit theorems for its dual potentials, optimal couplings, and optimal costs. Our analysis is based on novel arguments that focus on the regularity of the support of the optimal QOT coupling. Specifically, we establish a Lipschitz property of its sections and leverage VC theory to bound its statistical complexity. Our analysis also leads to gradient estimates of independent interest, including $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the population potentials.</description>

      <title>Hawkes autoregressive processes: a new model for multiscale and heterogeneous processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both Hawkes processes and autoregressive processes depend on linear functionals of their past while modelling different types of data. As different datasets obtained through the recording of the same phenomena may be heterogeneous and occur at different timescales, it is important to study multiscale and heterogenous processes, such as those obtained by combining Hawkes and autoregressive processes. In this paper, we present probabilistic results for this new Hawkes autoregressive (HAR) model, including the existence of a stationary version, a cluster representation, exponential moments and asymptotic behaviour. We also derive statistical results for estimating interactions, extending the well-known LASSO estimation method to Hawkes Autoregressive (HAR) processes.</description>

      <title>Fractional neural attention for efficient multiscale sequence processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through L\'evy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.</description>

      <title>Belief Net: A Filter-Based Framework for Learning Hidden Markov Models from Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.</description>

      <title>Representation and Characterization of Quasistationary Distributions for Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides complete description of Quasistationary Distributions (QSDs) for Markov chains with a unique absorbing state and an irreducible set of non-absorbing states. As is well-known, every QSD has an associated absorption parameter describing the exponential tail of the absorption time under the law of the process with the QSD as the initial distribution. The analysis associated with the existence and representation of QSDs corresponding to a given parameter is according to whether the moment generating function of the absorption time starting from any non-absorbing state evaluated at the parameter is finite or infinite, the finite or infinite moment generating function regimes, respectively. For parameters in the finite regime, it is shown that when exist, all QSDs are in the convex cone of a Martin entry boundary associated with the parameter. The infinite regime corresponds to at most one parameter value and at most one QSD. In this regime, when a QSD exists, it is unique and can be represented by a renewal-type formula. Multiple applications to the findings are presented, including revisiting some of the main classical results in the area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multiple extremal integrals as an extension of single extremal integrals, which have played important roles in extreme value theory. The multiple extremal integrals are formulated in terms of a product-form random sup measure derived from the $\alpha$-Fr\'{e}chet random sup measure. We establish a LePage-type representation similar to that used for multiple sum-stable integrals, which have been extensively studied in the literature. This approach allows us to investigate the integrability, tail behavior, and independence properties of multiple extremal integrals. Additionally, we discuss an extension of a recently proposed stationary model that exhibits an unusual extremal clustering phenomenon, now constructed using multiple extremal integrals.</description>

      <title>Hessian stability and convergence rates for entropic and Sinkhorn potentials via semiconcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we determine quantitative stability bounds for the Hessian of entropic potentials, \ie, the dual solution to the entropic optimal transport problem. To the authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this second-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our proof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on the representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward diffusion processes, known as Schr\"odinger bridges. Moreover, our approach allows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability estimates for entropic transport plans and for gradients of entropic potentials as well. Finally, as a direct consequence of these stability bounds, we deduce exponential convergence rates for gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a problem that was still open in unbounded settings. Our rates have a polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the Weingarten calculus employing the notion of virtual isometries. Traditionally, Weingarten calculus provides explicit formulas for integrating polynomial functions over compact matrix groups with respect to the Haar measure, yet faces limitations when evaluating high-degree integrals due to the non-invertibility of the associated matrices. We revisit these classical computations from a new perspective: by constructing Haar-distributed matrices via sequences of complex reflections, we derive new recursive structures for the Weingarten functions across different dimensions. This framework leads to two main results: (1) an explicit Weingarten calculus for complex reflections, yielding systematic moment computations for associated rank-one matrices, and (2) a novel convolution formula that connects Weingarten functions in dimension $n$ to those in dimension $n-1$ through the introduction of ascension functions in the symmetric group algebra. Our approach not only provides a unified treatment for unitary groups, but also sheds light on the algebraic and probabilistic aspects of high-degree integral computations. Several examples and applications are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1401.8052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The class of generating functions for completely monotone sequences (moments of finite positive measures on $[0,1]$) has an elegant characterization as the class of Pick functions analytic and positive on $(-\infty,1)$. We establish this and another such characterization and develop a variety of consequences. In particular, we characterize generating functions for moments of convex and concave probability distribution functions on $[0,1]$. Also we provide a simple analytic proof that for any real $p$ and $r$ with $p&gt;0$, the Fuss-Catalan or Raney numbers $\frac{r}{pn+r}\binom{pn+r}{n}$, $n=0,1,\ldots$ are the moments of a probability distribution on some interval $[0,\tau]$ {if and only if} $p\ge1$ and $p\ge r\ge 0$. The same statement holds for the binomial coefficients $\binom{pn+r-1}n$, $n=0,1,\ldots$. A corrigendum (Trans. Amer. Math.Soc., to appear) has been included as an appendix, correcting gaps in the proof of Lemma 3.</description>

      <title>Negative Dependence as a toolbox for machine learning : review and new developments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative dependence is becoming a key driver in advancing learning capabilities beyond the limits of traditional independence. Recent developments have evidenced support towards negatively dependent systems as a learning paradigm in a broad range of fundamental machine learning challenges including optimization, sampling, dimensionality reduction and sparse signal recovery, often surpassing the performance of current methods based on statistical independence. The most popular negatively dependent model has been that of determinantal point processes (DPPs), which have their origins in quantum theory. However, other models, such as perturbed lattice models, strongly Rayleigh measures, zeros of random functions have gained salience in various learning applications. In this article, we review this burgeoning field of research, as it has developed over the past two decades or so. We also present new results on applications of DPPs to the parsimonious representation of neural networks. In the limited scope of the article, we mostly focus on aspects of this area to which the authors contributed over the recent years, including applications to Monte Carlo methods, coresets and stochastic gradient descent, stochastic networks, signal processing and connections to quantum computation. However, starting from basics of negative dependence for the uninitiated reader, extensive references are provided to a broad swath of related developments which could not be covered within our limited scope. While existing works and reviews generally focus on specific negatively dependent models (e.g. DPPs), a notable feature of this article is that it addresses negative dependence as a machine learning methodology as a whole. In this vein, it covers within its span an array of negatively dependent models and their applications well beyond DPPs, thereby putting forward a very general and rather unique perspective.</description>

Abstract: We give a new proof that the empirical measures of the roots of Eulerian polynomials converge to a certain log-Cauchy distribution. To do so, we show that each moment of the roots of a related family of polynomials not only converge, but in fact become ultimately constant. These asymptotic moments are expressed in terms of Cauchy numbers of the second kind.</description>

      <title>Are Neural Networks Collision Resistant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We study the computational task of detecting and estimating correlated signals in a pair of spiked Wigner matrices. Our model consists of observations
  $$
  X = \tfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}} xx^{\top} + W \,, \quad Y = \tfrac{\mu}{\sqrt{n}} yy^{\top} + Z \,.
  $$
  where $x,y \in \mathbb R^n$ are signal vectors with norm $\|x\|,\|y\| \approx\sqrt{n}$ and correlation $\langle x,y \rangle \approx \rho\|x\|\|y\|$, while $W,Z$ are independent Gaussian Wigner matrices. We propose an efficient algorithm that succeeds whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)&gt;1$, where
  $$
  F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)=\max\Big\{ \lambda,\mu, \frac{ \lambda^2 \rho^2 }{ 1-\lambda^2+\lambda^2 \rho^2 } + \frac{ \mu^2 \rho^2 }{ 1-\mu^2+\mu^2 \rho^2 } \Big\} \,.
  $$
  Our result shows that an algorithm can leverage the correlation between the spikes to detect and estimate the signals even in regimes where efficiently recovering either $x$ from $X$ alone or $y$ from $Y$ alone is believed to be computationally infeasible.
  We complement our algorithmic result with evidence for a matching computational lower bound. In particular, we prove that when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)&lt;1$, all algorithms based on {\em low-degree polynomials} fails to distinguish $(X,Y)$ with two independent Wigner matrices. This low-degree analysis strongly suggests that $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)=1$ is the precise computation threshold for this problem.</description>
