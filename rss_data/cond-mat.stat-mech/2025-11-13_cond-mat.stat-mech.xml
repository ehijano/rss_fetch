      <title>Analytical Solution and Lie Algebra of the Relativistic Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel and more efficient approach to constructing the relativistic BKW (Bobylev, Krook, and Wu) solution. By introducing a class of ansatz functions for the distribution function, we demonstrate that within this specific ansatz space, only the equilibrium and BKW-type forms yield exact solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. Furthermore, guided by physical insight and drawing upon the framework of relativistic kinetic theory, we derive the Lie algebra of invariant transformations admitted by the relativistic Boltzmann equation. From this algebra, the corresponding symmetry group transformations can be systematically constructed.</description>

      <title>Universality and weak-ergodicity breaking in quantum quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sudden quenches in quantum many-body systems often lead to dynamical evolutions that unveil surprising physical behaviors. In this work, we argue that the emergence of weak ergodicity breaking following quantum quenches in certain local many-body systems is a direct consequence of lattice discretization. To support this claim, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum $O(n)$ models on a lattice. In doing so, we also revisit two puzzling results in the literature on quantum $O(n)$ models, concerning universal scaling and equilibration, and demonstrate how these apparent contradictions can be resolved by properly accounting for lattice effects.</description>

      <title>Complex Eigenvalues in a pseudo-Hermitian \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian PT-symmetric models have been extensively studied in recent years. Following the seminal work that reduced classical random matrix ensembles to a tridiagonal form, several efforts have aimed to generalize this framework to non-Hermitian extensions of the so-called \b{eta}-ensembles. In particular, while the transition of eigenvalues from the real axis to the complex plane has been well characterized for the \b{eta}-Hermite ensemble under symmetry breaking, the behavior of the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble in a similar non-Hermitian setting remains
  less understood. In this work, we investigate an ensemble of unstable matrices isospectral to the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble. Introducing a small non-Hermitian perturbation breaks the symmetry and drives the eigenvalues into the complex plane. We derive analytical expressions for the loci of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs, which organize into a balloon-like structure in the complex plane, followed by a discrete finite line of real eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of these eigenvalues is analyzed in the large matrix-size limit, and our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Modern Theory of Bose-Einstein Condensation, Superfluidity, and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern theory of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and superconductivity is reviewed. The thermodynamic principle for superfluid flow and the equation of motion for condensed bosons are given. Computer simulations of Lennard-Jones $^4$He give the $\lambda$-transition and the superfluid viscosity. The statistical mechanical theory of high-temperature superconductivity is presented. Critical comparison is made with older approaches, such as ground energy state condensation, irrotational superfluid flow, and the macroscopic wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Control and optimisation of irreversible processes in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is devoted to the study of physical systems embedded within the field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Specifically, the state of the systems of interest constitutes a stochastic process that can be externally driven by a set of controllable parameters. On the one hand, for systems in contact with a thermal bath, we have studied the emergence of strong memory effects and glassy behaviour upon varying the bath temperature, and how these are related to the existence of non-equilibrium attractors governing the dynamics. On the other hand, for overdamped harmonic systems, we have studied the problem of minimising the connection time between arbitrary stationary (either equilibrium or non-equilibrium) states, by suitably varying either the bath temperature or the stiffnesses of the potential.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility in stochastic systems by categorizing single-molecule displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the irreversibility and dissipation of non-equilibrium processes is crucial to understanding their behavior, assessing their possible capabilities, and characterizing their efficiency. We introduce a physical quantity that quantifies the irreversibility of stochastic Langevin systems from the observation of individual molecules' displacements. Categorizing these displacements into a few groups based on their initial and final position allows us to measure irreversibility precisely without the need to know the forces and magnitude of the fluctuations acting on the system. Our model-free estimate of irreversibility is related to entropy production by a conditional fluctuation theorem and provides a lower bound to the average entropy production. We validate the method on single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments of proteins subject to force ramps. We show that irreversibility is sensitive to detailed features of the energy landscape underlying the protein folding dynamics and suggest how our methods can be employed to unveil key properties of protein folding processes.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the DNLS equation at positive and negative absolute temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Discrete Non Linear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) model, due to the existence of two conserved quantities, displays an equilibrium transition between a homogeneous phase at positive absolute temperature and a localized phase at negative absolute temperature. Here, we provide a mean-field theory of DNLS and show that this approximation is semi-quantitatively correct in the whole phase diagram, becoming exact in proximity of the transition. Our mean-field theory shows that the passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states is smooth.</description>

      <title>Determining extended Markov parameterizations for vector-valued generalized Langevin Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Langevin equation is used as a model for various coarse-grained physical processes, e.g., the time evolution of the velocity of a given larger particle in an implicitly represented solvent, when the relevant time scales of the dynamics of the larger particle and the solvent particles are not strictly separated. Since this equation involves an integrated history of past velocities, considerable efforts have been made to approximate this dynamics by data-driven Markov models, where auxiliary variables are used to compensate for the memory term. In recent works we have developed two algorithms which can be used for this purpose, provided the dynamics in question are scalar processes. Here we extend these algorithms to vector-valued processes. As a physical test bed we consider an S-shaped particle sliding on a planar substrate, which gives rise to a truly two-dimensional velocity process. The two algorithms provide Markov approximations of this process with 10-20 auxiliary variables and a very accurate fit of the given autocorrelation data over the entire time interval where these data are non-negligible.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition in explosive percolation via local suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an explosive percolation model in which a link is randomly added and neighboring nodes sequentially rewire their links to suppress the growth of large clusters. In this manner, the rewiring nodes spread outward starting from the initial node closest to the added link. We show that a discontinuous transition emerges even when the total number of rewiring nodes after each link addition is finite. This finding implies that adding a link using the information of the cluster sizes attached to a finite set of link candidates (local information) can lead to a discontinuous transition if link rewiring is allowed. This result thus extends the previous result that a discontinuous transition arises only when a link is added using the information of the cluster sizes attached to an infinite number of link candidates (global information) in the absence of rewiring.</description>

      <title>Dynamic structure factor of a monatomic cubic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral function of density fluctuations, also known as the dynamic structure factor, of a monatomic cubic crystal with vacancies is derived from the macroscopic equations describing transport in crystalline solids. The resonances of the spectral function are identified as a Brillouin doublet of sound propagation, a central Rayleigh peak of heat diffusion, as for perfect crystals, and another central sharp peak associated with vacancy diffusion. Analytical expressions for the heat and vacancy diffusivities, speeds of sound, and sound damping coefficients are obtained. The theoretical results are compared to molecular dynamics simulations of a face-centered cubic crystal of hard spheres.</description>

      <title>Emergent long-tail dynamics in driven magnets with dynamical frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we show that dynamical frustration can spontaneously emerge in frustration-free magnetic systems under periodic driving. Specifically, we consider a classical spin system and demonstrate the emergence of spin-ice physics when drive-induced heating is well suppressed. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of magnetic monopole excitations, which, in sharp contrast to their equilibrium counterparts, exhibit a non-ergodic stochastic random-walk process with long-tailed, power-law distributed waiting times, where the power-law exponent is tunable by the system's effective temperature. Heating is accelerated at intermediate driving frequencies, and the system eventually heats up to an infinite-temperature state. However, the heating time is extremely sensitive to different initial-state realizations and also follows a long-tailed power-law distribution. We show that a drive-induced short-range attractive interaction between monopoles is responsible for the long-tailed distributions observed in both monopole and heating dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Cluster Tomography of Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical phase transitions have proven to be a powerful concept to capture the phenomenology of many systems, including deeply non-equilibrium ones like living systems. The study of these phase transitions has overwhelmingly relied on two-point correlation functions. In this Letter, we show that cluster tomography -- the study of one-dimensional cross-sections of the clusters that emerge near a phase transition -- is an alternative higher-order tool that efficiently locates and characterizes phase transitions in active systems. First, using motility-induced phase separation as a paradigmatic example, we show how complex geometric features of clusters, captured by spatial cluster tomography, can be used to measure critical exponents in active systems without explicitly introducing system-specific order parameters. Second, we introduce temporal cluster tomography, an analogous cluster-based measurement that characterizes the dynamical behavior of active systems. We show that cluster dynamics can be captured by a generalization of burstiness analysis in complex temporal networks. Both spatial and temporal cluster tomography are easy to implement yet powerful approaches to study non-equilibrium systems, making them useful additions to the standard toolbox of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Finite size scaling and edge effects in the Takayasu model of aggregation diffusion with input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study the effect of finite spatial boundaries on the Takayasu model of diffusing and aggregating particles with steady monomer input in one dimension. Exact expressions are derived for the steady-state density profile, two-point correlation functions, and mean-squared density under both open and periodic boundary conditions. The single-site mass distribution exhibits a crossover from a bulk power law $P(m)\sim m^{-4/3}$ to an edge power law $P(m)\sim m^{-5/3}$, occurring near the boundaries or the condensate that forms in periodic systems. The equivalence between the two boundary conditions is shown to break down in the case of multipoint probability distributions near the edge. The exact solution identifies a distinct boundary layer and shows that the edge anomaly arises when spatial mass currents, which scale as $\mathcal{O}(L)$, dominate over the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant flux in mass space. We further generalize these results to mass-dependent diffusion.</description>

      <title>Typicality of thermal states in isolated quantum systems corresponds to ubiquity of global minima in deep artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel theory theoretically guarantees the existence of a global minima of the cost function in the neighborhood of an arbitrary random initialization in deep artificial neural networks. In this paper, we show that the ubiquity of the global minima directly corresponds to the typicality of pure thermal states in isolated quantum systems by showing a common underlying mechanism, involving a few observables and the role of a Wishart-type matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the increase in distinguishability of the reduced density matrices of typical pure states with subsystem size corresponds to the double descent phenomenon observed by varying the width of layers in finite-width artificial neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-induced Quantum Hall Criticality in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that static disorder is indispensable to the integer quantum Hall effect, underpinning both quantized plateaus and the plateau-plateau transition. We show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, is sufficient to generate the same $\theta$ driven criticality. Starting from a Keldysh formulation, we derive an open system nonlinear $\sigma$ model (NL$\sigma$M) for class A with a topological $\theta$ term but no Cooperon sector, and we demonstrate that nonperturbative instantons still govern a two parameter flow of $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$. Evaluating $\theta$ in a dephasing quantum anomalous Hall setting, we predict a quantum Hall critical point at $\sigma_{xy}=1/2$ with finite $\sigma_{xx}$ the hallmark of the integer quantum Hall universality class realized without Anderson localization. Boundary driven simulations of the Qi_Wu_Zhang model with local dephasing confirm this prediction and provide an experimentally aligned protocol to extract $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$ from Hall potential maps. By establishing dephasing as a self contained route to Hall criticality, our framework reframes plateau physics in open solid state and cold atom platforms and offers practical diagnostics for topological transport in nonunitary matter.</description>

      <title>Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fractal structure of multipartite entanglement in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the distribution of multipartite entanglement in states produced in a one-dimensional random monitored quantum circuit where local Clifford unitaries are interspersed with single-site measurements performed with a probability $p$. This circuit has a measurement-induced phase transition at $p=p_c$, separating a phase in which the entanglement entropy scales with the system size (a volume law state) and one in which it scales with the boundary (an area law state). We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p &lt; p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \to 1$ in the area law phase. We explain this behavior by studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters. We find that the largest cluster of entangled qubits in these states has a fractal dimension between 0 and 1 and appears to be self-similar. Away from the critical point, this fractal dimension matches the entanglement depth power law exponent.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Socio-Economic Structure: A First-Principles Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between individual agent behavior and macroscopic societal patterns is a central challenge in the social sciences. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via a kinetic theory formulation. We demonstrate that complex, empirically-observed phenomena, such as the concentration of populations in cities and the emergence of power-law wealth distributions, can be derived directly from a microscopic model of agents governed by underdamped Langevin dynamics. Our multi-scale derivation yields the exact mesoscopic fluctuating (Dean-Kawasaki) dynamics and the macroscopic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system of equations. The analytical solution of this system reveals how a heterogeneous resource landscape alone is sufficient to generate the coupled structures of spatial and economic inequality, thus providing a formal link between micro-level stochasticity and macro-level deterministic order.</description>

      <title>Quantum Symmetry and Geometry in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.</description>

      <title>Information Processing in Quantum Thermodynamic Systems: an Autonomous Hamiltonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending the quantum formulation of [Phys. Rev. X 3, 041003 (2013)] to a more general setting for studying the thermodynamics of information processing including initial correlations, we generalize the second law of thermodynamics to account for information processing in such autonomous systems. We consider a composite quantum system consisting of a principal system, heat bath, memory, and work source, and adopt an autonomous Hamiltonian framework. We derive constraints on the total Hamiltonian that ensure the work source to act as a catalyst preserving its original randomness, namely that the total unitary evolution must have a unitary partial transpose. We show that this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of operators acting on the joint system of the principal system, bath, and memory, which underlies the Hamiltonian structure. Next, we generalize the quantum speed limit for the joint dynamics of system and memory to the quantum thermodynamic speed limit, from which we obtain a dynamical version of Landauer's bound. More importantly, we also interpret this quantum thermodynamic speed limit in the context of quantum hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Threshold model of language competition including the bilingual state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a threshold model of language competition which includes intermediate bilingual state. The model is based on the Minett-Wang model but through the introduction of thresholds in the language shift rates it incorporates the effects of memory and learning. The model is piecewise-linear, allowing the exact analytical treatment. We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.</description>

      <title>Finite-time trajectorial estimates for inhomogeneous random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider integer-valued random walks with independent but not identically distributed increments, and extend to this context several classical estimates, including a local limit theorem, precise small-ball estimates (both conditional on the final point and unconditional), and bounds on the probability that the random walk trajectory remains positive up to a given time (again, both conditional on the final point and unconditional). Two key features of this work are that the bounds are non-asymptotic, holding true for finite time horizons, and, crucially, that the latter hold uniformly over an entire class of admissible increment sequences. This provides a robust framework for applications. These results are, in particular, tailored for the analysis of processes derived through a time-dependent tilting of the increments of a time-homogeneous random walk.</description>

      <title>Random Walk conditioned to stay above a non-flat floor: curvature effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $h:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be $C^2$ and such that $\sup_{[0,1]} h''&lt;0$. For a (large) positive integer $n$, set $h_n(k) = n h(k/n)$ for any $k\in\{0,\dots,n\}$. We consider a random walk $(S_k)_{k\geq 0}$ with i.i.d.\ centred increments having some finite exponential moments. We are interested in the event $\{S\geq h_n\} = \{S_k\geq h_n(k)\;\forall k\in\{0,\dots,n\}\}$. It is well known that $P(S\geq h_n \,|\, S_0=0,\, S_n=\lceil h_n(n) \rceil) = e^{n\int_0^1 I(h'(s)) \,ds + o(n)}$, where $I$ is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment generating function associated to the increments. We first prove that the leading correction is of order $e^{-\Theta(n^{1/3})}$. We then turn our attention to the conditional random walk measure $P^h_n = P(\cdot \,|\, S\geq h_n, S_0=0, S_n=\lceil h_n(n) \rceil)$. We prove that the one-point tails are of the form $\mathbb{P}_n^h (S_k \geq h_n(k) + t n^{1/3} ) = e^{-\Theta(t^{3/2})}$ for all $t&lt;n^\beta$ for any $\beta\in (0,1/6)$. Moreover, we prove that, for any $r\geq 1$, $E_n^h((S_k-h_n(k))^r) = \Theta(n^{r/3})$ and $\mathrm{Var}_{P_n^h}(S_k) = \Theta(n^{2/3})$, for all $k$ far enough from $0$ and $n$. In addition, we show that $\mathrm{Cov}_{P_n^h}(S_k,S_\ell) \leq e^{-O(|\ell-k|/n^{2/3})}$ for all $k,\ell$ not too close to $0$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Behavior of a Sign-Problematic Model with Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sign-problematic generalized Baxter-Wu (GBW) model with asymmetric complex couplings is mapped onto a one-dimensional quantum model. Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit SWAP thermal machine -- a streamlined analogue of the four-stroke Otto cycle -- whose working medium comprises inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a thermal quantum field bath prepared at a different temperature. In the presence of relative motion between the working medium and the thermal baths, we derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) that quantify the trade-off between performance, entropy production, and power fluctuations. Our analysis identifies regimes where relativistic motion leads to stronger violation of classical TURs, previously observed in static quantum setups. In addition, we establish generalized performance bounds for the thermal machine operating as either a heat engine or a refrigerator, and discuss how relativistic motion can enhance their performances beyond the standard Carnot limits defined by rest-frame temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit gradient-based optimization for infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), a tensor network ansatz for simulating many-body quantum systems. This approach is hindered by two major challenges: the high computational cost of evaluating energies and gradients, and an ill-conditioned optimization landscape that slows convergence. To reduce the number of optimization steps, we introduce an efficient preconditioner derived from the leading term of the metric tensor. We benchmark our method against standard optimization techniques on the Heisenberg and Kitaev models, demonstrating substantial improvements in overall computational efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across various contraction schemes, unit cell sizes, and Hamiltonians, highlighting the potential of preconditioned optimization to advance tensor network algorithms for strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Jurgens and Crutchfield [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 104}, 064107 (2021), called ``paper III" in the following] computed what they called the ``ambiguity rate" of hidden Markov processes, a concept supposedly introduced by Claude Shannon. This calculation was based on a ``mixed state" formalism introduced by them in J. Stat. Phys. {\bf 183}, 32 (2021) (``paper I"), and developed further in Chaos, {\bf 31}, 083114 (2021) (``paper II"). We point out that (i) ambiguity rates were {\it not} introduced by Shannon; (ii) their computations in paper III are wrong, because of an error made already in papers I and II; (iii) due to this error (a confusion between open sets and their closures), also many of the ``statistical complexity dimensions" computed in II are wrong; (iv) the ``mixed state" formalism of I is just the well known `forward algorithm' for hidden Markov models; (v) the `causal states' in `$\epsilon$-machines' correspond in general to {\it finite} (as opposed to infinite, as often claimed) histories; and (vi) `$\epsilon$-machines' are always countable, in contrast to frequent claims in the literature. In addition, we propose an alternative complexity measure for models where the forecasting complexity is infinite, and we point out that our results apply also beyond hidden Markov models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>

      <title>Correlated quantum machines beyond the standard second law</title>

Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics strongly restrict the performance of thermal machines. Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and a novel athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Universal Behavior in Entanglement Entropy Reveals Quantum Criticality and Underlying Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09942v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a key role in quantum physics, but how much information it can extract from many-body systems is still an open question, particularly regarding quantum criticalities and emergent symmetries. In this work, we systematically study the entanglement entropy (EE) and derivative entanglement entropy (DEE) near quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. A one-parameter scaling relation between the DEE and system size at the critical point has been derived for the first time, which successfully obtains the critical exponent via data collapse. Furthermore, we find that the EE peaks at the (emergent) symmetry enhanced first-order transition, reflecting higher symmetry breaking. This work provides a new paradigm for quantum many-body research from the perspective of EE and DEE.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>

      <title>Deep-lying semi-Dirac fermions in hexagonal close-packed cadmium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11585v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands anti-crossing at $-3$ eV below the Fermi level in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed cadmium. The linear out-of-plane dispersion is kept up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>Does the square-root price impact law belong to the strict universal scalings?: quantitative support by a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in three-dimensional (3D) Rydberg arrays, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal weight superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single-mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Learning conformational ensembles of proteins based on backbone geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry - BBFlow. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy, is transferable to multi-chain proteins, and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce or absent. BBFlow is available at https://github.com/graeter-group/bbflow.</description>

      <title>Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</description>

      <title>Quantum-to-Classical Transition via Single-Shot Generalized Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum-to-classical transition in finite-dimensional systems is generally believed to occur asymptotically, yet this process has not been systematically examined and the mechanism governing the intermediate regime remains unclear. We address this question using an operational framework that bridges discrete generalized measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing channels. We show that a single round of such a generalized measurement can eliminate quasiprobability negativity, that is, nonclassicality, in quantum phase space for finite-dimensional systems. From the perspective of decoherence, we find that although the overall process is continuous, the loss of quasiprobability negativity occurs abruptly, defying the conventional expectation of asymptotic decay. Additionally, we propose quantum-circuit implementations and analyze their feasibility on current quantum platforms, such as superconducting systems. Our results provide new insight into the intermediate regime of the quantum-to-classical transition in finite-dimensional systems and enable the simulation of open system dynamics through operational generalized measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis demonstrate that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model: it exhibits a memory capacity that grows linearly with connectivity, a persistent spectral gap separating stored patterns from noise, and significantly enlarged basins of attraction. These results show that geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure yield associative memories with markedly enhanced stability and retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same solution of the gap equation studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760753$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</description>

      <title>Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, the Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropies are shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $(-1)^F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When an unpaired Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.</description>

Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19902</link>

Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link>

Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description>
