      <title>MHD modeling of a geoeffective interplanetary CME with the magnetic topology informed by in-situ observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variations of the magnetic field within solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the heliosphere depend on the CME`s magnetic structure as it leaves the solar corona and its subsequent evolution through interplanetary space. To account for this evolution, we developed a new numerical model of the inner heliosphere that simulates the propagation of a CME through a realistic background solar wind and allows various CME magnetic topologies. To this end, we incorporate the Gibson-Low CME model within our global MHD model of the inner heliosphere, GAMERA-Helio. We apply the model to study the propagation of the geoeffective CME that erupted on 3 April, 2010 with the aim to reproduce the temporal variations of the magnetic field vector during the CME passage by Earth. Parameters of the Gibson-Low CME are informed by STEREO white-light observations near the Sun. The magnetic topology for this CME - the tethered flux rope - is informed by in-situ magnetic field observations near Earth. We performed two simulations testing different CME propagation directions. For an in-ecliptic direction, the simulation shows a rotation of all three magnetic field components within the CME, as seen at Earth, similar to that observed. With a southward propagation direction, suggested by coronal imaging observations, the modeled By and Bz components are consistent with the ACE data, but the Bx component lacks the observed change from negative to positive. In both cases, the model favors the East-West orientation of the CME flux rope, consistent with the orientation previously inferred from the STEREO/HI heliospheric images.</description>

      <title>Theia 456: Tidally Shredding an Open Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of clustering algorithms to the Gaia astrometric catalog has revolutionized our census of stellar populations in the Milky Way, including the discovery of many new, dispersed structures. We focus on one such structure, Theia 456 (COIN-Gaia-13), a loosely bound collection of ~320 stars spanning ~120 pc that has previously been shown to exhibit kinematic, chemical, and gyrochronal coherency, indicating a common origin. We obtain follow-up radial velocities and supplement these with Gaia astrometry to perform an in-depth dynamical analysis of Theia 456. By integrating stellar orbits through a Milky Way potential, we find the currently dispersed structure coalesced into a small cluster in the past. Via Bayesian modeling, we derive a kinematic age of 245 +/- 3 Myr (statistical), a half-mass radius of 9 +/- 2 pc, and an initial velocity dispersion of 0.14 +/- 0.02 km/s. Our results are entirely independent of model isochrones, details of stellar evolution, and internal cluster dynamics, and the statistical precision in our age derivation rivals that of the most precise age-dating techniques known today, though our imperfect knowledge of the Milky Way potential and simple spherical model for Theia 456 at birth add additional uncertainties. Using posterior predictive checking, we confirm these results are robust under reasonable variations to the Milky Way potential. Such low density structures that are disrupted by the Galactic tides before virializing may be ubiquitous, signifying that Theia 456 is a valuable benchmark for studying the dynamical history of stellar populations in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Observation of a large-scale filament eruption initiated by two small-scale erupting filaments pushing out from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filament eruptions often result in flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most studies attribute the filament eruptions to their instabilities or magnetic reconnection. In this study, we report a unique observation of a filament eruption whose initiation process has not been reported before. This large-scale filament, with a length of about 360 Mm crossing an active region, is forced to erupted by two small-scale erupting filaments pushing out from below. This process of multi-filament eruption results in an M6.4 flare in the active region NOAA 13229 on 25th February 2023. The whole process can be divided into three stages: the eruptions of two active-region filaments F1 and F2; the interactions between the erupting F1, F2, and the large-scale filament F3; and the eruption of F3. Though this multi-filament eruption occurs near the northwest limb of the solar disk, it produces a strong halo CME that causes a significant geomagnetic disturbance. Our observations present a new filament eruption mechanism, in which the initial kinetic energy of the eruption is obtained from and transported to by other erupting structures. This event provides us a unique insight into the dynamics of multi-filament eruptions and their corresponding effects on the interplanetary space.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Photometric Study of RR Lyrae Variables in the Globular Cluster NGC 5272 (Messier 3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric study of RR Lyrae stars in the M3 globular cluster, utilising a vast dataset of 3140 optical ($UBVRI$) CCD images spanning 35 years from astronomical data archives. We have successfully identified previously known 238 RR Lyrae stars from the photometric data, comprising 178 RRab, 49 RRc, and 11 RRd stars. Multi-band periodogram was used to significantly improve the long-term periods of $65\%$ of RR Lyrae stars in our sample, thanks to the unprecedentedly long temporal coverage of the observations. The light curve templates were used to obtain accurate and precise mean magnitudes and amplitudes of all RR Lyrae variables. We combined optical ($UBVRI$) and near-infrared (NIR, $JHK_{s}$) photometry of RR Lyrae variables to investigate their location in the colour-magnitude diagrams as well as the pulsation properties such as period distributions, Bailey diagrams and amplitude ratios. The Period-Luminosity relations in $R$ and $I$ bands and Period-Wesenheit relations were derived after excluding outliers identified in CMDs. The Period-Wesenheit relations calibrated via the theoretically predicted relations were used to determine a distance modulus of $\mu = 15.04 \pm 0.04 \,{\rm (stats)} \pm 0.19 \,{\rm {(syst.)}}$ mag (using metal-independent $W_{BV}$ Wesenheit) and $\mu = 15.03 \pm 0.04 \,{\rm (stats)} \pm 0.17 \,{\rm {(syst.)}}$ mag (using metal-dependent $W_{VI}$ Wesenheit). Our distance measurements are in excellent agreement with published distances to M3 in the literature. We also employed an artificial neural network based comparison of theoretical and observed light curves to determine physical parameters (mass, luminosity, and effective temperature) for $79$ non-Blazhko RRab stars that agree with limited literature measurements.</description>

      <title>A distinct halo population revealed from 3D non-LTE magnesium abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium is one of the important elements in stellar physics as an electron donor and in Galactic Archaeology as a discriminator of different stellar populations. However, previous studies of Mg I and Mg II lines in metal-poor benchmark stars have flagged problems with magnesium abundances inferred from one-dimensional (1D), hydrostatic models of stellar atmospheres, both with or without the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation. We here present 3D non-LTE calculations for magnesium in FG-type dwarfs, and provide corrections for 1D LTE abundances. The 3D non-LTE corrections reduce the ionisation imbalances in the benchmark metal-poor stars HD84937 and HD140283 from $-0.16$ dex and $-0.27$ dex in 1D LTE, to just $-0.02$ dex and $-0.09$ dex respectively. We then applied our abundance corrections to 1D LTE literature results for stars in the thin disc, thick disc, $\alpha$-rich halo, and $\alpha$-poor halo. We find that the 3D non-LTE results show a richer substructure in [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] in the $\alpha$-poor halo, revealing two subpopulations at the metal-rich end. These two subpopulations are also separated in kinematics, supporting the astrophysical origin of the separation. While the more magnesium-poor subpopulation is likely to be debris from a massive accreted galaxy, Gaia-Enceladus, the other subpopulation may be related to a previous identified group of stars, called Eos. The presence of additional separation in [Mg/Fe] suggests that previous Mg abundance measurements may have been limited in the precision by the 1D and LTE approximations, highlighting the importance of 3D non-LTE modelling.</description>

      <title>Orbital Period Variation Analysis of the HS 0705+6700 Post-Common Envelope Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To detect additional bodies in binary systems, we performed a potent approach of orbital period variation analysis. In this work, we present 90 new mid-eclipse times of a short-period eclipsing binary system. Observations were made using two telescopes from 2014 to 2024, extending the time span of the O-C diagram to 24 years. The data obtained in the last seven years indicate significant deviations in the O-C diagram from the models obtained in previous studies. We investigated whether this variation could be explained by mechanisms such as the LTT effect or Applegate. To investigate the cyclic behaviour observed in the system with the LTT effect, we modelled the updated O-C diagram using different models including linear/quadratic terms and additional bodies. The updated O-C diagram is statistically consistent with the most plausible solutions of models that include multiple brown dwarfs close to each other. However, it has been found that the orbit of the system is unstable on short time scales. Using three different theoretical definitions, we have found that the Applegate mechanism cannot explain the variation in the orbital period except for the model containing the fifth body. Therefore, due to the complex nature of the system, further mid-eclipse time is required before any conclusions can be drawn about the existence of additional bodies.</description>

      <title>Sun-as-a-star observations of obscuration dimmings caused by filament eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filament eruptions often lead to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the Sun and are one of the most energetic eruptive phenomena in the atmospheres of other late-type stars. However, the detection of filament eruptions and CMEs on stars beyond the solar system is challenging. Here we present six filament eruption cases on the Sun and show that filament material obscuring part of the solar disk can cause detectable dimming signatures in sun-as-a-star flux curves of He II 304 A. Those filament eruptions have similar morphological features, originating from small filaments inside active regions and subsequently strongly expanding to obscure large areas of the solar disk or the bright flare regions. We have tracked the detailed evolution of six obscuration dimmings and estimated the dimming properties, such as dimming depths, dimming areas, and duration. The largest dimming depth among the six events under study is 6.2% accompanied by the largest dimming area of 5.6\% of the solar disk area. Other events have maximum dimming depths in a range of around 1% to 3% with maximum areas varying between about 3% to 4% of the solar disk area. The duration of the dimming spans from around 0.4 hours to 7.0 hours for the six events under study. A positive correlation was found between the dimming depth and area, which may help to set constraint on the filament sizes in stellar observations.</description>

      <title>The variation in the response of solar full-disc magnetographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compared magnetograms from the KPVT/SPM, SoHO/MDI, SOLIS/VSM, and SDO/HMI with the aim of probing the effect on measured solar magnetism of the variation in instrument response with time, magnetogram signal level, and position on the solar disc. Taking near-simultaneous observations from the various instruments, we examined the surface coverage by magnetic activity and the effect of cross-calibrating the various instruments under different assumptions. By comparing the surface coverage by magnetic activity in the observations from the various instruments, we traced the effect of the time variation in instrument response on the longitudinal magnetogram signal and disc-integrated unsigned magnetic flux. This yielded evidence of acute changes in the response of MDI and VSM with certain events such as the SoHO vacation in 1998 and the upgrade of the VSM CCD camera in 2009. Excluding these changes, the effect of instrument instability on the magnetogram signal and disc-integrated magnetic flux appears to be rather benign, with an associated uncertainty of less than 2%. We determined the magnetogram signal ratio between each instrument pairing as a function of magnetogram signal level and distance from disc centre and with it cross-calibrated the various instruments. We compared the result with that from repeating the cross-calibration with the overall magnetogram signal ratio. This allowed us to estimate the uncertainty in the magnetogram signal associated with the variation in instrument response with magnetogram signal level and distance from disc centre to be about 8% to 14%. The corresponding uncertainty in the disc-integrated magnetic flux is about 7% to 23 %. The results here will be useful to the interpretation of SPM, MDI, VSM, and HMI magnetograms. As examples, we applied our findings to selected results from earlier studies based on such data.</description>

      <title>The Sun's Non-Potential Corona over Solar Cycle 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global magnetic field in the solar corona is known to contain free magnetic energy and magnetic helicity above that of a current-free (potential) state. But the strength of this non-potentiality and its evolution over the solar cycle remain uncertain. Here we model the corona over Solar Cycle 24 using a simplified magneto-frictional model that retains the magnetohydrodynamic induction equation but assumes relaxation towards force-free equilibrium, driven by solar surface motions and flux emergence. The model is relatively conservative compared to some others in the literature, with free energy approximately 20-25% of the potential field energy. We find that unsigned helicity is about a factor 10 higher at Maximum than Minimum, while free magnetic energy shows an even greater increase. The cycle averages of these two quantities are linearly correlated, extending a result found previously for active regions. Also, we propose a practical measure of eruptivity for these simulations, and show that this increases concurrently with the sunspot number, in accordance with observed coronal mass ejection rates. Whilst shearing by surface motions generates 50% or more of the free energy and helicity in the corona, we show that active regions must emerge with their own internal helicity otherwise the eruptivity is substantially reduced and follows the wrong pattern over time.</description>

      <title>X-ray and UV radiation in the planet-forming T-Tauri system PDS 70. Signs of accretion and coronal activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation takes place in protoplanetary discs around young T-Tauri stars. PDS 70 is one of the first confirmed examples of a system where the planets are currently forming in gaps in the disc, and can be directly imaged. One of the main early influences on planet formation is the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk, which is limited by the intense stellar X-ray and UV radiation. Stellar coronal activity and accretion of material onto the star are both potential sources of XUV radiation. Previous \textit{Swift} observations detected UV emission, which were consistent with a low rate of accretion. We present follow up observations with the XMM-Newton observatory, which observed PDS 70 simultaneously in X-ray and UV in order to determine intensity of XUV radiation in the system, and identify if the source is coronal, accretion, or both. We detect a strong source in both X-ray and UV, with an average X-ray 0.2-12 keV luminosity of $1.37\times10^{30}\ \mathrm{erg\ s}^{-1}$, and a possible flare which increased the luminosity to $2.8\times10^{30}\ \mathrm{erg\ s}^{-1}$. The UV flux density is in excess of what would be expected from chromospheric emission, and supports the interpretation that PDS 70 has continuing weak accretion less than $\sim10^{-10}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}}$. The implications of the detected X-ray and UV radiation are that the disc is likely to be in the final stages of dispersal, and will be completely evaporated in the next million years, bringing an end to the primary planet formation process.</description>

      <title>Extreme Solar Flare Prediction Using Residual Networks with HMI Magnetograms and Intensitygrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares, especially C, M, and X class, pose significant risks to satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids. We present a novel approach for predicting extreme solar flares using HMI intensitygrams and magnetograms. By detecting sunspots from intensitygrams and extracting magnetic field patches from magnetograms, we train a Residual Network (ResNet) to classify extreme class flares. Our model demonstrates high accuracy, offering a robust tool for predicting extreme solar flares and improving space weather forecasting. Additionally, we show that HMI magnetograms provide more useful data for deep learning compared to other SDO AIA images by better capturing features critical for predicting flare magnitudes. This study underscores the importance of identifying magnetic fields in solar flare prediction, marking a significant advancement in solar activity prediction with practical implications for mitigating space weather impacts.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey -- XXVI. The very metal-poor Galaxy: Chemodynamics through the follow-up of the Pristine-Gaia synthetic catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pristine-\textit{Gaia} synthetic catalogue provides reliable photometric metallicities for $\sim$30 million FGK stars using the Pristine survey model and Gaia XP spectra. We perform the first low-to-medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of bright (G&lt;15) and distant (up to 35 kpc) very and extremely metal-poor (V/EMP, [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5) red giant branch stars from this. We use Isaac Newton Telescope/Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (INT/IDS) observations centred around the calcium triplet region ideal for V/EMP stars. We find that 76\% of our stars indeed have [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5 with these inferred spectroscopic metallicities and only 3\% are outliers with [Fe/H] &gt; -2.0. We report a success rate of 77\% and 38\% in finding stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5 and -3.0 respectively. This will allow for 10,000-20,000 homogeneously analysed EMP stars using the WEAVE survey follow-up of Pristine EMP candidates. We associate 20\%, 46\%, and 34\% of the stars to be confined to the disc plane, or to have inner and outer halo orbits, respectively. We also associate these V/EMP stars to known accretion events such as Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), LMS-1/Wukong, Thamnos, Helmi streams, Sagittarius, Sequoia, etc. For the stars that orbit close to the disc plane, we find that the prograde region with low vertical action is overdense with a significance of 4$\sigma$ as compared to its retrograde counterpart. We also find three new (brightest) members of the most metal-poor stellar stream, C-19, one of which is 50$^\circ$ away from the main body of the stream. Our measured mean metallicity, velocity dispersion, and stream width are consistent with the literature, but our results favour a higher distance ($\sim$21.5 kpc) for the stream. We publish a catalogue (and 1D spectra) of 215 V/EMP stars from this spectroscopic follow-up and showcase the power of chemokinematic analysis of V/EMP end.</description>

      <title>Are these planets or brown dwarfs? Broadly solar compositions from high-resolution atmospheric retrievals of ~10-30 $M_\textrm{Jup}$ companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution ($R$~35000) spectroscopy from 2.29-2.49 $\mu$m, we present uniform atmospheric retrievals for eight young substellar companions with masses of ~10-30 $M_\textrm{Jup}$, orbital separations spanning ~50-360 au, and $T_\textrm{eff}$ between ~1500-2600 K. We find that all companions have solar C/O ratios, and metallicities, to within the 1-2$\sigma$ level, with the measurements clustered around solar composition. Stars in the same stellar associations as our systems have near-solar abundances, so these results indicate that this population of companions is consistent with formation via direct gravitational collapse. Alternatively, core accretion outside the CO snowline would be compatible with our measurements, though the high mass ratios of most systems would require rapid core assembly and gas accretion in massive disks. On a population level, our findings can be contrasted with abundance measurements for directly imaged planets with m&lt;10 $M_\textrm{Jup}$, which show tentative atmospheric metal enrichment. In addition, the atmospheric compositions of our sample of companions are distinct from those of hot Jupiters, which most likely form via core accretion. For two companions with $T_\textrm{eff}$~1700-2000 K (kap And b and GSC 6214-210 b), our best-fit models prefer a non-gray cloud model with &gt;3$\sigma$ significance. The cloudy models yield 2-3$\sigma$ lower $T_\textrm{eff}$ for these companions, though the C/O and [C/H] still agree between cloudy and clear models at the $1\sigma$ level. Finally, we constrain 12CO/13CO for three companions with the highest S/N data (GQ Lup b, HIP 79098 b, and DH Tau b), and report $v$sin($i$) and radial velocities for all companions.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing Matter through a Long-Range Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a long-range force, mediated by an ultralight scalar, which can give rise to violation of baryon number. This would lead to very different lifetimes for nucleons in different astrophysical environments. Possible signals of this scenario include a flux of O(10 MeV) solar neutrinos or anomalous heating of old neutron stars; we find the latter to yield the strongest current bounds, which could be improved in the coming years. The ultralight scalar employed here can potentially be a good dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- A glance at free-floating new-born planets in the sigma Orionis cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an early assessment of the imaging capabilities of the Euclid space mission to probe deeply into nearby star-forming regions and associated very young open clusters, and in particular to check to what extent it can shed light on the new-born free-floating planet population. This paper focuses on a low-reddening region observed in just one Euclid pointing where the dust and gas has been cleared out by the hot sigma Orionis star. One late-M and six known spectroscopically confirmed L-type substellar members in the sigma Orionis cluster are used as benchmarks to provide a high-purity procedure to select new candidate members with Euclid. The exquisite angular resolution and depth delivered by the Euclid instruments allow us to focus on bona-fide point sources. A cleaned sample of sigma Orionis cluster substellar members has been produced and the initial mass function (IMF) has been estimated by combining Euclid and Gaia data. Our sigma Orionis substellar IMF is consistent with a power-law distribution with no significant steepening at the planetary-mass end. No evidence of a low-mass cutoff is found down to about 4 Jupiter masses at the young age (3 Myr) of the sigma Orionis open cluster.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: the low-energy explosion of an ultra-stripped star, with non-radioactive heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stripped envelope supernova progenitors are formed through binary interaction, losing hydrogen and/or helium from their outer layers. An emerging class of supernovae with the highest degree of envelope-stripping are thought to be the product of stripping by a NS companion. However, relatively few examples are known and the outcomes of such systems can be diverse and are poorly understood at present. Here, we present spectroscopic observations and high cadence multi-band photometry of SN 2023zaw, a low ejecta mass and rapidly evolving supernova. SN 2023zaw was discovered in a nearby spiral galaxy at D = 39.7 Mpc, with significant Milky Way extinction, $E(B-V) = 0.21$, and significant (but uncertain) host extinction. Bayesian evidence comparison reveals that nickel is not the only power source and an additional energy source is required to explain our observations. Our models suggest an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.07\,\rm M_\odot$ and a synthesised nickel mass of $M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.007\,\rm M_\odot$ is required to explain the explosion. However an additional heating from a magnetar or interaction with circumstellar material is required to power the early light curve.</description>

      <title>A Joint X-ray and Optical Study of the Massive Redback Pulsar J2215+5135</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PSR J2215+5135 (J2215) is a `redback' spider pulsar, where the intrabinary shock (IBS) wraps around the pulsar rather than the stellar-mass companion. Spider orbital light curves are modulated, dominated by their binary companion thermal emission in the optical band and by IBS synchrotron emission in the X-rays. We report on new XMM-Newton X-ray and U-band observations of J2215. We produce orbital light curves and use them to model the system properties. From our optical light curve modeling, we find a neutron star mass $M_{NS}=2.15\pm0.10 M_\odot$, somewhat lower than previously reported. From the X-ray analysis, we find that the IBS still wraps around the pulsar, but with a wind/companion wind momenta ratio unusually close to unity, implying a flatter IBS geometry {than seen in other spiders. Estimating the companion wind momentum and speed from the X-ray light curve, we find a companion mass-loss rate of ${\dot M}_c\gtrsim10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, so that J2215 may become an isolated millisecond pulsar in $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our X-ray analyses support models of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the highly magnetized relativistic IBS.</description>

      <title>Full spectroscopic model and trihybrid experimental-perturbative-variational line list for NH</title>

Abstract: Imidogen (NH) is a reactive molecule whose presence in astrochemical environments is of interest due to its role in the formation of nitrogen-containing molecules and as a potential probe of nitrogen abundance. Spectroscopic NH monitoring is useful for Earth-based combustion and photolysis processes of ammonia and other nitrogen-containing species. NH is also relevant to ultracold molecular physics and plasma studies. To enable these diverse applications, high-quality molecular spectroscopic data is required. Here, a new line list with significant advantages over existing data is presented. Most notably, this line list models isotopologue spectroscopy and forbidden transitions (important for NH visible absorption), alongside some overall improvements to accuracy and completeness. This approach takes advantage of existing experimental data (from a previous MARVEL compilation) and perturbative line lists together with new MRCI ab initio electronic data. These are used to produce a novel variational spectroscopic model and trihybrid line list for the main 14N1H isotopologue, as well as isotopologue-extrapolated hybrid line lists for the 14N2H, 15N1H and 15N2H isotopologues. The new 14N1H ExoMol-style trihybrid line list, kNigHt, comprises 4,076 energy levels (1,078 experimental) and 327,014 transitions up to 47,500 cm-1 (211 nm) between five low-lying electronic states (X 3{\Sigma}-, a 1{\Delta}, b 1{\Sigma}+, A 3{\Pi} and c 1{\Pi}). For most anticipated applications aside from far-IR studies, this line list will be of sufficient quality; any improvements should focus on the b 1{\Sigma}+ energies, and the a 1{\Delta} - A 3{\Pi} and b 1{\Sigma}+ - A 3{\Pi} spin-orbit couplings.</description>

      <title>The time-variable ultraviolet sky: Active Galactic Nuclei, Stars and White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we present the 1UVA catalog of time variable ultraviolet (UV) sources. We describe a new analysis pipeline, the VAriable Source Clustering Analysis (VASCA). We apply the pipeline to 10 years of data from the GALaxy Evolution eXplorer (GALEX) satellite. We analyse a sky area of 302 deg$^2$ , resulting in the detection of 4202 time-variable UV sources. We cross correlate these sources with multi-frequency data from the Gaia satellite and the SIMBAD database, finding an association for 3655 sources. The source sample is dominated by Active Galactic Nuclei ($\approx$73 %) and stars ($\approx$24 %). We look at UV and multi-frequency properties of these sources, focusing on the stellar population. We find UV variability for four White Dwarfs. One of them, WD J004917.14-252556.81, has recently been found to be the most massive pulsating White Dwarf. Its Spectral Energy Distribution shows no sign of a stellar companion. The observed flux variability is unexpected and difficult to explain.</description>

      <title>Compressible turbulent convection: The role of temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of variable material properties, such as temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and dynamical viscosity, on the dynamics of a fully compressible turbulent convection flow beyond the anelastic limit are studied in the present work by two series of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations in a layer of aspect ratio 4 with periodic boundary conditions in both horizontal directions. One simulation series is for a weakly stratified adiabatic background, one for a strongly stratified one. The Rayleigh number is $10^5$ and the Prandtl number is 0.7 throughout this study. The temperature dependence of material parameters is imposed as a power law with an exponent $\beta$. It generates a superadiabaticity $\varepsilon(z)$ that varies across the convection layer. Central statistical quantities of the flow, such as the mean superadiabatic temperature, temperature and density fluctuations, or turbulent Mach numbers are compared in the form of horizontal plane-time averaged profiles. It is found that the additional material parameter dependence causes systematic quantitative changes of all these quantities, but no qualitative ones. A growing temperature power law exponent $\beta$ also enhances the turbulent momentum transfer in the weak stratification case by 40\%, it reduces the turbulent heat transfer by up to 50\% in the strong stratification case.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis Models Indicate a Need for Early and Ubiquitous Disk Substructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large mm surveys of star forming regions enable the study of entire populations of planet-forming disks and reveal correlations between their observable properties. Population studies of disks have shown that the correlation between disk size and millimeter flux could be explained either through disks with strong substructure, or alternatively by the effects of radial inward drift of growing dust particles. This study aims to constrain the parameters and initial conditions of planet-forming disks and address the question of the need for the presence of substructures in disks and, if needed, their predicted characteristics, based on the large samples of disk sizes, millimeter fluxes, and spectral indices available. We performed a population synthesis of the continuum emission of disks, exploiting a two-population model (two-pop-py), considering the influence of viscous evolution, dust growth, fragmentation, and transport varying the initial conditions of the disk and substructure to find the best match to the observed distributions. We show that the observed distributions of spectral indices, sizes, and luminosities together can be best reproduced by disks with significant substructure, namely a perturbation strong enough to be able to trap particles, and that is formed early in the evolution of the disk, that is within 0.4Myr. Agreement is reached by relatively high initial disk masses ($10^{-2.3}M_{\star}\leqslant M_{disk}\leqslant10^{-0.5}M_{\star}$) and moderate levels of turbulence ($10^{-3.5}\leqslant\alpha\leqslant 10^{-2.5}$). Other disk parameters play a weaker role. Only opacities with high absorption efficiency can reproduce the observed spectral indices. Our results extend to the whole population that substructure is likely ubiquitous, so far assessed only in individual disks and implies that most "smooth" disks hide unresolved substructure.</description>

      <title>WTP19aalnxx: Discovery of a bright mid-infrared transient in the emerging class of low luminosity supernovae revealed by delayed circumstellar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While core-collapse supernovae (SNe) often show early and consistent signs of circumstellar (CSM) interaction, some exhibit delayed signatures due to interaction with distant material around the progenitor star. Here we present the discovery in NEOWISE data of WTP19aalnxx, a luminous mid-infrared (IR) transient in the outskirts of the galaxy KUG 0022-007 at $\approx 190$ Mpc. First detected in 2018, WTP19aalnxx reaches a peak absolute (Vega) magnitude of $\approx-22$ at $4.6 \, \mu$m in $\approx3$ yr, comparable to the most luminous interacting SNe. Archival data reveal a $\gtrsim 5\times$ fainter optical counterpart detected since 2015, while follow-up near-IR observations in 2022 reveal an extremely red ($Ks-W2 \approx 3.7$ mag) active transient. Deep optical spectroscopy confirm strong CSM interaction signatures via intermediate-width Balmer emission lines and coronal metal lines. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution, we estimate the presence of $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ of warm dust, likely formed in the shock interaction region. Together with the lack of nebular Fe emission, we suggest that WTP19aalnxx is a missed, low (optical) luminosity SN in an emerging family of core-collapse SNe distinguished by their CSM-interaction-powered mid-IR emission that outshines the optical bands. Investigating the Zwicky Transient Facility sample of SNe in NEOWISE data, we find $17$ core-collapse SNe ($\gtrsim 3$% in a volume-limited sample) without early signs of CSM interaction that exhibit delayed IR brightening, suggestive of dense CSM shells at $\lesssim 10^{17}$cm. We suggest that synoptic IR surveys offer a new route to revealing late-time CSM interaction and the prevalence of intense terminal mass loss in massive stars.</description>

      <title>Gliese 12 b: A temperate Earth-sized planet at 12 pc ideal for atmospheric transmission spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of Earth-sized planets transiting nearby M dwarfs have made it possible to characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial planets via follow-up spectroscopic observations. However, the number of such planets receiving low insolation is still small, limiting our ability to understand the diversity of the atmospheric composition and climates of temperate terrestrial planets. We report the discovery of an Earth-sized planet transiting the nearby (12 pc) inactive M3.0 dwarf Gliese 12 (TOI-6251) with an orbital period ($P_{\rm{orb}}$) of 12.76 days. The planet, Gliese 12b, was initially identified as a candidate with an ambiguous $P_{\rm{orb}}$ from TESS data. We confirmed the transit signal and $P_{\rm{orb}}$ using ground-based photometry with MuSCAT2 and MuSCAT3, and validated the planetary nature of the signal using high-resolution images from Gemini/NIRI and Keck/NIRC2 as well as radial velocity (RV) measurements from the InfraRed Doppler instrument on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope and from CARMENES on the CAHA 3.5 m telescope. X-ray observations with XMM-Newton showed the host star is inactive, with an X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratio of $\log L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol} \approx -5.7$. Joint analysis of the light curves and RV measurements revealed that Gliese 12b has a radius of 0.96 $\pm$ 0.05 $R_\oplus$, a 3$\sigma$ mass upper limit of 3.9 $M_\oplus$, and an equilibrium temperature of 315 $\pm$ 6 K assuming zero albedo. The transmission spectroscopy metric (TSM) value of Gliese 12b is close to the TSM values of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, adding Gliese 12b to the small list of potentially terrestrial, temperate planets amenable to atmospheric characterization with JWST.</description>

      <title>Zero and extremely low metallicity rotating massive stars: evolution, explosion, and nucleosynthesis up to the heaviest nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the evolution and the explosion of two massive stars, 15 and 25 M$_{\odot}$, spanning a wide range of initial rotation velocities (from 0 to 800 km/s) and three initial metallicities: Z=0 ([Fe/H]=$-\infty$), $3.236\times10^{-7}$ ([Fe/H]=-5), and $3.236\times10^{-6}$ ([Fe/H]=-4). A very large nuclear network of 524 nuclear species extending up to Bi has been adopted. Our main findings may be summarized as follows: a) rotating models above Z=0 are able to produce nuclei up to the neutron closure shell at N=50, and in a few cases up to N=82; b) rotation drastically inhibits the penetration of the He convective shell in the H rich mantle, phenomenon often found in zero metallicity non rotating massive stars; c) vice versa rotation favors the penetration of the O convective shell in the C rich layers with the consequence of altering significantly the yields of the products of the C, Ne, and O burning; d) none of the models that reach the critical velocity while in H burning, loses more the 1 M$_{\odot}$ in this phase; e) conversely, almost all models able to reach their Hayashi track exceed the Eddington luminosity and lose dynamically almost all their H rich mantle.
  These models suggest that rotating massive stars may have contributed significantly to the synthesis of the heavy nuclei in the first phase of enrichment of the interstellar medium, i.e., at early times.</description>

Abstract: In the hunt for Earth-like exoplanets it is crucial to have reliable host star parameters, as they have a direct impact on the accuracy and precision of the inferred parameters for any discovered exoplanet. For stars with masses between 0.35 and 0.5 ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ an unexplained radius inflation is observed relative to typical stellar models. However, for fully convective objects with a mass below 0.35 ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ it is not known whether this radius inflation is present as there are fewer objects with accurate measurements in this regime. Low-mass eclipsing binaries present a unique opportunity to determine empirical masses and radii for these low-mass stars. Here we report on such a star, EBLM J2114-39\,B. We have used HARPS and FEROS radial-velocities and \textit{TESS} photometry to perform a joint fit of the data, and produce one of the most precise estimates of a very low mass star's parameters. Using a precise and accurate radius for the primary star using {\it Gaia} DR3 data, we determine J2114-39 to be a $M_1 = 0.998 \pm 0.052$~${\rm M_{\odot}}$ primary star hosting a fully convective secondary with mass $M_2~=~0.0986~\pm 0.0038~\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which lies in a poorly populated region of parameter space. With a radius $R_2 =~0.1275~\pm0.0020~\,\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$, similar to TRAPPIST-1, we see no significant evidence of radius inflation in this system when compared to stellar evolution models. We speculate that stellar models in the regime where radius inflation is observed might be affected by how convective overshooting is treated.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter-wavelength Polarimetry of IRC+10216</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SCUBA-2/POL-2 850 $\mu$m polarimetric observations of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of the carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star IRC+10216. Both FIR and optical polarization data indicate grains aligned with their long axis in the radial direction relative to the central star. The 850 $\mu$m polarization does not show this simple structure. The 850 $\mu$m data are indicative, albeit not conclusive, of a magnetic dipole geometry. Assuming such a simple dipole geometry, the resulting 850 $\mu$m polarization geometry is consistent with both Zeeman observations and small-scale structure in the CSE. While there is significant spectral line polarization contained within the SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m pass-band for the source, it is unlikely that our broadband polarization results are dominated by line polarization. To explain the required grain alignment, grain mineralogy effects, due to either fossil silicate grains from the earlier oxygen-rich AGB phase of the star, or due to the incorporation of ferromagnetic inclusions in the largest grains, may play a role. We argue that the most likely explanation is due to a new alignment mechanism \citep{arXiv:2009.11304} wherein a charged grain, moving relative to the magnetic field, precesses around the induced electric field and therefore aligns with the magnetic field. This mechanism is particularly attractive as the optical, FIR, and sub-mm wave polarization of the carbon dust can then be explained in a consistent way, differing simply due to the charge state of the grains.</description>

      <title>On Binary Formation from Three Initially Unbound Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore three-body binary formation (3BBF), the formation of a bound system via gravitational scattering of three initially unbound bodies (3UB), using direct numerical integrations. For the first time, we consider systems with unequal masses, as well as finite-size and post-Newtonian effects. Our analytically derived encounter rates and numerical scattering results reproduce the 3BBF rate predicted by Goodman \&amp; Hut (1993) for hard binaries in dense star clusters. We find that 3BBF occurs overwhelmingly through nonresonant encounters and that the two most massive bodies are never the most likely to bind. Instead, 3BBF favors pairing the two least massive bodies (for wide binaries) or the most plus least massive bodies (for hard binaries). 3BBF overwhelmingly favors wide binary formation with super-thermal eccentricities, perhaps helping to explain the eccentric wide binaries observed by Gaia. Hard binary formation is far rarer, but with a thermal eccentricity distribution. The semimajor axis distribution scales cumulatively as $a^3$ for hard and slightly wider binaries. Though mergers are rare between black holes when including relativistic effects, direct collisions occur frequently between main-sequence stars -- more often than hard 3BBF. Yet, these collisions do not significantly suppress hard 3BBF at the low velocity dispersions typical of open or globular clusters. Energy dissipation through gravitational radiation leads to a small probability of a bound, hierarchical triple system forming directly from 3UB.</description>

      <title>Stellar Spin Down in Post-Mass Transfer Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by measurements of the rotation speed of accretor stars in post-mass-transfer (post-MT) systems, we investigate how magnetic braking affects the spin-down of individual stars during binary evolution with the MESAbinary module. Unlike the conventional assumption of tidal synchronization coupled with magnetic braking in binaries, we first calculate whether tides are strong enough to synchronize the orbit. Subsequently, this influences the spin-down of stars and the orbital separation. In this study, we apply four magnetic braking prescriptions to reduce the spin angular momentum of the two stars throughout the entire binary evolution simulation. Our findings reveal that despite magnetic braking causing continuous spin-down of the accretor, when the donor begins to transfer material onto the accretor, the accretor can rapidly spin up to its critical rotation rate. After MT, magnetic braking becomes more important in affecting the angular momentum evolution of the stars. Post-MT accretor stars thus serve as a valuable testbed for observing how the magnetic braking prescriptions operate in spinning down stars from their critical rotation, including the saturation regimes of the magnetic braking. The rotation rate of the accretor star, combined with its mass, could provide age information since the cessation of MT. By comparing the models against observation, the magnetic braking prescription by Garraffo et al. (2018b) is found to better align with the rotation data of post-MT accretors.</description>

      <title>M3DIS -- A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale stellar surveys, such as SDSS-V, 4MOST, WEAVE, and PLATO, require accurate atmospheric models and synthetic spectra of stars for accurate analyses of fundamental stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The primary goal of our work is to develop a new approach to solve radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) and generate model stellar spectra in a self-consistent and highly efficient framework. We build upon the Copenhagen legacy RHD code, the MULTI3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) code, and the DISPATCH high-performance framework. The new approach allows us to calculate 3D RHD models of stellar atmospheres on timescales of a few thousand CPU hours and to perform subsequent spectrum synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or NLTE for the desired physical conditions within the parameter space of FGK-type stars. We compare the 3D RHD solar model with other available models and validate its performance against solar observations, including the centre-to-limb variation of intensities and key solar diagnostic lines of H and Fe. We show that the performance of the new code allows to overcome the main bottleneck in 3D NLTE spectroscopy and enables calculations of multi-dimensional grids of synthetic stellar observables for comparison with modern astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Stellar Chromospheric Activity Database of Solar-like Stars Based on the LAMOST Low-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey: II. the bolometric and photospheric calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dependence of stellar magnetic activity on stellar parameters would be inspired by the chromospheric activity studies based on the large-scale spectroscopic surveys. The Ca II H and K lines are employed to construct indicators for assessing and studying the chromospheric activity of solar-like stars. We investigate the widely used bolometric and photospheric calibrated chromospheric activity index $R'_{\rm HK}$, derived from the method in the classic literature ($R'_{\rm HK,classic}$) and the method based on the PHOENIX model ($R'_{\rm HK,PHOENIX}$). Since the detailed stellar atmospheric parameters, effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravity ($\log\,g$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), are available for LAMOST, we estimate the chromospheric activity index $R'_{\rm HK,PHOENIX}$, along with the corresponding bolometric calibrated index $R_{\rm HK,PHOENIX}$, taking these parameters into account. We provide the database of the derived chromospheric activity parameters for 1,122,495 LAMOST LRS spectra of solar-like stars. Our calculations show that $\log\,R'_{\rm HK,PHOENIX}$ is approximately linearly correlated with $\log\,R'_{\rm HK,classic}$. The results based on our extensive archive support the view that the dynamo mechanism of solar-like stars is generally consistent with the Sun; and the value of solar chromospheric activity index is located at the midpoint of the solar-like star sample. We further investigate the proportions of solar-like stars with different chromospheric activity levels (very active, active, inactive and very inactive). The investigation indicates that the occurrence rate of high levels of chromospheric activity is lower among the stars with effective temperatures between $5600$ and $5900 \,{\rm K}$.</description>

      <title>Periastron precession effect of $f$-mode dynamical tides on gravitational waves from eccentric double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical tide can play an important role in the orbital motion of close eccentric double white dwarf binaries. As the launching of the space-based gravitational-wave detector, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), is just around the corner, detection of gravitational wave signals from such systems is anticipated. In this paper, we discuss the influence of the dynamical tide on eccentric orbits, focusing on the effect on orbital precession. We show that in orbits with a high eccentricity, resonance can cause a large precession when a harmonic of the orbital frequency matches the natural frequencies of the normal modes of the star. In contrast to the case with circular orbits, each mode can encounter multiple resonances with different harmonics and these resonant regions can cover about 10% of the frequency space for orbits with close separations. In this case, the tidal precession effect is distinct from the other contributions and can be identified with LISA if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However, within the highly eccentric-small separation region, the dynamical tide causes chaotic motion and the gravitational wave signal becomes unpredictable. Even not at resonance, the dynamical tide can contribute up to 20% of the precession for orbits close to Roche-lobe filling separation with low eccentricities and LISA can resolve these off-resonant dynamical tide effects within the low eccentricity-small orbital separation region of the parameter space. For lower mass systems, the dynamical tide effect can degenerate with the uncertainties of the eccentricity, making it unmeasurable from the precession rate alone. For higher mass systems, the radiation reaction effect becomes significant enough to constrain the eccentricity, allowing the measurement of the dynamical tide.</description>

      <title>A Black-Hole Excision Scheme for General Relativistic Core-Collapse Supernova Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fallback supernovae and the collapsar scenario for long-gamma ray burst and hypernovae have received considerable interest as pathways to black-hole formation and extreme transient events. Consistent simulations of these scenarios require a general relativistic treatment and need to deal appropriately with the formation of a singularity. Free evolution schemes for the Einstein equations can handle the formation of black holes by means of excision or puncture schemes. However, in constrained schemes, which offer distinct advantages in long-term numerical stability in stellar collapse simulations over well above $10^{4}$ light-crossing time scales, the dynamical treatment of black-hole spacetimes is more challenging. Building on previous work on excision in conformally flat spacetimes, we here present the implementation of a black-hole excision scheme for supernova simulations with the CoCoNuT-FMT neutrino transport code. We describe in detail a choice of boundary conditions that ensures long-time numerical stability, and also address upgrades to the hydrodynamics solver that are required to stably evolve the relativistic accretion flow onto the black hole. The scheme is currently limited to a spherically symmetric metric, but the hydrodynamics can be treated multi-dimensionally. For demonstration, we present a spherically symmetric simulation of black-hole formation in an $85 M_\odot$ star, as well as a two-dimensional simulation of the fallback explosion of the same progenitor. These extend past 9s and 0.3s after black-hole formation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Viscous hydrodynamic evolution of neutron star merger accretion disks: a code comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accretion disk formed after a neutron star merger is an important contributor to the total ejecta from the merger, and hence to the kilonova and the $r$-process yields of each event. Axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic simulations of these disks can capture thermal mass ejection due to neutrino absorption and in the advective phase -- after neutrino cooling has subsided -- and are thus likely to provide a lower-limit to the total disk ejecta relative to MHD evolution. Here we present a comparison between two viscous hydrodynamic codes that have been used extensively on this problem over the past decade: ALCAR and FLASH. We choose a representative setup with a black hole at the center, and vary the treatment of viscosity and neutrino transport. We find good overall agreement ($\sim 10\%$ level) in most quantities. The average outflow velocity is sensitive to the treatment of the nuclear binding energy of heavy nuclei, showing a larger variation than other quantities. We post-process trajectories from both codes with the same nuclear network, and explore the effects of code differences on nucleosynthesis yields, heating rates, and kilonova light curves. For the latter, we also assess the effect of varying the number of tracer particles in reconstructing the spatial abundance distribution for kilonova light curve production.</description>

      <title>Ground-based and JWST Observations of SN 2022pul: II. Evidence from Nebular Spectroscopy for a Violent Merger in a Peculiar Type-Ia Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of ground-based and JWST observations of SN~2022pul, a peculiar "03fg-like" (or "super-Chandrasekhar") Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), in the nebular phase at 338d post explosion. Our combined spectrum continuously covers 0.4--14 $\mu$m and includes the first mid-infrared spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia. Compared to normal SN Ia 2021aefx, SN 2022pul exhibits a lower mean ionization state, asymmetric emission-line profiles, stronger emission from the intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) argon and calcium, weaker emission from iron-group elements (IGEs), and the first unambiguous detection of neon in a SN Ia. Strong, broad, centrally peaked [Ne II] line at 12.81 $\mu$m was previously predicted as a hallmark of "violent merger'' SN Ia models, where dynamical interaction between two sub-$M_{ch}$ white dwarfs (WDs) causes disruption of the lower mass WD and detonation of the other. The violent merger scenario was already a leading hypothesis for 03fg-like SNe Ia; in SN 2022pul it can explain the large-scale ejecta asymmetries seen between the IMEs and IGEs and the central location of narrow oxygen and broad neon. We modify extant models to add clumping of the ejecta to better reproduce the optical iron emission, and add mass in the innermost region ($&lt; 2000$ km s$^{-1}$) to account for the observed narrow [O I]~$\lambda\lambda6300$, 6364 emission. A violent WD-WD merger explains many of the observations of SN 2022pul, and our results favor this model interpretation for the subclass of 03fg-like SN Ia.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Events from three-body scatterings and eccentricity pumping in the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are routinely observed in quiescent galaxies, as stars from the nuclear star cluster are scattered into the loss cone of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). TDEs are also expected to occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), due to scattering or orbital eccentricity pumping of stars embedded in the innermost regions of the AGN accretion disk. Encounters with embedded stellar-mass black holes (BH) can result in AGN $\mu$TDEs. AGN TDEs and $\mu$TDEs could therefore account for a fraction of observed AGN variability. Here, by performing scattering experiments with the few-body code {\tt SpaceHub}, we compute the probability of AGN TDEs and $\mu$TDEs as a result of 3-body interactions between stars and binary BHs. We find that AGN TDEs are more probable during the early life of the AGNs, when rates are $\sim (6\times 10^{-5}-5 \times 10^{-2}) (f_\bullet/0.01)$ $~\rm{AGN}^{-1}$~yr$^{-1}$ (where $f_\bullet$ is the ratio between the number density of BHs and stars), generally higher than in quiescent galactic nuclei. By contrast, $\mu$TDEs should occur throughout the AGN lifetime at a rate of $\sim (1\times 10^{-4} - 4\times 10^{-2} (f_\bullet/0.01)$ $~\rm{AGN}^{-1}$~yr$^{-1}$. Detection and characterization of AGN TDEs and $\mu$ AGN TDEs with future surveys using {\em Rubin} and {\em Roman} will help constrain the populations of stars and compact objects embedded in AGN disks, a key input for the LVK AGN channel.</description>

      <title>Comparative simulations of Kelvin-Helmholtz induced magnetic reconnection at the Earth's magnetospheric flanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents three-dimensional (3D) resistive Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) dynamics at Earth's magnetospheric flanks during northward interplanetary magnetic field periods. By comparing two simulations with and without initial magnetic shear, we analyze the impact of distinct magnetic field orientations on plasma dynamics and magnetic reconnection events taking into account 3D mechanisms, such as KHI high latitude stabilization. The identical nature of the simulations, except for the presence/absence of an initial magnetic shear, enables, for the first time, a complete and coherent comparative analysis of the latitudinal distribution of KH vortices, current sheets, reconnection events, and the evolution of the mixing layer. In one configuration, a uniform magnetic field leads to double mid-latitude reconnection (MLR), while in the other, magnetic shear induces both type I vortex-induced reconnection (VIR) and MLR. Notably, the type I VIR observed in this second scenario results from the combined action of line advection and vortex-induced current sheet pinching (the classic mechanism driving two-dimensional type I VIR). Of particular importance is our quantification of newly closed field lines that experienced double reconnection, ultimately becoming embedded in solar wind plasma at low latitudes while remaining connected to magnetospheric plasma at high latitudes. The varying abundance of such lines in the two simulations holds implications for plasma transport at the magnetopause.</description>

      <title>From Cavitation to Astrophysics: Explicit Solution of the Spherical Collapse Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations of the form $\ddot R=-kR^\gamma$, with a positive constant $k$ and real parameter $\gamma$, are fundamental in describing phenomena such as the spherical gravitational collapse ($\gamma=-2$), the implosion of cavitation bubbles ($\gamma=-4$) and the orbital decay in binary black holes ($\gamma=-7$). While explicit elemental solutions exist for select integer values of $\gamma$, more comprehensive solutions encompassing larger subsets of $\gamma$ have been independently developed in hydrostatics (see Lane-Emden equation) and hydrodynamics (see Rayleigh-Plesset equation). I here present a universal explicit solution for all real $\gamma$, invoking the beta distribution. Although standard numerical ODE solvers can readily evaluate more general second order differential equations, this explicit solution reveals a hidden connection between collapse motions and probability theory that enables further analytical manipulations, it conceptually unifies distinct fields, and it offers insights into symmetry properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these pervasive differential equations.</description>

      <title>Formation of GW230529 from Isolated Binary Evolution and Its Electromagnetic Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this {\em{Letter}}, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic counterparts. By adopting the `delayed' supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the rate densities of mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers inferred from the population analyses, along with the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Because GW230529 contributes significantly to the inferred mgBHNS rate densities, we suggest that GW230529 can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the AP4 (DD2) equation of state, the probability that GW230529 can make tidal disruption is $12.8\%$ ($63.2\%$). If GW230529 is a disrupted event, its kilonova peak apparent magnitude is predicted $\sim23-24\,{\rm{mag}}$, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and LSST. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by $\gamma$-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. Our study suggests the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel due to the discovery of GW230529, indicating that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for $\sim50\%$ cosmological BHNS population, we find that $\gtrsim90\%$ disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.</description>

      <title>TOI-837b is a Young Saturn-sized Exoplanet with a Massive 70 $M_{\oplus}$ Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of TOI-837, a F9/G0 35 Myr young star, hosting a transiting exoplanet, TOI-837b, with an orbital period of 8.32d. Utilising data from TESS and ground-based observations, we determine a planetary radius of 0.82 R_J for TOI-837b. Through detailed HARPS spectroscopic time series analysis, we derive a Doppler semi-amplitude of 35 m/s, corresponding to a planetary mass of 0.39 M_J. The derived planetary properties suggest a substantial core of approximately 70 M_E, constituting about 60% of the planet's total mass. This finding poses a significant challenge to existing theoretical models of core formation. We propose that future atmospheric observations with JWST could provide insights into resolving ambiguities of TOI-837b, offering new perspectives on its composition, formation, and evolution.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamical Evolution of Simulated Satellites for a Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of Milky Way's satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around ten times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the $\alpha$-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to supernova feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of $\gtrsim$ 1,000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Supernova Explosions of the Lowest-Mass Massive Star Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be two to ten times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the $^{56}$Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of proto-neutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as $\sim$50\% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and $^{48}$Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.</description>

      <title>Investigating stellar activity through eight years of Sun-as-a-star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic activity induces both distortions and Doppler-shifts in the absorption line profiles of Sun-like stars. Those effects produce apparent radial velocity (RV) signals which greatly hamper the search for potentially habitable, Earth-like planets. In this work, we investigate these distortions in the Sun using cross-correlation functions (CCFs), derived from intensive monitoring with the high-precision spectrograph HARPS-N. We show that the RV signal arising from line-shape variations on time-scales associated with the solar rotation and activity cycle can be robustly extracted from the data, reducing the RV dispersion by half. Once these have been corrected, activity-induced Doppler-shifts remain, that are modulated at the solar rotation period, and that are most effectively modelled in the time domain, using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Planet signatures are still best retrieved with multi-dimensonal GPs, when activity is jointly modelled from the raw RVs and indicators of the line width or of the Ca II H and K emission. After GP modelling, the residual RVs exhibit a dispersion of 0.6-0.8 m/s, likely to be dominated by signals induced by super-granulation. Finally, we find that the statistical properties of the RVs evolve significantly over time, and that this evolution is primarily driven by sunspots, which control the smoothness of the signal. Such evolution, which reduces the sensitivity to long-period planet signatures, is no longer seen in the activity-induced Doppler-shifts, which is promising for long term RV monitoring surveys such as the Terra Hunting Experiment or the PLATO follow-up campaign.</description>
