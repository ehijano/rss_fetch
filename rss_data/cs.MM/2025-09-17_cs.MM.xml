      <title>Evaluation of Objective Image Quality Metrics for High-Fidelity Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, image compression solutions are increasingly designed to operate within high-fidelity quality ranges, where preserving even the most subtle details of the original image is essential. In this context, the ability to detect and quantify subtle compression artifacts becomes critically important, as even slight degradations can impact perceptual quality in professional or quality sensitive applications, such as digital archiving, professional editing and web delivery. However, the performance of current objective image quality assessment metrics in this range has not been thoroughly investigated. In particular, it is not well understood how reliably these metrics estimate distortions at or below the threshold of Just Noticeable Difference (JND). This study directly addresses this issue by proposing evaluation methodologies for assessing the performance of objective quality metrics and performing a comprehensive evaluation using the JPEG AIC-3 dataset which is designed for high-fidelity image compression. Beyond conventional criteria, the study introduces Z-RMSE to incorporate subjective score uncertainty and applies novel statistical tests to assess significant differences between metrics. The analysis spans the full JPEG AIC-3 range and its high- and medium-fidelity subsets, examines the impact of cropping in subjective tests, and a public dataset with benchmarks and evaluation tools is released to support further research.</description>

      <title>A Traditional Approach to Symbolic Piano Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a traditional approach to symbolic piano music continuation for the MIREX 2025 Symbolic Music Generation challenge. While computational music generation has recently focused on developing large foundation models with sophisticated architectural modifications, we argue that simpler approaches remain more effective for constrained, single-instrument tasks. We thus return to a simple, unaugmented next-token-prediction objective on tokenized raw MIDI, aiming to outperform large foundation models by using better data and better fundamentals. We release model weights and code at https://github.com/christianazinn/mirex2025.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Improving LVLMs on Event Extraction from Multimedia Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities, their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2 and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only, image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.</description>

      <title>Winds Through Time: Interactive Data Visualization and Physicalization for Paleoclimate Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a multidisciplinary collaboration to iteratively design an interactive exhibit for a public science center on paleoclimate, the study of past climates. We created a data physicalisation of mountains and ice sheets that can be tangibly manipulated by visitors to interact with a wind simulation visualisation that demonstrates how the climate of North America differed dramatically between now and the peak of the last ice age. We detail the system for interaction and visualisation plus design choices to appeal to an audience that ranges from children to scientists and responds to site requirements.</description>

      <title>Palmprint De-Identification Using Diffusion Model for High-Quality and Diverse Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Palmprint recognition techniques have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling reliable recognition even when palmprints are captured in uncontrolled or challenging environments. However, this strength also introduces new risks, as publicly available palmprint images can be misused by adversaries for malicious activities. Despite this growing concern, research on methods to obscure or anonymize palmprints remains largely unexplored. Thus, it is essential to develop a palmprint de-identification technique capable of removing identity-revealing features while retaining the image's utility and preserving non-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse, high-quality palmprint images that conceal identity features for de-identification purposes. To ensure greater stability and controllability in the synthesis process, we incorporate a semantic-guided embedding fusion alongside a prior interpolation mechanism. We further propose the de-identification ratio, a novel metric for intuitive de-identification assessment. Extensive experiments across multiple palmprint datasets and recognition methods demonstrate that our method effectively conceals identity-related traits with significant diversity across de-identified samples. The de-identified samples preserve high visual fidelity and maintain excellent usability, achieving a balance between de-identification and retaining non-identity information.</description>
