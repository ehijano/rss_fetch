      <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects on the Electronic Structure of Water and Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic properties and optical response of ice and water are intricately shaped by their molecular structure, including the quantum mechanical nature of hydrogen atoms. In spite of numerous studies appeared over decades, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of the nuclear quantum motion on the electronic structure of water and ice at finite temperatures remains elusive. Here, we utilize molecular simulations that harness the efficiency of machine-learning potentials and many-body perturbation theory to assess the impact of nuclear quantum effects on the electronic structure of water and hexagonal ice. By comparing the results of path-integral and classical simulations, we find that including nuclear quantum effects leads to a larger renormalization of the fundamental gap of ice, compared to that of water, eventually leading to a comparable gap in the two systems, consistent with experimental estimates. Our calculations suggest that the quantum fluctuations responsible for an increased delocalization of protons in ice, relative to water, are a key factor leading to the enhancement of nuclear quantum effects on the electronic structure of ice.</description>

      <title>Controlled molecule injector for cold, dense, and pure molecular beams at the European x-ray free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permanently available molecular-beam injection setup for controlled molecules (COMO) was installed and commissioned at the small quantum systems (SQS) instrument at the European x-ray free-electron laser (EuXFEL). A $b$-type electrostatic deflector allows for pure state-, size-, and isomer-selected samples of polar molecules and clusters. The source provides a rotationally cold ($T\approx1$~K) and dense ($\rho\approx10^8$~cm$^{-3}$) molecular beam with pulse durations up to 100~\us generated by a new version of the Even-Lavie valve. Here, a performance overview of the COMO setup is presented along with characterization experiments performed both, with an optical laser at the Center for Free-Electron-Laser Science and with x-rays at EuXFEL under burst-mode operation. COMO was designed to be attached to different instruments at the EuXFEL, in particular at the small quantum systems (SQS) and single particles, clusters, and biomolecules (SPB) instruments. This advanced controlled-molecules injection setup enables XFEL studies using highly defined samples with soft and hard x-ray FEL radiation for applications ranging from atomic, molecular, and cluster physics to elementary processes in chemistry and biology.</description>

      <title>Unimolecular processes in diatomic carbon anions at high rotational excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the millisecond to second time scale, stored beams of diatomic carbon anions C$_2{}^-$ from a sputter ion source feature unimolecular decay of yet unexplained origin by electron emission and fragmentation. To account for the magnitude and time dependence of the experimental rates, levels with high rotational and vibrational excitation are modeled for the lowest electronic states of C$_2{}^-$, also including the lowest quartet potential. Energies, spontaneous radiative decay rates (including spin-forbidden quartet-level decay), and tunneling dissociation rates are determined for a large number of highly excited C$_2{}^-$ levels and their population in sputter-type ion sources is considered. For the quartet levels, the stability against autodetachment is addressed and recently calculated rates of rotationally assisted autodetachment are applied. Non-adiabatic vibrational autodetachment rates of high vibrational levels in the doublet C$_2{}^-$ ground potential are also calculated. The results are combined to model the experimental unimolecular decay signals. Comparison of the modeled to the experimental rates measured at the Croygenic Storage Ring (CSR) gives strong evidence that C$_2{}^-$ ions in quasi-stable levels of the quartet electronic states are the so far unidentified source of unimolecular decay.</description>

      <title>Autodetachment of diatomic carbon anions from long-lived high-rotation quartet states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly excited C$_2{}^{-}$ ions prominently feature electron detachment at a mean decay time near 3 milliseconds with hitherto unexplained origin. Considering various sources of unimolecular decay, we attribute the signal to the electronic C$^4\Sigma^+_u$ state. Quartet C$_2{}^{-}$ levels are found to be stabilized against autodetachment by high rotation. Time constants of their rotationally assisted autodetachment into levels opening energetically at lower rotation are calculated by a theory based on the non-local resonance model. For some final levels of significantly less rotation the results conclusively explain the puzzling observations.</description>

      <title>Symbolic construction of the chemical Jacobian of quasi-steady state (QSS) chemistries for Exascale computing platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA) can be an effective tool for reducing the size and stiffness of chemical mechanisms for implementation in computational reacting flow solvers. However, for many applications, stiffness remains, and the resulting model requires implicit methods for efficient time integration. In this paper, we outline an approach to formulating the QSSA reduction that is coupled with a strategy to generate C++ source code to evaluate the net species production rate, and the chemical Jacobian. The code-generation component employs a symbolic approach enabling a simple and effective strategy to analytically compute the chemical Jacobian. For computational tractability, the symbolic approach needs to be paired with common subexpression elimination which can negatively affect memory usage. Several solutions are outlined and successfully tested on a 3D multipulse ignition problem, thus allowing portable application across a chemical model sizes and GPU capabilities. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Towards accurate spin-orbit splittings from relativistic multireference electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most nonrelativistic electron correlation methods can be adapted to account for relativistic effects, as long as the relativistic molecular spinor integrals are available, from either a four-, two-, or one-component mean-field calculation. However, relativistic multireference correlation methods remain a relatively unexplored area, with mixed evidence regarding the improvements brought by perturbative treatments. We report, for the first time, the implementation of state-averaged four-component multireference perturbation theories to second and third order based on the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). With our methods, named 4c-SA-DSRG-MRPT2 and 3, we find that the dynamical correlation included on top of 4c-CASSCF references can significantly improve the spin-orbit splittings in p-block elements and potential energy surfaces when compared to 4c-CASSCF and 4c-CASPT2 results. We further show that 4c-DSRG-MRPT2 and 3 are applicable to these systems over a wide range of the flow parameter, with systematic improvement from second to third order in terms of both improved error statistics and reduced sensitivity with respect to the flow parameter.</description>

      <title>P-doping improves the stability of BP-N at ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black phosphorus nitrogen (BP-N) is an attractive high-energy density material. However, high pressure synthesized BP-N will decompose at low pressure and cannot exist under ambient conditions. Finding a method to stabilize it at atmospheric pressure is of great significance for its practical applications. However, unlike cg-N, LP-N, and HLP-N, it is not in ground state on the enthalpy-pressure curve under all pressure, and it exhibits imaginary frequencies in its phonon spectrum under 0 GPa. In our study, we have discovered that P doping can effectively reduce the synthesis pressure of BP-N and maintain its stability under atmospheric conditions. Homogeneous doping within the layers helps maintain the static structural stability of layer, while specific interlayer doping enhances its dynamic stability by eliminating interlayer slipping. the calculated energy density of 12.5% doping is 7.49 kJ/g, which is twice the energy density of TNT. This highlights the significance of doping as an effective approach to achieve stable and high-performance BP-N.</description>

      <title>Local topology and perestroikas in protein structure and folding dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods of local topology are introduced to the field of protein physics. This is achieved by explaining how the folding and unfolding processes of a globular protein alter the local topology of the protein's C-alpha backbone through conformational bifurcations. The mathematical formulation builds on the concept of Arnol'd's perestroikas, by extending it to piecewise linear chains using the discrete Frenet frame formalism. In the low-temperature folded phase, the backbone geometry generalizes the concept of a Peano curve, with its modular building blocks modeled by soliton solutions of a discretized nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The onset of thermal unfolding begins when perestroikas change the flattening and branch points that determine the centers of solitons. When temperature increases, the perestroikas cascade, which leads to a progressive disintegration of the modular structures. The folding and unfolding processes are quantitatively characterized by a correlation function that describes the evolution of perestroikas under temperature changes. The approach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the Physics of protein folding and unfolding transitions, contributing to the broader field of protein structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Initial Stages of Water Absorption on $\mathbf{CeO}_{2}$ Surfaces at Very Low Temperatures for Understanding Anti-Icing Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-icing coatings are intended to prevent ice formation on surfaces, minimising the risk of surface-related damage and also reducing ice-related hazards in society. $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ coatings are robust, hydrophobic, and transmit light, thus they are suitable for a range of applications. However, their evolving surface chemistry during the initial stages of $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ exposure at very low temperatures has not been investigated, despite that this is important for understanding their anti-icing properties. To study this, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ coatings were grown by sputter deposition, cooled to $\approx100\,$K and exposed to a $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ atmosphere at $1\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{mbar}$. We demonstrate the usefulness of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a tool for investigating the anti-icing properties of surfaces. We present XPS measurements of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ coatings before and after exposure to $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$, in-situ and at cryogenic temperatures. XPS reveals that little to no ice forms on the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ after the $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ exposure at $\approx100\,$K. In contrast, ice was observed all over the sample holder on which the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was mounted. These findings suggest that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is a promising candidate for future anti-icing coatings.</description>

      <title>Swallowing the Bitter Pill: Simplified Scalable Conformer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel way to predict molecular conformers through a simple formulation that sidesteps many of the heuristics of prior works and achieves state of the art results by using the advantages of scale. By training a diffusion generative model directly on 3D atomic positions without making assumptions about the explicit structure of molecules (e.g. modeling torsional angles) we are able to radically simplify structure learning, and make it trivial to scale up the model sizes. This model, called Molecular Conformer Fields (MCF), works by parameterizing conformer structures as functions that map elements from a molecular graph directly to their 3D location in space. This formulation allows us to boil down the essence of structure prediction to learning a distribution over functions. Experimental results show that scaling up the model capacity leads to large gains in generalization performance without enforcing inductive biases like rotational equivariance. MCF represents an advance in extending diffusion models to handle complex scientific problems in a conceptually simple, scalable and effective manner.</description>

Abstract: We have investigated how Langevin dynamics is affected by the friction coefficient using the novel algorithm ISOKANN, which combines the transfer operator approach with modern machine learning techniques. ISOKANN describes the dynamics in terms of an invariant subspace projection of the Koopman operator defined in the entire state space, avoiding approximations due to dimensionality reduction and discretization. Our results are consistent with the Kramers turnover and show that in the low and moderate friction regimes, metastable macro-states and transition rates are defined in phase space, not only in position space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convincing evidence of domain growth in the heating of ultrastable glasses suggests that the equilibration dynamics of super-cooled liquids could be driven by a nucleation and growth mechanism. We investigate this possibility by simulating the equilibration dynamics of a model glass during both heating and cooling between poorly and well-annealed states. Though we do observe the growth of domains during heating, we find that domains are absent during cooling. This absence is inconsistent with classical nucleation theory. By comparing the equilibration dynamics of our glass with that of two models with kinetic constraints, we demonstrate that dynamical facilitation generically leads to heating driven by domain growth and cooling without domains. Our results provide strong evidence that dynamical facilitation, not nucleation and interfacial-tension-driven domain growth, is the driving mechanism for the equilibration dynamics of glass-formers.</description>

      <title>A universal strategy for decoupling stiffness and extensibility of polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the invention of polymer networks in the 19th century (e.g., crosslinked natural rubber by Goodyear), it has been a dogma that stiffer networks are less stretchable, a trade-off inherent to the molecular nature of polymer network strands. Here, we report a universal strategy for decoupling the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely proportional to the network strand mass and is determined by the side chains. We validate this concept by creating a series of unentangled single-network elastomers with nearly constant Young's modulus (30 kPa) while increasing tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20% to 800%. We show that this strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies. Our discovery opens an avenue for developing polymer networks with extraordinary mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>A Framework of SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representation Learning and its Application to Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present both a theoretical and a methodological framework that addresses a critical challenge in applying deep learning to physical systems: the reconciliation of non-linear expressiveness with SO(3)-equivariance in predictions of SO(3)-equivariant quantities, such as the electronic-structure Hamiltonian. Inspired by covariant theory in physics, we address this problem by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. We first construct theoretical SO(3)-invariant quantities derived from the SO(3)-equivariant regression targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the encoding process for invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this foundation, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant representations, while theoretically preserving their equivariant properties as we prove. Our approach offers a promising general solution to the critical dilemma between equivariance and non-linear expressiveness in deep learning methodologies. We apply our theory and method to the electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across six benchmark databases.</description>
