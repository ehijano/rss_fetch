      <title>Dynamic Factor Allocation Leveraging Regime-Switching Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores dynamic factor allocation by analyzing the cyclical performance of factors through regime analysis. The authors focus on a U.S. equity investment universe comprising seven long-only indices representing the market and six style factors: value, size, momentum, quality, low volatility, and growth. Their approach integrates factor-specific regime inferences of each factor index's active performance relative to the market into the Black-Litterman model to construct a fully-invested, long-only multi-factor portfolio. First, the authors apply the sparse jump model (SJM) to identify bull and bear market regimes for individual factors, using a feature set based on risk and return measures from historical factor active returns, as well as variables reflecting the broader market environment. The regimes identified by the SJM exhibit enhanced stability and interpretability compared to traditional methods. A hypothetical single-factor long-short strategy is then used to assess these regime inferences and fine-tune hyperparameters, resulting in a positive Sharpe ratio of this strategy across all factors with low correlation among them. These regime inferences are then incorporated into the Black-Litterman framework to dynamically adjust allocations among the seven indices, with an equally weighted (EW) portfolio serving as the benchmark. Empirical results show that the constructed multi-factor portfolio significantly improves the information ratio (IR) relative to the market, raising it from just 0.05 for the EW benchmark to approximately 0.4. When measured relative to the EW benchmark itself, the dynamic allocation achieves an IR of around 0.4 to 0.5. The strategy also enhances absolute portfolio performance across key metrics such as the Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown.</description>

      <title>Risk Aggregation and Allocation in the Presence of Systematic Risk via Stable Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to properly manage risk, practitioners must understand the aggregate risks they are exposed to. Additionally, to properly price policies and calculate bonuses the relative riskiness of individual business units must be well understood. Certainly, Insurers and Financiers are interested in the properties of the sums of the risks they are exposed to and the dependence of risks therein. Realistic risk models however must account for a variety of phenomena: ill-defined moments, lack of elliptical dependence structures, excess kurtosis and highly heterogeneous marginals. Equally important is the concern over industry-wide systematic risks that can affect multiple business lines at once. Many techniques of varying sophistication have been developed with all or some of these problems in mind. We propose a modification to the classical individual risk model that allows us to model company-wide losses via the class of Multivariate Stable Distributions. Stable Distributions incorporate many of the unpleasant features required for a realistic risk model while maintaining tractable aggregation and dependence results. We additionally compute the Tail Conditional Expectation of aggregate risks within the model and the corresponding allocations.</description>

      <title>Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing Revisited: Did we Find a Fatal Flaw?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The option pricing formula of Black and Scholes (1973) hinges on the continuous-time self-financing condition, which is a special case of the continuous-time budget equation of Merton (1971). The self-financing condition is believed to formalize the economic concept of portfolio rebalancing without inflows or outflows of external funds, but was never formally derived in continuous time. Moreover, and even more problematically, we discover a timing mistake in the model of Merton (1971) and show that his self-financing condition is misspecified both in discrete and continuous time. Our results invalidate seminal contributions to the literature, including the budget equation of Merton (1971), the option pricing formula of Black and Scholes (1973), the continuous trading model of Harrison and Pliska (1981), and the binomial option pricing model of Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979). We also show that Black and Scholes (1973) and alternative derivations of their formula implicitly assumed the replication result.</description>
