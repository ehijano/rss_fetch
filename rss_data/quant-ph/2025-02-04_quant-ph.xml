      <title>Super Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Super Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization. In its simplest form, SQM considers states in the form of unitary operators, where the quadratic constraints are conditions of unitarity. In this case, the stationary SQM problem is a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers the evolution of a quantum system, distinct from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Several options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered, and quantum circuits of 2D type are introduced, which transform one quantum system into another. Although no known physical process currently describes such dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithm. Beyond computer modeling, the developed theory could be directly applied if or when a physical process capable of solving an inverse quantum problem in a single measurement act (analogous to wavefunction measurement in traditional quantum mechanics) is discovered in the future.</description>

      <title>Entropic costs of the quantum-to-classical transition in a microscopic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically, which we refer to as the quantum-to-classical transition. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</description>

      <title>Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00098v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, states that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various benchmarking metrics have been developed to quantify the performance of quantum computing hardware and help evaluate development. However, it is not always necessary to know the metric values precisely. This is especially true for potential end-users who may not be experts in the underlying technology itself. In this work, we show how to estimate the quantum volumetric metrics defined in Ref. [1] based on system parameters such as qubit number, qubit layout/connectivity, and physical error rates. As part of this work, we also include an initial analysis of how the overhead required for quantum error correction in systems below the error correction viability threshold affects the metric value of that system.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limits of the Mpemba effect: A unified resource theory analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, a counterintuitive thermodynamic phenomenon in which a hotter system cools more rapidly than a colder one, has been observed in both classical and quantum systems. However, its fundamental mechanisms remain inadequately understood. In this letter, we investigate the role of classical and quantum correlations in driving anomalous relaxation behaviors within the framework of quantum resource theories. Through an analysis of multi-qubit systems in local thermal equilibrium, we establish that classical correlations alone can give rise to the Mpemba effect, while quantum correlations become relevant under specific energy degeneracy conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Markovian memory effects and Hilbert space dimensionality play a crucial role in determining the temperature range over which this effect manifests. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the original anomalous cooling behavior observed in water may also arise from classical or quantum correlations, offering new insights into the underlying mechanisms of the phenomena collectively referred to as the Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Coherence based on positive operator-valued measures for standard and concatenated quantum state discrimination with inconclusive results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal measurement that discriminates nonorthogonal quantum states with fixed rates of inconclusive outcomes (FRIO) can be decomposed into an assisted separation of the inputs, yielding conclusive and inconclusive outputs, followed by a minimum-error (ME) measurement for the conclusive ones (standard FRIO) or both ones (concatenated FRIO). The implementation of these measurements is underpinned by quantum resources, and here we investigate coherence based on positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) as a resource for both strategies in discriminating equally probable symmetric states of arbitrary dimension. First, we show that the POVM coherence in the assisted separation stage decomposes into the coherence of the ancillary state and the quantum discord between the system and the ancilla, evidencing coherence as a more elementary resource than quantum correlations. Next, it is demonstrated that the POVM coherence for standard and concatenated FRIO decomposes into the POVM coherence measures for state separation and ME measurement, weighted by the probabilities of occurrence of each event. Due to the ME discrimination of inconclusive states, the coherence required for the concatenated scheme is shown to be greater than that of the standard one. We discuss other general aspects of our results by characterizing the POVM coherence in the discrimination of qutrit states, with respect to the distinguishability of the inputs and the inconclusive rate. Finally, by exploiting POVM-based coherence as a quantifier of cryptographic randomness gain, we discuss the standard and concatenated FRIO strategies from the perspective of generating random bits that are secret to an eavesdropper.</description>

      <title>Randomized Benchmarking with Leakage Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leakage errors are unwanted transfer of population outside of a defined computational subspace and they occur in almost every platform for quantum computing. While prevalent, leakage is often overlooked when measuring and reporting the performance of quantum computers with standard randomized benchmarking methods. In fact, when leakage is substantial it can cause a large overestimation of fidelity. We provide several methods for measuring fidelity with randomized benchmarking in the presence of leakage errors that are applicable in different error regimes or under differnt control assumptions. We numerically demonstrate the methods for two-qubit randomized benchmarking, which often have the largest leakage contribution. Finally, we implement the methods on previously shared data from Quantinuum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements with feed-forward are crucial components of fault-tolerant quantum computers. We show how the error rate of such a measurement can be directly estimated by fitting the probability that successive randomly compiled measurements all return the ideal outcome. Unlike conventional randomized benchmarking experiments and alternative measurement characterization protocols, all the data can be obtained using a single sufficiently large number of successive measurements. We also prove that generalized Pauli fidelities are invariant under randomized compiling and can be combined with the error rate to characterize the underlying errors up to a gauge transformation that introduces an ambiguity between errors happening before or after measurements.</description>

      <title>Left-Deep Join Order Selection with Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Join order optimization is among the most crucial query optimization problems, and its central position is also evident in the new research field where quantum computing is applied to database optimization and data management. In the field, join order optimization is the most studied database problem, usually tackled with a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model, which is solved with various meta-heuristics such as quantum annealing, quantum approximate optimization algorithm, or variational quantum eigensolver. In this work, we continue developing quantum computing techniques for join order optimization by presenting three novel quantum optimization algorithms. These algorithms are based on a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization model, which is a generalization of the quadratic model and has not previously been applied to database problems. Theoretically, these optimization problems naturally map to universal quantum computers and quantum annealers. Compared to previous research, two of our algorithms are the first quantum algorithms to precisely model the join order cost function. We prove theoretical bounds by showing that these two methods encode the same plans as the dynamic programming algorithm without cross-products, which provides the optimal result up to cross-products. The third algorithm reaches at least as good plans as the greedy algorithm without cross-products. These results set an important theoretical connection between the classical and quantum algorithms for join order selection, which has not been studied in the previous research. To demonstrate our algorithms' practical usability, we have conducted an experimental evaluation on thousands of clique, cycle, star, tree, and chain query graphs using quantum and classical solvers.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Assessing Node Importance in the st-Connectivity Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problems in distributed security often map naturally to graphs. The centrality of nodes assesses the importance of nodes in a graph. It is used in various applications. Cooperative game theory has been used to create nuanced and flexible notions of node centrality. However, the approach is often computationally complex to implement classically. This work describes a quantum approach to approximating the importance of nodes that maintain a target connection. Additionally, we detail a method for quickly identifying high-importance nodes. The approximation method relies on quantum subroutines for st-connectivity, approximating Shapley values, and finding the maximum of a list. Finding important nodes relies on a quantum algorithm for finding the maximum. We consider st-connectivity attack scenarios in which a malicious actor disrupts a subset of nodes to perturb the system functionality. Our methods identify the nodes that are most important with the aim of minimizing the impact of the attack. The node centrality metric identifies where more redundancy is required and can be used to enhance network resiliency. Finally, we explore the potential complexity benefits of our quantum approach in contrast to classical random sampling.</description>

      <title>On Multiquantum Bits, Segre Embeddings and Coxeter Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the interplay between quantum information theory, algebraic geometry, and number theory, with a particular focus on multiqubit systems, their entanglement structure, and their classification via geometric embeddings. The Segre embedding, a fundamental construction in algebraic geometry, provides an algebraic framework to distinguish separable and entangled states, encoding quantum correlations in projective geometry. We develop a systematic study of qubit moduli spaces, illustrating the geometric structure of entanglement through hypercube constructions and Coxeter chamber decompositions.
  We establish a bijection between the Segre embeddings of tensor products of projective spaces and binary words of length $n-1$, structured as an $(n-1)$-dimensional hypercube, where adjacency corresponds to a single Segre operation. This reveals a combinatorial structure underlying the hierarchy of embeddings, with direct implications for quantum error correction schemes. The symmetry of the Segre variety under the Coxeter group of type $A$ allows us to analyze quantum states and errors through the lens of reflection groups, viewing separable states as lying in distinct Coxeter chambers on a Segre variety. The transitive action of the permutation group on these chambers provides a natural method for tracking errors in quantum states and potentially reversing them. Beyond foundational aspects, we highlight relations between Segre varieties and Dixon elliptic curves, drawing connections between entanglement and number theory.</description>

      <title>Extended analysis of distillation and purification of squeezed states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed states of light are one of the most important fundamental resources for quantum optics, optical quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that the squeezing of single-mode squeezed vacuum states can be enhanced by probabilistic two-photon subtraction. A further enhancement of the squeezing is subsequently possible by heralded Gaussification that distills a Gaussian state from the de-Gaussified two-photon subtracted state. Here we provide an extended theoretical analysis of squeezing distillation and purification. We consider a more general scheme in which photon subtraction is combined with a weak coherent displacement. This more flexible scheme allows to enhance squeezing for arbitrary input squeezing value. Moreover, if the modified two-photon subtraction operation is properly chosen, then arbitrary strong squeezing can be distilled by subsequent Gaussification. We go beyond pure states and show that the combination of photon subtraction and heralded Gaussification cannot suppress losses that have affected the input state. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative de-Gaussifying operation based on a Fock-state filter that removes the single-photon state. With this de-Gaussifying operation and subsequent re-Gaussification, pure single-mode squeezed states can be distilled from a large class of mixed input states. Interestingly, we have found that squeezing distillation by two-photon subtraction is closely related to certain methods for generating Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, which are crucial for optical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference with time-frequency modes and multiple-photons generated by a silicon nitride microresonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate bipartite gaussian boson sampling with squeezed light in 6 mixed time-frequency modes. Non-degenerate two-mode squeezing is generated in two time-bins from a silicon nitride microresonator with simultaneous high spectral purity (&gt;0.86(3)) and indistinguishability (0.985(2)). An unbalanced interferometer embedding electro-optic modulators, which is stabilized by exploiting the continuous energy-time entanglement of the generated photon pairs, controls time and frequency-bin modes. We measure 144 collision-free events with 4 photons at the output, achieving a fidelity &gt;0.98 with the theoretical probability distribution. We use this result to identify the similarity between families of isomorphic graphs with 6 vertices, and present an approach for the realization of universal operations on time-frequency modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nodes are traditionally viewed as fixed points where the probability density vanishes. However, this work demonstrates that these nodes exhibit time-dependent oscillation in quantum superposition states. We derive this effect for a fundamental system: the 1D particle in a box. It is shown that the probability density in a superposition of two eigenstates evolves with a time-dependent interference term, introducing an oscillation of the nodes at a specific frequency equal to the energy difference between the states. This result suggests a deeper dynamical role for nodes in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast All-Optical Measurement of Squeezed Vacuum in a Lithium Niobate Nanophotonic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Between Compatibility and Deterministic Underlying States in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between the pairwise compatibility of all observables in a scenario, and our ability to create a deterministic underlying-state model for that scenario (a type of hidden-variable model, typically used in the contextuality and nonlocality literature, where quantum states are treated as probability measures over ``better-defined states''). We first argue that the quantum state update rule implies that underlying-state models must update their states in agreement with the rules of conditional probability. We then demonstrate that deterministic underlying-state models meeting this criterion exist if and only if the system's observables are pairwise compatible, which is equivalent to the theoretical predictions of sequential measurements being independent of measurement order.</description>

      <title>Gaussian quantum data hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum data hiding encodes a hidden classical bit to a pair of quantum states that is difficult to distinguish using a particular set of measurement, denoted as $M$. In this work, we explore quantum data hiding in two contexts involving Gaussian operations or states. First, we consider the set of measurement $M$ as Gaussian local quantum operations and classical communication, a new set of operations not previously discussed in the literature for data hiding. We hide one classical bit in the two different mixture of displaced two-mode squeezed states. Second, we consider the set of measurement $M$ as general Gaussian measurement and construct the data hiding states using two-mode thermal states. This data hiding scheme is effective in the weak strength limit, providing a new example compared to existing discussions for the set of general Gaussian measurement.</description>

      <title>Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in the physical realization of quantum computing hardware in recent times, bringing us closer than ever before to realizing the promise of quantum computing. However, noise continues to pose a crucial challenge when it comes to scaling up present day quantum processors. While decoherence limits the qubits ability to store information for long periods in the presence of uncontrollable noise sources, the erroneous implementation of control methods for state preparation and measurements leads to faulty implementations of quantum circuits. Conventional noise spectroscopy protocols can characterize and model environmental noise but are usually resource intensive and lengthy. Moreover, the underlying noise can vary in nature over time, making noise profile extraction futile as this new information cannot be harnessed to improve quantum error correction or dynamical decoupling protocols. In this work, we address this challenge using a machine learning-based methodology to quickly extract noise spectra of multiple qubits and demonstrate a possible noise mitigation strategy. The procedure involves implementing undemanding dynamical decoupling sequences to record coherence decays of the investigated qubits and then predict the underlying noise spectra with the help of a convolution neural network pre-trained on a synthetic dataset. While our protocol is virtually hardware-agnostic, we validate its effectiveness using superconducting qubits available on the IBM Quantum platform. We further use these rapidly obtained, yet accurate, noise spectra to design bespoke dynamic decoupling sequences and perform time-dependent noise spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze sharing Bell-type nonlocal correlation between two distant parties with optical hybrid states comprising of a single photon polarization state and a multiphoton coherent state. By deploying entanglement swapping over the coherent state parts at the middle station, we show that the optical hybrid states can efficiently generate a polarization-entangled state that violates Clauser-Horne-Shimoni-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality well over a metropolitan distance. We further assess the quality of the shared entangled state in the information processing task of quantum teleportation of an unknown polarization qubit. Our results with realistic devices, embedding detection inefficiency and transmission losses, indicate the viability of faithful quantum teleportation over large distances, conforming with the quality of the shared correlation.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Jump Method for Driven-Dissipative Two-Level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified non-Markovian quantum jump method to overcome the obstacle of exponentially increased trajectory number in conventional quantum trajectory simulations. In our method the trajectories are classified into the trajectory classes characterized by the number of quantum jumps. We derive the expression of the existence probability of each trajectory (class) which is essential to construct the density matrix of the open quantum system. This modified method costs less computational resource and is more efficient than the conventional quantum trajectory approach. As applications we investigate the dynamics of spin-1/2 systems subject to Lorentzian reservoirs with considering only the no-jump and one-jump trajectories. The revival of coherence and entanglement induced by the memory effect is observed.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States in Field Theory: No Partial Factorization, Multi-Particle Packaging, and Hybrid Gauge-Invariant Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that local gauge invariance and superselection rules enforce a ``packaging'' principle for quantum field excitations: \textbf{internal quantum numbers (IQNs)} such as charge, color, or flavor are locked into \textbf{irreducible representation (irrep)} blocks. At the single-particle level, this packaging principle forbids the partial factorization of IQNs (e.g.\ ``half an electron charge'' or ``just the color quantum number of a quark''). Extending to multi-particle states, superselection restricts the net gauge charge to a single sector, eliminating cross-sector Bell-type superpositions while permitting packaged entangled states within one superselection sector.  We provide rigorous theorems clarifying (i)~why no partial factorization of IQNs is possible, (ii)~how multi-particle superpositions remain gauge-invariant within a single net-charge sector, and (iii)~how external \textbf{degrees of freedom (DOFs)} (spin, momentum) can be hybridized with these internal charges to form gauge-invariant entanglement. We also discuss how measurements of spin or momentum in such hybrid states lead to collapse of the internal entanglement.  The interplay of gauge constraints and superselection thus gives quantum field states a nontrivial information-theoretic structure: \textit{internal charges must be packaged with each particle's creation operator, yet multi-particle states may form entangled superpositions so long as the net charge remains consistent}.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Pure States is as Hard as Mixed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography, the task of learning an unknown quantum state, is a fundamental problem in quantum information. In standard settings, the complexity of this problem depends significantly on the type of quantum state that one is trying to learn, with pure states being substantially easier to learn than general mixed states. A natural question is whether this separation holds for any quantum state learning setting. In this work, we consider the online learning framework and prove the surprising result that learning pure states in this setting is as hard as learning mixed states. More specifically, we show that both classes share almost the same sequential fat-shattering dimension, leading to identical regret scaling under the $L_1$-loss. We also generalize previous results on full quantum state tomography in the online setting to learning only partially the density matrix, using smooth analysis.</description>

      <title>Heralded generation of entanglement with photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled states of photons form the backbone of many quantum technologies. Due to the lack of effective photon-photon interactions, the generation of these states is typically probabilistic. In the prevailing but fundamentally limited generation technique, known as postselection, the target photons are measured destructively in the generation process. By contrast, in the alternative approach -- heralded state generation -- the successful creation of a desired state is verified by the detection of ancillary photons. Heralded state generation is superior to postselection in several critical ways: It enables free usage of the prepared states, allows for the success probability to be arbitrarily increased via multiplexing, and provides a scalable route to quantum information processing using photons. Here, we review theoretical proposals and experimental realizations of heralded entangled photonic state generation, as well as the impact of realistic experimental errors. We then discuss the wide-ranging applications of these states for quantum technologies, including resource states in linear optical quantum computing, entanglement swapping for repeater networks, fundamental physics, and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code switching to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state in a condensed $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code, which enables the implementation of a logical $T$ gate in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding code switching between topological codes.</description>

      <title>Noise-resilient host for electron qubit operation up to 0.4 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid-state material platform for hosting single electron qubits. At temperatures of $\sim$10 mK, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have shown exceptionally long coherence times and high single-qubit gate fidelities. Further expanding the capabilities of this platform to multiple qubits in a scalable fashion will require careful understanding and the corresponding optimization of the underlying noise environment. Here, we demonstrate the remarkable robustness enabled by the neon layer in eNe charge qubits against charge and thermal noise by operating them away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimization, the measured charge (voltage) noise spectral density on neon is comparable to the best in conventional gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots. Up to 0.4 K, the qubit coherence time with dynamical decoupling can still reach the relaxation limit of $\sim$1 microsecond. These observations highlight the potential of solid neon to facilitate a quiet charge environment and eNe qubits' potential for higher-temperature operation in a scaled-up system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the sensitive dependence of a giant atom's radiation rate on its frequency [A. F. Kockum, $et~al$., Phys. Rev. A 90, 013837 (2014)], we propose an effective magnetometer model based on single giant emitter. In this model, the emitter's frequency is proportional to the applied bias magnetic field. The self-interference effect causes the slope of the dissipation spectrum to vary linearly with the number of emitter-coupling points. The giant emitter magnetometer achieves a sensitivity as high as $10^{-8}-10^{-9}\,{\rm T/\sqrt{Hz}}$, demonstrating the significant advantages of the self-interference effect compared to small emitters. We hope our proposal will expand the applications of giant emitters in precision measurement and magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Near-deterministic photon entanglement from a spin qudit in silicon using third quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum phase transitions monitored by current fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions (DPT) are defined by sudden changes in the physical properties of nonequilibrium open quantum systems and they present characteristics that have no analogue in closed and thermal systems. Several methods to detect and characterize DPT have been suggested in the literature, the most famous of which -- the $\textit{Liouvillian gap}$ -- can be derived from a spectral analysis of the Liouvillian super-operator that governs the complex interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics. Here, we consider the $\textit{output current}$, defined as the average total quantum jumps per unit time between the open quantum system and the environment. We propose that output current fluctuations, and in particular their dynamical correlations, their power spectrum, and their characteristic timescale can provide valuable information about DPT, confirming a dramatic change of behavior at the critical point. We validate our proposal using the dissipative XYZ model and the nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr model, showing good agreement with previous estimates of the location of the critical point. Compared to previous approaches, our proposal could be already experimentally tested in optical systems, providing a practical method to detect criticality in quantum open systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable, nanoscale positioning of highly coherent color centers in prefabricated diamond nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonic devices in color center-containing hosts provide efficient readout, control, and entanglement of the embedded emitters. Yet control over color center formation - in number, position, and coherence - in nanophotonic devices remains a challenge to scalability. Here, we report a controlled creation of highly coherent diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers with nanoscale three-dimensional localization in prefabricated nanostructures with high yield. Combining nitrogen $\delta$-doping during chemical vapor deposition diamond growth and localized electron irradiation, we form shallow NVs registered to the center of diamond nanopillars with wide tunability over NV number. We report positioning precision of ~ 4 nm in depth and 46(1) nm laterally in pillars (102(2) nm in bulk diamond). We reliably form single NV centers with long spin coherence times (average $T_2^{Hahn}$ = 98 $\mu s$) and 1.8x higher average photoluminescence compared to NV centers randomly positioned in pillars. We achieve a 3x improved yield of NV centers with single electron-spin sensitivity over conventional implantation-based methods. Our high-yield defect creation method will enable scalable production of solid-state defect sensors and processors.</description>

      <title>A two-disk approach to the synthesis of coherent passive equalizers for linear quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent equalization problem consists in designing a quantum system acting as a mean-square near optimal filter for a given quantum communication channel. The paper develops an improved method for the synthesis of transfer functions for such equalizing filters, based on a linear quantum system model of the channel. The method draws on a connection with the two-disk problem of ${H}_{\infty}$ control for classical (i.e., nonquantum) linear uncertain systems. Compared with the previous methods, the proposed method applies to a broader class of linear quantum communication channels.</description>

      <title>Developing universal logical state-purification strategy for quantum error correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a measurement-based protocol for simultaneously purifying arbitrary logical states in multiple quantum error correcting codes with unit fidelity and finite probability, starting from arbitrary thermal states of each code. The protocol entails a time evolution caused by an engineered Hamiltonian, which results in transitions between the logical and error subspaces of the quantum error correcting code mediated by the auxiliary qubit, followed by a projective measurement in an optimum basis on the auxiliary qubit and an appropriate post-selection of the measurement outcomes. We illustrate the results with the three-qubit repetition code and the logical qubit used in quantum state transfer protocol. We further demonstrate that when the measurement base is not optimal, it is possible to achieve both classical fidelity, and fidelity as high as $90\%$ through several iterations of the purifying procedure, thereby establishing its robustness against variations in the measurement basis. By repeating the purification rounds, we show that purifying the cardinal states of the logical Bloch sphere corresponding to logical qubits in quantum state transfer is feasible utilizing paradigmatic quantum spin models as the generator of the time evolution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference in Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interference takes center stage in the realm of quantum particles, playing a crucial role in revealing their wave-like nature and probabilistic behavior. It relies on the concept of superposition, where the probability amplitudes of different processes that contribute to the given phenomenon interfere with each other. When combined, their phases can interfere either constructively or destructively. Quantum interference manifests in three distinct forms: optical interference, arising from the interaction of light waves and forming the basis for technologies such as lasers and optical filters. Interference via atoms involves manipulating atomic states to control light interaction, enabling techniques like Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage STIRAP and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency EIT in quantum information processing. Finally, self-interference of atoms occurs when matter waves associated with individual atoms interfere with themselves, enabling precise measurements in atom interferometry, a crucial tool for fields like quantum mechanics and navigation. These diverse forms of quantum interference have profound implications for numerous scientific disciplines, demonstrating its ability to encompass all quantum particles, not just light.</description>

      <title>Performance of quantum annealing for 2-SAT problems with multiple satisfying assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a specially constructed set of hard 2-SAT problems with four satisfying assignments, we study the scaling and sampling performance of numerical simulation of quantum annealing as well as that of the physical quantum annealers offered by D-Wave. To this end, we use both the standard quantum annealing and reverse annealing protocols in both our simulations and on the D-Wave quantum annealer. In the case of ideal quantum annealing the sampling behavior can be explained by perturbation theory and the scaling behavior of the time to solution depends on the scaling behavior of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the annealing Hamiltonian. The corresponding results from the D-Wave quantum annealers do not fit to this ideal picture, but suggest that the scaling of the time to solution from the quantum annealers matches those calculated from the equilibrium probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Hybrid sub- and superradiant states in emitter arrays with quantized motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembles of dipolar emitters which couple collectively to the radiation field display sub- and superradiance. These terms refer to a reduction or an enhancement of photon emission rates due to the interference of emission channels. Arrays of trapped neutral atoms constitute a promising platform for harnessing this phenomenon in technological applications, e.g. for excitation storage, single-photon switches and mirrors. However, vibrational motion of the atoms within their traps leads to position fluctuations that entangle the motion and the internal atomic degrees of freedom, which is expected to affect the collective photon emission. We develop here a theory for collective atom-light coupling in the presence of this quantized motion within the Lamb-Dicke limit. We show the existence of sub- and superradiant states, which are hybrids of electronic and vibrational excitations and explore their properties for analytically and numerically efficiently solvable cases.</description>

      <title>Efficient evaluation of the nonstabilizerness in unitary and monitored quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the staggered XXZ chain, also focusing on its noninteracting tight-binding limit, and of the SYK model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). To do that we introduce a numerical method to evaluate SRE, more efficient than the brute-force one, based on the expansion of the state restricted to a subspace in the computational basis of the classical spin configurations. In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one where the time-averaged SRE saturates the fully-random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the asymptotic SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the asymptotic SRE linearly increases with the size in all the considered cases.</description>

      <title>On Exact Space-Depth Trade-Offs in Multi-Controlled Toffoli Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the optimized implementation of Multi Controlled Toffoli (MCT) using the Clifford $+$ T gate sets. While there are several recent works in this direction, here we explicitly quantify the trade-off (with concrete formulae) between the Toffoli depth (this means the depth using the classical 2-controlled Toffoli) of the $n$-controlled Toffoli (hereform we will tell $n$-MCT) and the number of clean ancilla qubits. Additionally, we achieve a reduced Toffoli depth (and consequently, T-depth), which is an extension of the technique introduced by Khattar et al. (2024). In terms of a negative result, we first show that using such conditionally clean ancilla techniques, Toffoli depth can never achieve exactly $\ceil{\log_2 n}$, though it remains of the same order. This highlights the limitation of the techniques exploiting conditionally clean ancilla [Nie et al., 2024, Khattar et al., 2024]. Then we prove that, in a more general setup, the T-Depth in the Clifford + T decomposition, via Toffoli gates, is lower bounded by $\ceil{\log_2 n}$, and this bound is achieved following the complete binary tree structure. Since the ($2$-controlled) Toffoli gate can further be decomposed using Clifford $+$ T, various methodologies are explored too in this regard for trade-off related implications.</description>

      <title>Operationally classical simulation of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical state-preparation device cannot generate superpositions and hence its emitted states must commute. Building on this elementary observation, we introduce a notion of operationally classical models in which many such devices can be stochastically coordinated for the purpose of simulating quantum states. This leads to many non-commuting quantum state ensembles admitting a classical model. We develop systematic methods both for classically simulating quantum ensembles and for showing that no such simulation exists, thereby certifying quantum coherence. In particular, we determine the exact noise rates required to classically simulate the entire state space of quantum theory. We also reveal connections between the operational classicality of ensembles and the well-known fundamental concepts of joint measurability and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Our approach is a possible avenue to understand how and to what extent quantum states defy generic models based on classical devices, which also has relevant implications for quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Metrology by Quantum Resonance Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum effects in metrology can in principle enhance measurement precision from the so-called standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg Limit. Further advancements in quantum metrology largely rely on innovative metrology protocols that can avoid a number of known obstacles, including the challenge of preparing entangled states with sufficient fidelity, the readout noise in measuring highly entangled states, and no-go theorems for quantum metrology under noisy environments. In this Letter, exploiting some peculiar but experimentally feasible dynamical features of a collection of spins with all-to-all time-periodic interactions, we propose a metrology protocol that can circumvent all the three mentioned obstacles and yet still make good use of time as a resource for metrology. Specifically, by mapping the dynamics of such a periodically driven spin system to that of a paradigm of quantum chaos but tuned to some high-order quantum resonance, it is shown that a simple $SU(2)$ coherent state can, after evolving to highly entangled states in the ensuing dynamics, be dynamically brought back to the same initial coherent state. The associated quantum Fisher information is found to exhibit quadratic scaling with both the number of spins and the duration of the metrology protocol. The achieved Heisenberg scaling can also largely survive in the presence of Markovian noise. Representing a previously unknown strategy for quantum metrology, the protocol proposed here can be tested on available experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Predicting symmetries of quantum dynamics with optimal samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying symmetries in quantum dynamics, such as identity or time-reversal invariance, is a crucial challenge with profound implications for quantum technologies. We introduce a unified framework combining group representation theory and subgroup hypothesis testing to predict these symmetries with optimal efficiency. By exploiting the inherent symmetry of compact groups and their irreducible representations, we derive an exact characterization of the optimal type-II error (failure probability to detect a symmetry), offering an operational interpretation for the quantum max-relative entropy. In particular, we prove that parallel strategies achieve the same performance as adaptive or indefinite-causal-order protocols, resolving debates about the necessity of complex control sequences. Applications to the singleton group, maximal commutative group, and orthogonal group yield explicit results: for predicting the identity property, Z-symmetry, and T-symmetry of unknown qubit unitaries, with zero type-I error and type-II error bounded by $\delta$, we establish the explicit optimal sample complexity which scales as $\mathcal{O}(\delta^{-1/3})$ for identity testing and $\mathcal{O}(\delta^{-1/2})$ for T/Z-symmetry testing. These findings offer theoretical insights and practical guidelines for efficient unitary property testing and symmetry-driven protocols in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>100 Particles Quantum Heat Engine: Exploring the Impact of Criticality on Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems present substantial technical challenges from both analytical and numerical perspectives. Despite these difficulties, some progress has been made, including studies of interacting atomic gases and interacting quantum spins. Furthermore, the potential for criticality to enhance engine performance has been demonstrated, suggesting a promising direction for future investigation. Here, we explore the performance of a quantum Otto cycle using a long-range Ising chain as the working substance. We consider an idealized cycle consisting of two adiabatic transformations and two perfect thermalizations, eliminating dissipation. Analyzing both engine and refrigerator modes, we investigate the influence of particle number, varied from $10$ to $100$, on efficiencies and behavior near the critical point of the phase transition, which we characterize using a scaling factor. We also examine how internal factors, specifically, the power-law exponent, the number of particles, and the hot and cold reservoir temperatures, affect the system's operation in different modes. Our results reveal that these factors have a different impact compared to their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Two-particle quantum interference in a nonlinear optical medium: a witness of timelike indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect is a paradigmatic quantum phenomenon demonstrating the interference of two indistinguishable photons that are linearly coupled at a 50:50 beam splitter. Here, we transpose such a two-particle quantum interference effect to the nonlinear regime, when two single photons are impinging on a parametric down-conversion crystal. Formally, this transposition amounts to exchanging space and time variables, giving rise to an unknown form of timelike quantum interference. The two-photon component of the output state is a superposition of the incident photons being either transmitted or reborn, that is, replaced by indistinguishable substitutes due to their interaction with the nonlinear crystal. We experimentally demonstrate the suppression of the probability of detecting precisely one photon pair when the amplification gain is tuned to 2, which arises from the destructive interference between the transmitted and reborn photon pairs. This heretofore unobserved quantum manifestation of indistinguishability in time pushes nonlinear quantum interference towards a new regime with multiple photons. Hence, composing this effect with larger linear optical circuits should provide a tool to generate multimode quantum non-Gaussian states, which are essential resources for photonic quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quandaries: Unraveling Encoding Vulnerabilities in Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionize fields like machine learning, security, and healthcare. Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising area, enhancing learning algorithms using quantum computers. However, QML models are lucrative targets due to their high training costs and extensive training times. The scarcity of quantum resources and long wait times further exacerbate the challenge. Additionally, QML providers may rely on third party quantum clouds for hosting models, exposing them and their training data to potential threats. As QML as a Service (QMLaaS) becomes more prevalent, reliance on third party quantum clouds poses a significant security risk. This work demonstrates that adversaries in quantum cloud environments can exploit white box access to QML models to infer the users encoding scheme by analyzing circuit transpilation artifacts. The extracted data can be reused for training clone models or sold for profit. We validate the proposed attack through simulations, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between encoding schemes. We report that 95% of the time, the encoding can be predicted correctly. To mitigate this threat, we propose a transient obfuscation layer that masks encoding fingerprints using randomized rotations and entanglement, reducing adversarial detection to near random chance 42% , with a depth overhead of 8.5% for a 5 layer QNN design.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results therefore suggest that non-stabilizerness allows to sharply detect many-body quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Quantum work statistics across a critical point: full crossover from sudden quench to the adiabatic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Additivity and chain rules for quantum entropies via multi-index Schatten norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary entropic measures for quantum states are additive under the tensor product. In the analysis of quantum information processing tasks, the minimum entropy of a set of states, e.g., the minimum output entropy of a channel, often plays a crucial role. A fundamental question in quantum information and cryptography is whether the minimum output entropy remains additive under the tensor product of channels. Here, we establish a general additivity statement for the optimized sandwiched R\'enyi entropy of quantum channels. For that, we generalize the results of [Devetak, Junge, King, Ruskai, CMP 2006] to multi-index Schatten norms. As an application, we strengthen the additivity statement of [Van Himbeeck and Brown, 2025] thus allowing the analysis of time-adaptive quantum cryptographic protocols. In addition, we establish chain rules for R\'enyi conditional entropies that are similar to the ones used for the generalized entropy accumulation theorem of [Metger, Fawzi, Sutter, Renner, CMP 2024].</description>

      <title>A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</description>

      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Excitation and Spin Pumping of Chirally Coupled Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an integrated semiconductor chip where a single quantum dot (QD) is excited in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through its nearest p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables high directionality (greater than or equal to 0.95) across approximately 56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, local excitation methods using an out-of-plane excitation beam focused directly over the area of the QD achieve only approximately 25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, enabling the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with greater than 90% directionality. The remote p-shell excitation protocol establishes a new benchmark for waveguide quantum optics in terms of the combination of Purcell enhancement and high directionality, thereby paving the way for on-chip excitation of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in regimes of high beta-factor.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure Theory with Molecular Point Group Symmetries on Quantum Annealers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry through major speedups to computation times and exponential reduction of computational resources. Here, we combine the symmetry-adapted Jordan-Wigner encoding based on the full Boolean symmetry group $\mathbb{Z}_2^k$ with our new implementation of the Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) method for improving the efficiency of electronic structure theory calculations on quantum annealers, particularly by reducing the number of qubits needed to achieve the same accuracy. By providing a more extensive symmetry-adapted encoding (SAE) than previous work, we are able to simulate molecules larger than those previously reported that have been studied using methods developed for quantum annealers and without using an active space. We calculated the potential energy surfaces of H$_2$, LiH, He$_2$, H$_2$O, O$_2$, N$_2$, Li$_2$, F$_2$, CO, BH$_3$, NH$_3$, and CH$_4$, with the largest molecule in the STO-6G basis set requiring 16 qubits with our SAE, and compared them with full configuration interaction results. The application of SAE to the XBK method provides an exponential reduction of the size of the Hilbert space and scales well with the size of the problem. It does not introduce significant additional errors for even or large values of a key variational parameter that determines the number of ancilla qubits used in the XBK method's Hamiltonian embedding, or for certain molecules such as He$_2$ and H$_2$O. We provide an explanation for this behavior and a recommendation on the usage of our method.</description>

      <title>Stress Accommodation in Nanoscale Dolan Bridges Designed for Superconducting Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are the principal circuit element in numerous superconducting quantum information devices and can be readily integrated into large-scale electronics. However, device integration at the wafer scale necessarily depends on having a reliable, high-fidelity, and high-yield fabrication method for creating Josephson junctions. When creating Al/AlOx based superconducting qubits, the standard Josephson junction fabrication method relies on a sub-micron suspended resist bridge, known as a Dolan bridge, which tends to be particularly fragile and can often times fracture during the resist development process, ultimately resulting in device failure. In this work, we demonstrate a unique Josephson junction lithography mask design that incorporates stress-relief channels. Our simulation results show that the addition of stress-relief channels reduces the lateral stress in the Dolan bridge by more than 70% for all the bridge geometries investigated. In practice, our novel mask design significantly increased the survivability of the bridge during device processing, resulting in 100% yield for over 100 Josephson junctions fabricated.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study generally non-self-adjoint realizations of the Dirac operator on an arbitrary finite metric graph. Employing the robust boundary triple framework, we derive, in particular, a variant of the Birman Schwinger principle for its eigenvalues, and with an example of a star shaped graph we show that the point spectrum may exhibit diverse behaviour. Subsequently, we find sufficient and necessary conditions on transmission conditions at the graph's vertices under which the Dirac operator on the graph is symmetric with respect to the parity, the time reversal, or the charge conjugation transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When placing an ultracold atomic gas inside a cavity, the light-matter coupling is enhanced and nonlinear atomic dynamics are generated, offering a promising platform for quantum simulation of models with short- and long-range interactions. Recently, superradiant self organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Doped resonating valence bond states: How robust are the spin ice phases in 3D Rydberg arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in 3D Rydberg arrays, here, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal-weight-superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, both the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two novel and direct quantum mechanical representations of the Black-Scholes model are constructed based on the (Wick-rotated) quantization of two specific mechanical systems. The quantum setup is achieved by means of the associated Laplace-Beltrami operator (one for each model), and not by merely applying the usual naive rule. Additionally, the clear identification of the geometric content of the underlying classical framework is exploited in order to arrive at a noncommutative quantum mechanics generalization of the Black-Scholes model. We also consider a system consisting of two degrees of freedom whose (Wick-rotated) quantization leads to a model which can be seen as related to the Merton-Garman family. This model is also generalized via noncommutative quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>Induced Berry Connection and Photonic Spin Hall Effect in Optical Dirac Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of optical Dirac theory, we present a field-theoretical model of spin-orbit interaction and photonic spin/orbit Hall effects. Our approach reformulates light propagation along helical paths as solving the Maxwell equations in a ray-based curvilinear coordinate system. This system can alternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric elements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode characterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order, the resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a uniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation coupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting as extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin angular momentum (SAM) of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture, the spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in the ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent waves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically polarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light. This distinction underscores the role of spin-orbit coupling in modifying phase accumulation.</description>

Abstract: We apply a voltage pulse to electrically excite the incompressible region of a two-dimensional electron liquid in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall state and investigate the collective excitations in both the edge and bulk via photoluminescence spectral energy shifts. Introducing an offset in the voltage pulse significantly enhances the excitation signal. Real-space and time-resolved measurements reveal the dynamics of the bulk excitations, with an estimated group velocity of approximately $3 \times 10^4$ m/s. These bulk excitations align well with the magneto-plasmon model. Our results highlight the topological link between edge and bulk states, providing a novel approach to exploring solid-state analogs of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Topological Casimir effect for fermionic condensate in AdS spacetime with compact dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate combined effects of gravitational field and spatial topology on the fermionic condensate (FC) for a massive Dirac field in locally anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime with a part of spatial dimensions compactified to a torus. For general phases in the periodicity conditions along compact dimensions the topological Casimir contribution is explicitly extracted and the renormalization is reduced to the one for purely AdS spacetime. The FC is an even periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by compact dimension with the period of flux quantum. The topological contribution vanishes on the AdS boundary and dominates in the total FC in the region near the AdS horizon. For proper lengths of compact dimensions smaller than the AdS curvature radius the influence of the gravitational field is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the FC for a locally Minkowski spacetime with compact dimensions. For large proper lengths the decay of the topological FC follows a power law for both massless and massive field, in contrast to an exponential decay in Minkowski bulk for massive fields. Applications are discussed for 2D Dirac materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the dynamics of a detector modeled by a harmonic oscillator coupled with an otherwise free quantum field in a curved spacetime in terms of covariant equations of motion leading to local observables. To achieve this, we derive and renormalize the integro-differential equation that governs the detector pointer-variable dynamics, introducing phenomenological parameters such as a dispersion coefficient and a Lamb-shift parameter. Our formal solution, expressed in terms of Green's functions, allows for the covariant, and causal analysis of induced observables on the field. This formalism can be used for instance to detect non-Gaussianities present in the field's state.</description>

      <title>Generation of photon pairs through spontaneous four-wave mixing in thin nonlinear layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are a key resource for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests flat platforms, such as ultrathin layers and metasurfaces, as sources of photon pairs. Despite the success in the demonstration of spontaneous parametric-down-conversion (SPDC) from such flat sources, there are almost no works on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) - an alternative process to generate photon pairs. Meanwhile, SFWM can be implemented in any nanostructures, including isotropic and centrosymmetric ones, which are easier to fabricate than crystalline structures needed for SPDC. Here, we investigate photon pair generation through SFWM in subwavelength layers of amorphous silicon nitride (SiN) and study the effect of nitrogen content on the rate of pair emission. By observing two-photon interference between SFWM from the SiN layers and from the fused silica substrate, we find the third-order susceptibilities of layers with different nitrogen content. Finally, we demonstrate SFWM in lithium niobate, which is a second-order nonlinear material and where the direct SFWM can coexist with a cascaded process. Our results open a path for the implementation of SFWM in resonant flat structures, such as metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuations of localized two interacting particles in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universal fluctuations of localized wavefunction in the Fock space of two interacting particles in one-dimensional disordered systems, focusing on the interplay between random potentials and random long-range interactions. By mapping the system onto a directed polymer problem, we show that random potentials alone produce correlated energies for the sites in the Fock space, giving rise to the fluctuation growth exponent 1/2. Introducing random long-range interactions alters these correlations and drives the system's fluctuations into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in (1+1)D with the exponent 1/3. To validate the universality of the observed fluctuation scaling, we study a complex directed polymer model with competing point and columnar disorder. Our results confirm that columnar disorder corresponds to on-site energies in the Fock space from the random potentials, while point disorder models the effects of random long-range interactions between the two particles. These findings provide new insights into the Fock-space perspective for examining disordered quantum many-body systems, and emphasize the critical role of disorder structure in determining the universality class of fluctuations in localized quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Extended string-net models with all anyons at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String-net models describe a vast family of topological orders in two spatial dimensions, but fail to produce all the expected anyonic excitations. Following arXiv:1502.03433, we consider an extended string-net model by attaching one tail to each plaquette of the lattice, allowing all anyons to emerge as elementary plaquette excitations for arbitrary input categories. The corresponding tube algebra is the mathematical tool needed to construct the anyons from the input category and to obtain their internal multiplicities. We use them to compute the energy level degeneracies and the partition function. In the thermodynamic limit, the latter is dominated by the trivial (vacuum) anyon, so that the topological order is destroyed at any non-zero temperature. In a finite-size system, order survives up to a finite temperature, similarly to the one-dimensional classical Ising model. We confirm this by computing thermal averages of topological projectors, Wegner-Wilson loops and the topological mutual information. The results are also generalized to models with multiple tails per plaquette.</description>

      <title>The Aharonov-Bohm effect for a constant scalar matter potential in neutrino flavour interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is one of the most surprising wonders of the quantum world. The observed solenoid effect, as well as others, shows that a particle is affected by the potential in a region in which there is no force-field. This is so through the phase of the probability amplitude. Its interpretation is debated between a physical significance of the potential versus non-locality of quantum physics with the presence of the force-field generated by the potential difference outside this region. We demonstrate that the debate is resolved with the idea of replacing spatial interference by flavour interferometry as observed in neutrino oscillations. The neutrino propagation through the crust of the Earth in current facilities is affected by a constant scalar matter potential and the phase difference is in flavour internal properties. Here we show how to signal and experimentally disentangle the phase-shift due to the potential by means of observables characteristic of its symmetry properties. The energy dependence of the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the golden transition $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ allows a clear separation of the matter component against the genuine asymmetry in the absence of the potential. These findings define, in a perfect symbiosis between quantum physics and particle physics, the path to observe in a single experiment the physical significance of the potential, the neutrino mass hierarchy and the genuine matter-antimatter asymmetry in the lepton sector.</description>

Abstract: Here, a dichotomy of particles and waves is employed in a quantum Monte Carlo calculation of interacting electrons. Through the creation and propagation of concurrent stochastic ensembles of walkers in physical space and in Hilbert space one can correctly predict the ground state and the real-time evolution of a single electron interacting with larger quantum system. It is shown that such walker ensembles can be constructed straightforwardly through a stochastic sampling (windowing) applied to the mean-field approximation. Our calculations reveal that the ground state and the real-time evolution of the probability distributions and the decoherence due to the Coulomb interaction in presence of strong ultrashort laser pulse can be accounted for correctly by calculating the density matrix of the electron, without referencing to the quantum many-body state of the whole system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superposition principle provides us the opportunity to unfold many surprising facts. One such fact leads to the generation of entanglement which may allow one to teleport an unknown quantum state from one location to another. We try to understand the role of superposition in the process of quantum teleportation. We consider, within the scenario of quantum teleportation, a set-up where the sender and the receiver are in a superposed situation of using a maximally entangled state and not using any entangled state in the teleportation protocol, controlled by a qubit. We address two distinct protocols: in the first case, the sender and the receiver do nothing when they do not have the authority to use entanglement, while in the second case, they still use classical communication even if they do not use entanglement. After accomplishing the protocols, we operate a Hadamard gate on the control qubit, measure the control qubit's state, and consider the outcome corresponding to a particular state of the control. We compare the protocol's fidelity with the maximum fidelity achievable through classical resources only. In particular, we provide conditions to achieve nonclassical fidelity in teleportation, in the presence of the control qubit. To explore if there is any quantum advantage (advantage of superposition present in the control qubit), we compare the fidelities of the control qubit-based protocols with the fidelity achieved in a situation where the two parties are in a classical mixture of using and not using the maximally entangled state. We observe that there exists a wide range of parameters defining the initial state of the control qubit for which our protocols provide quantum advantage. To analyse the role of superposition quantitatively, we discuss whether the amount of quantum advantage can be expressed in terms of quantum coherence present in the state of the control qubit.</description>

      <title>Cost of Simulating Entanglement in Steering Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, yet certain entangled states that are unsteerable can be classically simulated in steering scenarios, making them unable to exhibit non-locality in quantum steering. Despite their significance, a systematic comparison of such entangled states has not been fully explored. In this work, we quantify the resource content of unsteerable quantum states in terms of the amount of shared randomness required to simulate their dynamical behavior in the steering scenario. We rigorously demonstrate that the simulation cost is unbounded even for some two-qubit unsteerable states. Moreover, the simulation cost of entangled two-qubit states is always strictly greater than that for any separable state. \par
  A significant portion of our results rely on the relationship between the simulation cost of two-qubit Werner states and that of noisy spin measurements. Using noisy spin measurements as a central example, we investigate the minimal number of outcomes required for a parent measurement to simulate a given set of compatible measurements. Although some continuous sets of measurements can be simulated using a finite-outcome parent, we identify scenarios where the simulation cost diverges. Our results provide previously unknown lower bounds on the simulation cost, supported by connections between the simulation cost of noisy spin measurements and various geometric inequalities, including those studied in the zonotope-approximation problem in Banach space theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15475v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Universal approximation theorems are the foundations of classical neural networks, providing theoretical guarantees that the latter are able to approximate maps of interest. Recent results have shown that this can also be achieved in a quantum setting, whereby classical functions can be approximated by parameterised quantum circuits. We provide here precise error bounds for specific classes of functions and extend these results to the interesting new setup of randomised quantum circuits, mimicking classical reservoir neural networks. Our results show in particular that a quantum neural network with $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ weights and $\mathcal{O} (\lceil \log_2(\varepsilon^{-1}) \rceil)$ qubits suffices to achieve accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ when approximating functions with integrable Fourier transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, and CO$_2$, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.</description>

Abstract: We investigate for optimal photon absorption a quantum electrodynamical model of an inhomogeneously-broadened spin ensemble coupled to a single-mode cavity. Solutions to this problem under experimental assumptions are developed in the Schr\"odinger picture without using perturbation theory concerning the cavity-spin interactions. Furthermore, we exploit the possibility of modulating the frequency and coupling rate of the resonator. We consider a one-photon input pulse and show some optimal scenarios, where exact formulas and numerical results are obtained for the absorption probabilities and the optimal pulse shapes. In particular, if the external loss dominates the internal loss of the cavity, we find the optimal cooperativity for different parameters and identify cases where absorption with a success probability larger than $99\%$ is achieved.</description>

Abstract: The frontier of quantum computing (QC) simulation on classical hardware is quickly reaching the hard scalability limits for computational feasibility. Nonetheless, there is still a need to simulate large quantum systems classically, as the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are yet to be considered fault tolerant and performant enough in terms of operations per second. Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. The exponential memory requirement of state vector simulation, when compared to the qubit register sizes of currently available quantum computers, quickly saturates the capacity of the top HPC machines currently available. Tensor network contraction approaches, which encode quantum circuits into tensor networks and then contract them over an output bit string to obtain its probability amplitude, still fall short of the inherent complexity of finding an optimal contraction path, which maps to a max-cut problem on a dense mesh, a notably NP-hard problem.
  This article aims at investigating the limits of current state-of-the-art simulation techniques on a test bench made of eight widely used quantum subroutines, each in 31 different configurations, with special emphasis on performance. We then correlate the performance measures of the simulators with the metrics that characterise the benchmark circuits, identifying the main reasons behind the observed performance trend. From our observations, given the structure of a quantum circuit and the number of qubits, we highlight how to select the best simulation strategy, obtaining a speedup of up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of quantum error correction strategies for the heavy-hexagonal lattice</title>

Abstract: Topological quantum error correction is a milestone in the scaling roadmap of quantum computers, which targets circuits with trillions of gates that would allow running quantum algorithms for real-world problems. The square-lattice surface code has become the workhorse to address this challenge, as it poses milder requirements on current devices both in terms of required error rates and small local connectivities. In some platforms, however, the connectivities are kept even lower in order to minimise gate errors at the hardware level, which limits the error correcting codes that can be directly implemented on them. In this work, we make a comparative study of possible strategies to overcome this limitation for the heavy-hexagonal lattice, the architecture of current IBM superconducting quantum computers. We explore two complementary strategies: the search for an efficient embedding of the surface code into the heavy-hexagonal lattice, as well as the use of codes whose connectivity requirements are naturally tailored to this architecture, such as subsystem-type and Floquet codes. Using noise models of increased complexity, we assess the performance of these strategies for IBM devices in terms of their error thresholds and qubit footprints. An optimized SWAP-based embedding of the surface code is found to be the most promising strategy towards a near-term demonstration of quantum error correction advantage.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the energy of a cavity by observing the emission of a repeatedly excited qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of excitations in a large quantum system (harmonic oscillator or qudit) can be measured in a quantum nondemolition manner using a dispersively coupled qubit. It typically requires a series of qubit pulses that encode various binary questions about the photon number. Recently, a method based on the fluorescence measurement of a qubit driven by a train of identical pulses was introduced to track the photon number in a cavity, hence simplifying its monitoring and raising interesting questions about the measurement backaction of this scheme. A first realization with superconducting circuits demonstrated how the average number of photons could be measured in this way. Here we present an experiment that reaches single-shot photocounting and number tracking owing to a cavity decay rate 4 orders of magnitude smaller than both the dispersive coupling rate and the qubit emission rate. An innovative notch filter and pogo-pin-based galvanic contact makes possible these seemingly incompatible features. The qubit dynamics under the pulse train is characterized. We observe quantum jumps by monitoring the photon number via the qubit fluorescence as photons leave the cavity one at a time. Additionally, we extract the measurement rate and induced dephasing rate and compare them to theoretical models. Our method could be applied to quantum error correction protocols on bosonic codes or qudits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized version of the Arthurs-Kelly inequality is derived when the initial state is a tripartite separable state. When each initial substate obeys the minimal uncertainty, the generalized version reduces to the well-known inequality, i.e. twice of the Heisenberg uncertainty. If the initial probe state is entangled, it is shown that the generalized version of the Arthurs-Kelly inequality can be violated. We show the violation explicitly by introducing a special example.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry from entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement.
  We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</description>

Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and $q=4$ (quartic interactions) which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k\ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms times 1/$N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{3/2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{6}$ gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model and simulate real-time dynamics up to scrambling time.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By formulating the axioms of quantum mechanics, von Neumann also laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory". As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of quantum mechanics was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  This work argues in favor of the latter position. In particular, it shows how to construct a mathematically rigorous theory for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, which is based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables. Though this theory is provably distinct from its quantum mechanical analog, it nonetheless reproduces central predictions of the latter. Further work may make an empirical comparison possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4, 043057 (2022)]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian encoding algorithms for extracting quantum control mechanism as interfering pathway amplitudes in the Dyson series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian encoding is a methodology for revealing the mechanism behind the dynamics governing controlled quantum systems. In this paper, following Mitra and Rabitz [Phys. Rev. A 67, 033407 (2003)], we define mechanism via pathways of eigenstates that describe the evolution of the system, where each pathway is associated with a complex-valued amplitude corresponding to a term in the Dyson series. The evolution of the system is determined by the constructive and destructive interference of these pathway amplitudes. Pathways with similar attributes can be grouped together into pathway classes. The amplitudes of pathway classes are computed by modulating the Hamiltonian matrix elements and decoding the subsequent evolution of the system rather than by direct computation of the individual terms in the Dyson series. The original implementation of Hamiltonian encoding was computationally intensive and became prohibitively expensive in large quantum systems. This paper presents two new encoding algorithms that calculate the amplitudes of pathway classes by using techniques from graph theory and algebraic topology to exploit patterns in the set of allowed transitions, greatly reducing the number of matrix elements that need to be modulated. These new algorithms provide an exponential decrease in both computation time and memory utilization with respect to the Hilbert space dimension of the system. To demonstrate the use of these techniques, they are applied to two illustrative state-to-state transition problems.</description>

      <title>Readout Error Mitigation for Mid-Circuit Measurements and Feedforward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current quantum computing platforms suffer from readout errors, where faulty measurement outcomes are reported by the device. These errors are particularly harmful in quantum programs that rely on branch statements wherein operations in later parts of the program are dynamically determined by mid-circuit measurements. We propose a general protocol for mitigating mid-circuit measurement errors in the presence of feedforward, offering an efficient solution that works for any number of feedforward layers without increasing circuit depth or two-qubit gate counts, making it highly suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our method demonstrates up to a ${\sim} 60\%$ reduction in error on superconducting quantum processors across several practically relevant feedforward circuits, including dynamic qubit resets, shallow-depth GHZ state preparation, and multi-stage quantum teleportation. This work paves the way for more resilient adaptive quantum circuits, crucial for both current and future quantum computing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A periodically-driven superconducting nonlinear resonator can implement a Kerr-cat qubit, which provides a promising route to a quantum computer with a long lifetime. However, the system is vulnerable to pure dephasing, which causes unwanted excitations outside the qubit subspace. Therefore, we require a refrigeration technology which confines the system in the qubit subspace. We theoretically study on-chip refrigeration for Kerr-cat qubits based on photon-assisted electron tunneling at tunneling junctions, called quantum circuit refrigerator (QCR). Rates of QCR-induced deexcitations of the system can be changed by more than four orders of magnitude by tuning a bias voltage across the tunneling junctions. Unwanted QCR-induced bit flips are greatly suppressed due to quantum interference in the tunneling process, and thus the long lifetime is preserved. The QCR can serve as a tunable dissipation source which stabilizes Kerr-cat qubits.</description>

Abstract: Can complex classical systems be designed to exhibit superpositions of tensor products of basis states, thereby mimicking quantum states? We exhibit a one-to one map between the product basis of quantum states comprising an arbitrary number of qubits and the eigenstates of a construction comprising classical oscillator networks. Specifically, we prove the existence of this map based on Cartesian products of graphs, where the graphs depict the layout of oscillator networks. We show how quantum-like gates can act on the classical networks to allow quantum-like operations in the state space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze quantum channels derived from a class of two-qubit states known as the X states. In particular, we consider X states that break the Bell's CHSH condition and then characterize the associated inverse Choi-Jamiolkowski maps, which we call nonlocality generating. Interestingly, the region corresponding to nonlocality generating channels shrinks as their stationary state departs from the maximally mixed state. Finally, we demonstrate special cases, where nonlocality can be fully characterized via as little as a single parameter. This approach significantly simplifies the analysis of nonlocality for the X states.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits are one of the most promising physical systems for implementing quantum computers. However, executing quantum algorithms of practical computational advantage requires further improvements in the fidelities of qubit operations, which are currently limited by the energy relaxation and dephasing times of the qubits. Here, we report our measurement results of a high-coherence transmon qubit with energy relaxation and echo dephasing times surpassing those in the existing literature. We measure a qubit frequency of 2.9 GHz, an energy relaxation time with a median of 425 us and a maximum of (666 +/- 33) us, and an echo dephasing time with a median of 541 us and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138) us. We report in detail our design, fabrication process, and measurement setup to facilitate the reproduction and wide adoption of high-coherence transmon qubits in the academia and industry.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Stability of emergent time periodicity in a few-body interacting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the onset and resilience of emergent time periodicity in a few-body all-to-all interacting Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where one of the constituents is locally in contact with a thermal bath. Employing both a collision model framework and a suitable time-continuous description, we show that stable time-periodic behavior can only be exhibited when the bath acts as a purely dissipative channel. We assess the role that the microscopic interactions within the system play, establishing that for the all-to-all model the introduction of temperature leads to a melting of the emergent time periodicity, in contrast to stable long-time behavior which can be maintained for nearest neighbor $XXZ$ type interactions.</description>

      <title>The controlled exciton transport of the Multi-chain system by cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accomplished functions of a variety of quantum devices are closely associated with the controlling of exciton transport. To this end we study the exciton transport of the two-dimensional system consisting of two-level multichains with various coupling configurations in a cavity. Two types of the chains, the homogeneous and heterogeneous coupling chain, as well as two inter-chain coupling conformations, the square and triangle type, are considered. The effects of the inter-chain coupling, the dimerization parameter, the cavity, the length and number of the chains on exciton transport are in detail investigated for different coupling configurations through the spectra, the Hopfield coefficients, and the steady-state dynamics of the system. The results show that in the absence of cavity the exciton transport currents and efficiency are decided by the distribution of exciton on the multichains. However, when the cavity is considered the exciton transport can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by the polariton at the cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings near zero-energy modes, at which the coherent excitation and Landau-Zener transitions occur. Meanwhile, we discover that the incontinuity and extreme points of the second order partial derivative of the Hopfield coefficients of the photon with the inter-chain coupling and the dimerization parameter correspond respectively to the crossings and anticrossings at the extreme points of the photon occupation number. In addition, the exciton transport efficiency is closely related to the parity of both the length and number of the chains, which behaves as oscillation. This work is important for understanding the exciton transport mechanism in the multichain-cavity system, and provides theoretical basis for excitonic devices with controllable and efficient exciton transport.</description>

      <title>High-performance conditional-driving gate for Kerr parametric oscillator qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of using ultracold alkali diatomic molecules to implement many-body quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry. Experimentally accessible molecules offer large $N$ for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with both attractive and repulsive interactions. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations on pairs of NaK, NaRb and NaCs molecules that are shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields. We develop new methods to handle the very large basis sets required to include nuclear spins. We show that all the molecules studied have the properties required for SU($N$) symmetry: the collisions are principally elastic, and the scattering lengths depend only weakly on the spin states of the molecules. The rates of spin-changing inelastic collisions are very low. We develop and test a semiclassical model of the spin dependence and find that it performs well.</description>

      <title>Optimal State Preparation for Logical Arrays on Zoned Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to solve problems previously deemed infeasible. However, high error rates necessitate quantum error correction for practical applications. Seminal experiments with zoned neutral atom architectures have shown remarkable potential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To fully harness their potential, efficient software solutions are vital. A key aspect of quantum error correction is the initialization of physical qubits representing a logical qubit in a highly entangled state. This process, known as state preparation, is the foundation of most quantum error correction codes and, hence, a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generating a schedule of target-specific instructions to perform the state preparation is highly complex. First software tools exist but are not suitable for the zoned neutral atom architectures. This work addresses this gap by leveraging the computational power of SMT solvers and generating minimal schedules for the state preparation of logical arrays. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that actively utilizing zones to shield idling qubits consistently results in higher fidelities than solutions disregarding these zones. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap/tree/main/src/na/nasp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework to understand quantum friction across distinct stability regimes, providing approximate expressions for frictional forces both in the deep stable regime and near the critical threshold of instability. Our primary finding is analytical proof that, near the instability threshold, the quantum friction force diverges logarithmically. This result, verified through numerical simulations, sheds light on the behavior of frictional instabilities as the system approaches criticality.
  Our findings offer new insights into the role of instabilities, critical divergence and temperature in frictional dynamics across quantum and classical regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum key distribution with imperfectly isolated devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) assume that there is no unwanted information leakage about the state preparation process. However, this assumption is impossible to guarantee in practice, as QKD systems can leak information to the channel due to device imperfections or the active action of an eavesdropper. Here, we solve this pressing issue by introducing a security proof in the presence of information leakage from all state preparation settings for arguably the most popular QKD scheme, namely the decoy-state BB84 protocol. The proof requires minimal experimental characterization, as only a single parameter related to the isolation of the source needs to be determined, thus providing a clear path for bridging the gap between theory and practice. Moreover, if information about the state of the side channels is available, this can be readily incorporated into the analysis to further improve the resulting performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) allows sharing secret keys among multiple distant users and plays a crucial role in quantum networks. Because of the fragility and low generation rate of genuine multipartite entangled states required in QCC, realizing and extending QCC with the entanglement-based protocol is challenging. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) QCC, which removes all detector side channels, is a feasible long-distance quantum communication scheme to practically generate multipartite correlation with multiphoton projection measurement. Here we experimentally realize the three-user MDIQCC protocol with four-intensity decoy-state method, in which we employ the polarization encoding and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state projection measurement. Our work demonstrates the experimental feasibility of the MDI QCC, which lays the foundation for the future realization of quantum networks with multipartite communication tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithmic framework for simulating linear, anti-Hermitian (lossless) wave equations in heterogeneous, anisotropic, and time-independent media. This framework encompasses a broad class of wave equations, including the acoustic wave equation, Maxwell$'$s equations and the elastic wave equation. Our formulation is compatible with standard numerical discretization schemes and allows for the efficient implementation of multiple practically relevant time- and space-dependent sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that subspace energies can be extracted and wave fields compared through an $l_2$ loss function, achieving optimal precision scaling with the number of samples taken. Additionally, we introduce techniques for incorporating boundary conditions and linear constraints that preserve the anti-Hermitian nature of the equations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian simulation algorithm, our framework achieves a quartic speed-up over classical solvers in 3D simulations, under conditions of sufficiently global measurements and compactly supported sources and initial conditions. This quartic speed-up is optimal for time-domain solutions, as the Hamiltonian of the discretized wave equations has local couplings. In summary, our framework provides a versatile approach for simulating wave equations on quantum computers, offering substantial speed-ups over state-of-the-art classical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a quantum cellular automata model of fermions in discrete spacetime which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a rigorous and systematic theory for statistics independent to topological order and field theory. Additionally, we propose several conjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer program for computing statistics, which has yielded results consistent with traditional physical theories.</description>

      <title>Wave function evolution from source to detection and the measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates through free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to a detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We consider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of the wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the detection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the slits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function evolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the vertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an approximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the function characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows wider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally collapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope of this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits. Hence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the Schroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is narrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit, where it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is lost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase information, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the y-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on the counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe the process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show this function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is closely related to the wave function.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties Versus Magic Generation in $T$-doped Random Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of complexity in deep random $N$-qubit $T$-gate doped Clifford circuits, as reflected in their spectral properties and in magic generation, characterized by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy distribution and the non-stabilizing power of the circuit. For pure (undoped) Clifford circuits, a unique periodic orbit structure in the space of Pauli strings implies peculiar spectral correlations and level statistics with large degeneracies. $T$-gate doping induces an exponentially fast transition to chaotic behavior, described by random matrix theory. We compare these complexity indicators with magic generation properties of the Clifford+$T$ ensemble, and determine the distribution of magic, as well as the average non-stabilizing power of the quantum circuit ensemble. In the dilute limit, $N_T \ll N$, magic generation is governed by single-qubit behavior. Magic is generated in approximate quanta, increases approximately linearly with the number of $T$-gates, $N_T$, and displays a discrete distribution for small $N_T$. At $N_T\approx N$, the distribution becomes quasi-continuous, and for $N_T\gg N$ it converges to that of Haar-random unitaries, and averages to a finite magic density, $m_2$, $\lim_{N\to\infty} \langle m_2 \rangle_\text{Haar} = 1$. This is in contrast to the spectral transition, where ${\cal O} (1)$ $T$-gates suffice to remove spectral degeneracies and to induce a transition to chaotic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. Magic is therefore a more sensitive indicator of complexity.</description>

      <title>Comment on "The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces" (arXiv:2308.06669v3)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ``The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Carcassi, Calder\'on and Aidala (arXiv:2308.06669v3) is a thoughtful dissection of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics that seeks to pinpoint difficulties inherent in postulating that the physical states are elements of a Hilbert space. Its pivotal charge against Hilbert spaces is that by a change of variables, which is a change-of-basis unitary transformation, one ``can map states with finite expectation values to those with infinite ones''. In the present comment it is shown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the error is spotted. In consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes ``the expectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time" is also faulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces ``turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity'' is unsubstantiated. Two other objections to Hilbert spaces on physical grounds, both technically correct, are the isomorphism of separable Hilbert spaces and the unavoidable existence of infinite-expectation-value states. The former is of little relevance but the latter remains an issue without a fully satisfactory solution, although the evidence so far is that it is physically innocuous. All in all, while the authors' thesis that Hilbert spaces must be given up ought to be taken seriously, it seems insufficiently supported to be convincing.</description>

Abstract: A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ and W states, establishing tighter bounds ($\approx \times 14.22$ for GHZ, $\approx \times 16$ for W) on the number of measurements required for desired precision.</description>

Abstract: One of the key issues in quantum discrimination problems is understanding the extent of the advantages in discrimination performance when using resource states compared to resourceless states. We show that in any resource theory of states, which may not be convex, the extent to which the maximum average success probability can be improved in quantum channel discrimination problems without using auxiliary systems can be precisely quantified by the robustness measure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robustness measure can also quantify the improvement in channel discrimination problems that use auxiliary systems. Using these findings, resources can be fully characterized to achieve higher success probabilities than any state without the given resource in channel discrimination problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non-reciprocal scattering within the modes of a microwave frequency comb. Adjusting the pump frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of a Josephson parametric oscillator, we control constructive interference for the $m \longrightarrow \ell$ scattering processes, while concurrently achieving destructive interference for the inverse process $\ell \longrightarrow m$. We outline the methodology for realizing non-reciprocity in the context of two-mode isolation and a three-mode circulation, which we extend to multiple modes. We find good agreement between the experiments and a linearized theoretical model. Nonreciprocal scattering expands the toolset for parametric control, with the potential to engineer novel quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Strong and noise-tolerant entanglement in dissipative optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroscopic entanglement, as critical quantum resources in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth is dependent on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains unexplored. In this work, we study quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanics, realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer and a movable membrane. Such dissipative optomechanics allows to switch coherent and dissipative optomechanical coupling at will. With reliable parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power with coherent (dissipative) coupling. Further, we show that quantum entanglement generated by dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more noise-tolerant than that generated by coherent coupling. When both the coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously considered, entanglement is instead weakened due to quantum interference. Our result indicates that dissipative optomechanical coupling may be a promising path to engineer strong and noise-tolerant quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of tensor networks (TNs) to the simulation of material deformations within the framework of linear elasticity. Material simulations are essential computational tools extensively used in both academic research and industrial applications. TNs, originally developed in quantum mechanics, have recently shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their potential for exponential speedups over classical algorithms. Our study successfully employs TNs to solve linear elasticity equations with billions of degrees of freedom, achieving exponential reductions in both memory usage and computational time. These results demonstrate the practical viability of TNs as a powerful classical backend for executing quantum-inspired algorithms with significant efficiency gains. This work is based on our research conducted with IKERLAN.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

      <title>Cylindrically confined $H$ atom in magnetic field: variational cut-off factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,\hat{\bf z}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a \textit{perturbation}. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor $\big(1 - \big(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\big)^\nu\big)$, $\nu \geq 1$, appears to represent a significant improvement compared to the non-variational cut-off factors commonly employed in the literature. A phenomenon of a sharp change of $\nu-$behavior for small magnetic fields $B \lesssim 0.45\,a.u.$ with fixed radius $\rho_0 \approx 2\,a.u.$ is indicated. The dependence of the total energy $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ and the binding energy $E_b=E_b(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,a.u.$ and the magnetic field strength $B\in [0,\,1]\, a.u.$ is presented in detail. The expectation values $\langle \rho \rangle$ and $\langle|z| \rangle$, and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization. A brief discussion is provided comparing the 2D and 3D cases as well.</description>

      <title>Weak convexity of Fisher information matrix and superresolved localization of blinking sources of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group of techniques known by the general name of single-molecule localization microscopy reaches a nanometer-scale spatial resolution of point light emitters, well below the diffraction limit of the traditional microscopy. The key feature of these techniques is blinking, alternation of bright and dark states, of each emitter so that no more than one emitter is bright within the width of the point-spread function of the microscope during a time sufficient for its localization. We give a formulation of the optical part of these techniques in terms of quantum metrology, where the limit of precision is determined by the Fisher information on the emitters positions contained in the measurement data. We show that the advantage in resolution provided by making the emitters blink is a consequence of the fundamental property of Fisher information, its convexity. In particular, we prove the weak matrix convexity and the trace convexity of the Fisher information matrix -- two fundamental results in the multiparameter estimation theory. We show also that the advantage in information is inherent to the quantum state of light itself before the measurement and is related to the convexity of the quantum Fisher information matrix.</description>

Abstract: Chromatic quantum contextuality is a criterion for quantum nonclassicality characterized by (hyper)graph coloring constraints. By examining the 3-uniform Yu-Oh hypergraph -- a configuration of quantum observables -- we prove its chromatic number exceeds the classical three-color limit. This result establishes chromatic contextuality as a distinct form of quantum nonclassicality, diverging from Kochen-Specker-type arguments that rely on the absence of two-valued states. Crucially, the Yu-Oh hypergraph exhibits this behavior even when separable two-valued states exist, demonstrating that chromatic contextuality operates independently of traditional noncontextuality violations. Our findings underscore hypergraph coloring as a powerful framework for identifying quantum signatures, enriching the understanding of contextuality beyond conventional paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the charging dynamics of a frequency-modulated quantum battery (QB) placed within a dissipative cavity environment. Our study focuses on the interaction of such a battery under both weak and strong coupling regimes, employing a model in which the quantum battery and charger are represented as frequency-modulated qubits indirectly coupled through a zero-temperature environment. It is demonstrated that both the modulation frequency and amplitude are crucial for optimizing the charging process and the ergotropy of the quantum battery. Specifically, high-amplitude, low-frequency modulation significantly enhances charging performance and work extraction in the strong coupling regime. As an intriguing result, it is deduced that modulation at very low frequencies leads to the emergence of energy storage and work extraction in the weak coupling regime. Such a result can never be achieved without modulation in the weak coupling regime. These results highlight the importance of adjusting modulation parameters to optimize the performance of quantum batteries for real-world applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enhanced Optimization of Noise-Resilient Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a powerful class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms designed to approximate the ground state of a quantum system described by its Hamiltonian. VQEs hold promise for various applications, including lattice field theory. However, the inherent noise of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices poses a significant challenge for running VQEs as these algorithms are particularly susceptible to noise, e.g., measurement shot noise and hardware noise.
  In a recent work, it was proposed to enhance the classical optimization of VQEs with Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Optimization, as these machine-learning techniques are well-suited for handling noisy data. In these proceedings, we provide additional insights into this new algorithm and present further numerical experiments. In particular, we examine the impact of hardware noise and error mitigation on the algorithm's performance. We validate the algorithm using classical simulations of quantum hardware, including hardware noise benchmarks, which have not been considered in previous works. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that GP-enhanced algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art baselines, laying the foundation for future research on deploying these techniques to real quantum hardware and lattice field theory setups.</description>

Abstract: We propose to employ the amplification mechanism of Grover's search algorithm to efficiently prepare entangled states of an ensemble of qubits. The conditional change of sign employed in the algorithm can be implemented by the phase shift of photons scattered on an optical cavity hosting an atomic ensemble. We show that collective Dicke states, GHZ states, and Schr\"odinger cat superpositions of $N$ atoms may be prepared deterministically by few ($\sim N^{1/4}$) photon scattering events without individual addressing of the atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases in open quantum systems have become an exciting area of research, driven by the rising importance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms. The concept of Average Symmetry-Protected Topological (ASPT) phases extends symmetry-protected topological phases to quantum systems affected by disorder or decoherence. To identify nontrivial ASPT states, we introduce a "fidelity strange correlator" (FSC), which operates directly on a single bulk density matrix without boundaries. For nontrivial ASPT phases in one and two dimensions, we show that the FSC reveals long-range or power-law behavior. In several two-dimensional examples, we establish a link between the FSC and certain non-local correlation functions in statistical loop models with quantum corrections, enabling us to derive exact scaling exponents for the FSC. In addition, we discuss methods to measure the FSC using classical shadow tomography. Our work lays the groundwork for identifying these intriguing topological phases of matter in open quantum systems, both numerically and experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropy endows topological aspects in optical systems and furnishes a platform to explore non-Hermitian physics, which can be harnessed for the polarization-selective amplification of light. Here, we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity via polarization-controlled optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization-dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A Parity-Time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonian has been proposed to explain the emergence of a single polarization mode, essential for achieving a zero-threshold lasing condition. Additionally, intensity correlation measurements of the Stokes modes validate the coherence properties of the emitted light. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser in anisotropic microcavity can open up a new research direction exploring non-Hermitian and topological aspects of light in anisotropic two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: Energy efficiency in computation is ultimately limited by noise, with quantum limits setting the fundamental noise floor. Analog physical neural networks hold promise for improved energy efficiency compared to digital electronic neural networks. However, they are typically operated in a relatively high-power regime so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large, and the noise can be treated as a perturbation. We study optical neural networks where all layers except the last are operated in the limit that each neuron can be activated by just a single photon, and as a result the noise on neuron activations is no longer merely perturbative. We show that by using a physics-based probabilistic model of the neuron activations in training, it is possible to perform accurate machine-learning inference in spite of the extremely high shot noise (SNR ~ 1). We experimentally demonstrated MNIST handwritten-digit classification with a test accuracy of 98% using an optical neural network with a hidden layer operating in the single-photon regime; the optical energy used to perform the classification corresponds to just 0.038 photons per multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation. Our physics-aware stochastic training approach might also prove useful with non-optical ultra-low-power hardware.</description>

      <title>Higher rank antipodality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by general probability theory, we say that the set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is \emph{antipodal of rank $k$}, if for any $k+1$ elements $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}\in S$, there is an affine map from $\mathrm{conv}(S)$ to the $k$-dimensional simplex $\Delta_k$ that maps $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}$ bijectively onto the $k+1$ vertices of $\Delta_k$. For $k=1$, it coincides with the well-studied notion of (pairwise) antipodality introduced by Klee. We consider the following natural generalization of Klee's problem on antipodal sets: What is the maximum size of an antipodal set of rank $k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$? We present a geometric characterization of antipodal sets of rank $k$ and adapting the argument of Danzer and Gr\"unbaum originally developed for the $k=1$ case, we prove an upper bound which is exponential in the dimension. We show that this problem can be connected to a classical question in computer science on finding perfect hashes, and it provides a lower bound on the maximum size, which is also exponential in the dimension. By connecting rank-$k$ antipodality to $k$-neighborly polytopes, we obtain another upper bound when $k&gt;d/2$.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound on the Critical Momentum of an Impurity in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Bogoliubov-Fr\"ohlich model, we prove that an impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate forms a stable quasi-particle when the total momentum is less than its mass times the speed of sound. The system thus exhibits superfluid behavior, as this quasi-particle does not experience friction. We do not assume any infrared or ultraviolet regularization of the model, which contains massless excitations and point-like interactions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topology in Many-Body Dissipative Quantum Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional topological paramagnets protected by $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry: Properties of the boundary Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study gapless edge modes corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of two-dimensional three-state Potts paramagnets on a triangular lattice. First, we derive microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite-size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding number symmetry. As a result, one-dimensional chains with this symmetry form a model that supports gapless excitations due to its tricritical symmetry. Numerically, we show that low-energy states in the continuous limit of the edge model can be described by conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$, given by the coset $SU_k(3)/SU_k(2)$ CFT at level k=1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <title>Detecting a Fifth-Force Gauge Boson via Superconducting Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new fifth force between particles carrying $B-L$ charges is well-motivated by the intriguing $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model. The gauge boson mediator, F\'eeton, also serves as a dark matter candidate. In this letter, we propose a novel experimental design to detect the quantum phase difference caused by this fifth force using a superconducting Josephson junction. We find that the experiment has the best sensitivity to the gauge coupling when the gauge boson is within the mass range of $0.01\,$eV to $10\,$eV, which is an interesting mass region for the F\'eeton dark matter. This opens up a new avenue for the measurement of new physics at small scale below millimeter.</description>

      <title>Effective time-dependent temperature for fermionic master equations beyond the Markov and the secular approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a fermionic quantum system exchanging particles with an environment at a fixed temperature and study its reduced evolution by means of a Redfield-I equation with time-dependent (non-Markovian) coefficients. We find that the description can be efficiently reduced to a standard-form Redfield-II equation, however, with a time-dependent effective bath temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective temperature appears to be very high, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a time-local master equation, offering high accuracy at all times and preserving the crucial properties of the density matrix. It includes non-Markovian relaxation processes beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods and can be further applied to various types of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equations. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Josephson microwave photon detector operating at 0.7 K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict that the threshold detectors based on Al Josephson junctions, with critical currents below 100 nA, exhibiting a phase diffusion regime, can be exploited for the microwave photon detection both at 17 mK and 700 mK. We demonstrate a detection of two- and one-photon energies at 5 GHz with 90% and 15% efficiency and dark count time of about 0.1 s and 0.01 s, respectively. The observed weak temperature dependence of the detector's performance in the sub-kelvin range fully confirms its phase-diffusion mode of operation. On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance. These results are important for axion search experiments in the range of 5-25 GHz (20-100 $\mu$eV).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimental verification of the Newton law of gravity at small scales has been a longstanding challenge. Recently, torsion balance experiments have successfully measured gravitational force at the millimeter scale. However, testing gravity force on quantum mechanical wave function at small scales remains difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel experiment that utilizes the Josephson effect to detect the different evolution of quantum phase induced from the potential difference caused by gravity. We demonstrate that this experiment can test gravity quantum mechanically at the millimeter scale, and also has a potential to investigate the parity invariance of gravity at small scales.</description>

      <title>Unraveling-induced entanglement phase transition in diffusive trajectories of continuously monitored noninteracting fermionic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</description>

      <title>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpi\'nski gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpi\'nski gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Description of Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We outline a fundamentally quantum description of bosonic dark matter (DM) from which the conventional classical-wave picture emerges in the limit $m \ll 10~\textrm{eV}$. As appropriate for a quantum system, we start from the density matrix which encodes the full information regarding the possible measurements we could make of DM and their fluctuations. Following fundamental results in quantum optics, we argue that for DM it is most likely that the density matrix takes the explicitly mixed form of a Gaussian over the basis of coherent states. Deviations from this would generate non-Gaussian fluctuations in DM observables, allowing a direct probe of the quantum state of DM. Our quantum optics inspired approach allows us to rigorously define and interpret various quantities that are often only described heuristically, such as the coherence time or length. The formalism further provides a continuous description of DM through the wave-particle transition, which we exploit to study how density fluctuations over various physical scales evolve between the two limits and to reveal the unique behavior of DM near the boundary of the wave and particle descriptions.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities that have corresponding contraction maps and argue the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the argued completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in the Hayden-Preskill protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</description>

      <title>Generating Sets of Stochastic Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a generating set for stochastic matrices -- a subset of matrices whose repeated composition generates the entire set. Understanding such generating sets requires specifying the "indivisible elements" and "building blocks" within the set, which serve as fundamental components of the generation process. Expanding upon prior studies, we develop a framework that formalizes divisibility in the context of stochastic matrices. We provide a sufficient condition for divisibility that is shown to be necessary in dimension $n=3$, while for $n=2$, all stochastic matrices are shown to be divisible. Using these results, we construct generating sets for dimensions 2 and 3 by specifying the indivisible elements, and, importantly, we give an upper bound for the number of factors required from the generating set to produce the entire semigroup.</description>

      <title>Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</description>

      <title>Metric Field as Emergence of Hilbert Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First, we explain some ambiguities of spacetime and metric field as fundamental concepts. Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of acceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we investigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the Minkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the Minkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum. Furthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then extract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this approach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed QAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field theory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept instead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.
  In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting faces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs inherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality constraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression, reducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of 1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE 0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with angle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery rate forecasting.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations.
  The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a `digital twin' physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>
