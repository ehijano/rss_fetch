      <title>Robust convex risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the general properties of robust convex risk measures as worst-case values under uncertainty on random variables. We establish general concrete results regarding convex conjugates and sub-differentials. We refine some results for closed forms of worstcase law invariant convex risk measures under two concrete cases of uncertainty sets for random variables: based on the first two moments and Wasserstein balls.</description>

      <title>Partial Law Invariance and Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of partial law invariance, generalizing the concepts of law invariance and probabilistic sophistication widely used in decision theory, as well as statistical and financial applications. This new concept is motivated by practical considerations of decision making under uncertainty, thus connecting the literature on decision theory and that on financial risk management. We fully characterize partially law-invariant coherent risk measures via a novel representation formula. Strong partial law invariance is defined to bridge the gap between the above characterization and the classic representation formula of Kusuoka. We propose a few classes of new risk measures, including partially law-invariant versions of the Expected Shortfall and the entropic risk measures, and illustrate their applications in risk assessment under different types of uncertainty. We provide a tractable optimization formula for computing a class of partially law-invariant coherent risk measures and give a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Application of Natural Language Processing in Financial Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in financial risk detection. By constructing an NLP-based financial risk detection model, this study aims to identify and predict potential risks in financial documents and communications. First, the fundamental concepts of NLP and its theoretical foundation, including text mining methods, NLP model design principles, and machine learning algorithms, are introduced. Second, the process of text data preprocessing and feature extraction is described. Finally, the effectiveness and predictive performance of the model are validated through empirical research. The results show that the NLP-based financial risk detection model performs excellently in risk identification and prediction, providing effective risk management tools for financial institutions. This study offers valuable references for the field of financial risk management, utilizing advanced NLP techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial risk detection.</description>
