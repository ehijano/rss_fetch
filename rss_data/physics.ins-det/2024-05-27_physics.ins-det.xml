      <title>Kinetic inductance current sensor for visible to near-infrared wavelength transition-edge sensor readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors based on the superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) are used in a number of visible to near-infrared (VNIR) applications, particularly for photon-number-resolving measurements in quantum information science. To be practical for large-scale photonic quantum computing or for future spectroscopic imaging applications in astronomy, the size of VNIR TES arrays must be increased from a few pixels to many thousands. Historically, TES arrays have been read out with multiplexed superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), but the microsecond-duration pulse signals of VNIR TESs are notoriously difficult to multiplex. In this manuscript, we introduce the kinetic inductance current sensor (KICS), a more readily scalable readout technology that exploits the nonlinear kinetic inductance in a superconducting resonator to make sensitive current measurements. KICS devices can replace SQUIDs for many applications because of their ability to measure fast, high slew-rate signals, their compatibility with standard microwave frequency-division multiplexing techniques, and their relatively simple fabrication. Here, we demonstrate the readout of a VNIR TES using a KICS with $3.7$ $\text{MHz}$ of bandwidth. We measure a readout noise of $1.4$ $\text{pA}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, considerably below the TES noise at frequencies of interest, and a TES energy resolution of $(0.137 \pm 0.001)$ $\text{eV}$ at $0.8$ $\text{eV}$, comparable to resolutions observed with non-multiplexed SQUID readouts.</description>

      <title>A lightweight algorithm to model radiation damage effects in Monte Carlo events for High-Luminosity LHC experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation damage significantly impacts the performance of silicon tracking detectors in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, with signal reduction being the most critical effect. While adjusting sensor bias voltage and detection thresholds can help mitigating these effects, generating simulated data that accurately mirrors the performance evolution with the accumulation of luminosity, hence fluence, is crucial. \noindent The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have developed and implemented algorithms to correct simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events for radiation damage effects, achieving impressive agreement between collision data and simulated events. In preparation for the high-luminosity phase (HL-LHC), the demand for a faster ATLAS MC production algorithm becomes imperative due to escalating collision, events, tracks, and particle hit rates, imposing stringent constraints on available computing resources. This article outlines the philosophy behind the new algorithm, its implementation strategy, and the essential components involved. The results from closure tests will be presented; some preliminary results on computing performance will be commented too.</description>

      <title>Seamless Integration and Implementation of Distributed Contact and Contactless Vital Sign Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time vital sign monitoring is gaining immense significance not only in the medical field but also in personal health management. Facing the needs of different application scenarios of the smart and healthy city in the future, the low-cost, large-scale, scalable, and distributed vital sign monitoring system is of great significance. In this work, a seamlessly integrated contact and contactless vital sign monitoring system, which can simultaneously implement respiration and heartbeat monitoring, is proposed. In contact vital sign monitoring, the chest wall movement due to respiration and heartbeat is translated into changes in the optical output intensity of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The FBG is also an important part of radar signal generation for contactless vital sign monitoring, in which the chest wall movement is translated into phase changes of the radar de-chirped signal. By analyzing the intensity of the FBG output and phase of the radar de-chirped signal, real-time respiration and heartbeat monitoring are realized. In addition, due to the distributed structure of the system and its good integration with the wavelength-division multiplexing optical network, it can be massively scaled by employing more wavelengths. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out. Contact and contactless respiration and heartbeat monitoring of three people are simultaneously realized. During a monitoring time of 60 s, the maximum absolute measurement errors of respiration and heartbeat rates are 1.6 respirations per minute and 2.3 beats per minute, respectively. The measurement error does not have an obvious change even when the monitoring time is decreased to 5 s.</description>

      <title>A novel nuclear recoil calibration for liquid noble gas detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to many dark matter models, a potential signal registered in a detector would feature a single-scattering nuclear recoil (NR). So, it is crucial to calibrate the detector's response to NR events. The conventional calibrations implement $\sim$ keV to MeV neutrons, which can be produced by an accelerator, a neutron generator, or a radioactive source. Although the calibrating methods have been widely employed, they could be improved in several ways: (a) the incident neutron energy should be more monoenergetic, (b) the calibrating NR energy should line up with the region of interest (ROI) of the experiment, and (c) the intensity of the beam should be appropriate. In the paper, we introduce a novel NR calibration method for liquid helium detectors, in which a helium beam ($\alpha$ particles) will be implemented to calibrate the detectors. The helium beam can (i) be tuned precisely to have a jitter of $\lesssim $ 4\% (the $\alpha$ beam's kinetic energy is equivalent to the recoil energy in the conventional calibrations with fast neutrons); (ii) have an energy between $\sim$ 100 eV and tens of keV; and (iii) provide a tunable flux from nA to 100 $\mu$A, which presents convenience in beam pipe configuration to obtain a $\sim$ 100 Hz events rate so that the events pileup would be ignorable.</description>

      <title>Incident Beamline Design for a Modern Cold Triple Axis Spectrometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A modern cold triple axis spectrometer is being planned for the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Here, we describe the design of an incident beamline that will put a flux of $\sim 10^8\mathrm{\frac{n}{cm^2 s}}$ on a sample with an area of 2 cm x 2 cm. It takes current physical constraints at HFIR into account and it can accommodate both single and multiplexed analyzer-detector secondary spectrometers and large superconducting magnets. The proposed incident beamline includes a multi-channel guide with horizontal focusing, a neutron velocity selector, components to facilitate an incident beam polarization option, and a double-focusing pyrolytic graphite monochromator. This work describes the process of optimizing the guide system and monochromator and summarizes the expected performance of the incident beamline for non-polarized operation.</description>

      <title>Design, construction, and operation of a 1-ton Water-based Liquid scintillator detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water-based liquid scintillators (WbLS) are attractive neutrino detector materials because they allow us to tune the ratio of the Cherenkov and scintillation signals. Using WbLS large-scale neutrino experiments can benefit from both directional reconstruction and enhanced low-energy efficiency. Furthermore, broadening the science capability of such materials by metal doping may be better suited for water based liquid scintillators. We recently constructed and commissioned a 1-ton WbLS detector with good photosensor coverage and a capable data acquisition system. We intend to use this flexible detector system as a testbed for WbLS R&amp;D. In this paper we give an overview of the 1-ton system and provide some early analysis results.</description>

      <title>Continuously tunable uniaxial strain control of van der Waals heterostructure devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniaxial strain has been widely used as a powerful tool for investigating and controlling the properties of quantum materials. However, existing strain techniques have so far mostly been limited to use with bulk crystals. Although recent progress has been made in extending the application of strain to two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, these techniques have been limited to optical characterization and extremely simple electrical device geometries. Here, we report a piezoelectric-based \textit{in situ} uniaxial strain technique enabling simultaneous electrical transport and optical spectroscopy characterization of dual-gated vdW heterostructure devices. Critically, our technique remains compatible with vdW heterostructure devices of arbitrary complexity fabricated on conventional silicon/silicon dioxide wafer substrates. We demonstrate a large and continuously tunable strain of up to $-0.15\%$ at millikelvin temperatures, with larger strain values also likely achievable. We quantify the strain transmission from the silicon wafer to the vdW heterostructure, and further demonstrate the ability of strain to modify the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene. Our technique provides a highly versatile new method for exploring the effect of uniaxial strain on both the electrical and optical properties of vdW heterostructures, and can be easily extended to include additional characterization techniques.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of Charge-Induced Signals in Photon-Counting CZT Detectors for Medical Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon-counting detectors based on CZT are essential in nuclear medical imaging, particularly for SPECT applications. Although CZT detectors are known for their precise energy resolution, defects within the CZT crystals significantly impact their performance. These defects result in inhomogeneous material properties throughout the bulk of the detector. The present work introduces an efficient computational model that simulates the operation of semiconductor detectors, accounting for the spatial variability of the crystal properties. Our simulator reproduces the charge-induced pulse signals generated after the X/gamma-rays interact with the detector. The performance evaluation of the model shows an RMSE in the signal below 0.70%. Our simulator can function as a digital twin to accurately replicate the operation of actual detectors. Thus, it can be used to mitigate and compensate for adverse effects arising from crystal impurities.</description>
