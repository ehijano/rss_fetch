      <title>On a new definition of the B\"{a}cklund transformation in the isometric deformation of surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a generic $4$-dimensional integrable rolling distribution of contact elements with the symmetry of the tangency configuration (excluding developable seed and isotropic developable leaves) splits into an $1$-dimensional family of generic $3$-dimensional integrable rolling distributions of contact elements with the symmetry of the tangency configuration, thus introducing a new definition of the B\"{a}cklund transformation in the isometric deformation of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity formulas and Hessian of the Green function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on an assumption on the Hessian of the Green function, we derive some monotonicity formulas on nonparabolic manifolds. This assumption is satisfied on manifolds that meet certain conditions including bounds on the sectional curvature and covariant derivative of the Ricci curvature, as shown in the author's previous work \cite{P}. We also give explicit examples of warped product manifolds on which this assumption holds.</description>

      <title>Killing superalgebras in 2 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide some examples of Killing superalgebras on 2-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds within the theoretical framework established in arXiv:2409.11306. We compute the Spencer cohomology group $\mathsf{H}^{2,2}(\mathfrak{s}_-;\mathfrak{s})$ and filtered deformations of the non-chiral flat model (Euclidean and Poincar\'e) superalgebra $\mathfrak{s}$ for various squaring maps and show these arise as Killing superalgebras for (imaginary) geometric Killing and skew-Killing spinors in both Riemannian and Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Gauge Theory, Hyperbolic Geometry and Virasoro Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that the moduli space of hyperbolic metrics on the disc can be identified with the Virasoro coadjoint orbit $\mathrm{Diff}^+(S^1) / \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. The interest in this relationship has recently been revived in the study of two-dimensional JT gravity and it raises the natural question if all Virasoro orbits $\mathcal{O}$ arise as moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics. In this article, we give an affirmative answer to this question using $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge theory on a cylinder $S$: to any $L\in\mathcal{O}$ we assign a flat $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge field $A_L = (g_L)^{-1} dg_L$, and we explain how the global properties and singularities of the hyperbolic geometry are encoded in the monodromies and winding numbers of $g_L$, and how they depend on the Virasoro orbit. In particular, we show that the somewhat mysterious geometries associated with Virasoro orbits with no constant representative $L$ arise from large gauge transformations acting on standard (constant $L$ ) funnel or cuspidal geometries, shedding some light on their potential physical significance: e.g. they describe new topological sectors of two-dimensional gravity, characterised by twisted boundary conditions. Using a gauge theoretic gluing construction, we also obtain a complete dictionary between Virasoro coadjoint orbits and moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics with specified boundary projective structure.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the solution map for hyperbolic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic polynomials are monic real-rooted polynomials. By Bronshtein's theorem, the increasingly ordered roots of a hyperbolic polynomial of degree $d$ with $C^{d-1,1}$ coefficients are locally Lipschitz and this solution map ``coefficients-to-roots'' is bounded. We prove continuity of the solution map from hyperbolic polynomials of degree $d$ with $C^d$ coefficients to their increasingly ordered roots with respect to the $C^d$ structure on the source space and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structure, for all $1 \le q&lt;\infty$, on the target space. Continuity fails for $q=\infty$. As a consequence, we obtain continuity of the local surface area of the roots.</description>

      <title>Spectral estimates on hyperbolic surfaces and a necessary condition for observability of the heat semigroup on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of arXiv:2401.14977. We study the concentration properties of spectral projectors on manifolds, in connection with the uncertainty principle. In arXiv:2401.14977, the second author proved an optimal uncertainty principle for the spectral projector of the Laplacian on the hyperbolic half-plane. The aim of the present work is to generalize this condition to surfaces with hyperbolic ends. In particular, we tackle the case of cusps, in which the volume of balls of fixed radius is not bounded from below. We establish that spectral estimates hold from sets satisfying a thickness condition, with a proof based on propagation of smallness estimates of Carleman and Logunov--Malinnikova type. We also prove the converse, namely the necessary character of the thickness condition, on any smooth manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of the solution map for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we proved that the continuous roots of a monic polynomial of degree $d$ whose coefficients depend in a $C^{d-1,1}$ way on real parameters belong to the Sobolev space $W^{1,q}$ for all $1\le q&lt;d/(d-1)$. This is optimal. We obtained uniform bounds that show that the solution map ``coefficients-to-roots'' is bounded with respect to the $C^{d-1,1}$ and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structures on source and target space, respectively. In this paper, we prove that the solution map is continuous, provided that we consider the $C^d$ structure on the space of coefficients. Since there is no canonical choice of an ordered $d$-tuple of the roots, we work in the space of $d$-valued Sobolev functions equipped with a strong notion of convergence. We also interpret the results in the Wasserstein space on the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Scattering Theory for Asymptotically de Sitter Vacuum Solutions in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a definitive quantitative nonlinear scattering theory for asymptotically de Sitter solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $n\geq4$ even, which are determined by small scattering data at the spacelike asymptotic boundaries $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+.$ The case of even spatial dimension $n$ poses significant challenges compared to its odd counterpart and was left open by the previous works in the literature. Here, scattering theory is understood to mean existence and uniqueness of scattering states, asymptotic completeness, and the existence of an invertible scattering map with quantitative control on its norm. The existence and uniqueness of scattering states imply that for any small asymptotic data there exists a unique global solution to the Einstein equations, which remains close to the de Sitter metric. Asymptotic completeness is the converse statement, showing that any such solution induces asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and at $\mathscr{I}^+.$ For sufficiently small asymptotic data, we construct the scattering map $\mathscr{S}$ taking data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ to data at $\mathscr{I}^+,$ and we show that the map $\mathscr{S}$ is locally invertible and locally Lipschitz at the de Sitter data, with respect to a Sobolev-type norm.
  The scattering map result is sharp and avoids any "derivative loss", in the sense that we measure the smallness of asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$ using the same Sobolev norm. The proof of the sharp result requires a detailed analysis of the Einstein equations involving a geometric Littlewood-Paley decomposition of the solution, carried out in our companion paper.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Caratheodory Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0851</link>
      <description>arXiv:0808.0851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Caratheodory states that the number of umbilic points on a closed convex surface in ${\mathbb E}^3$ must be greater than one. In this paper we prove this for $C^{3+\alpha}$-smooth surfaces. The Conjecture is first reformulated in terms of complex points on a Lagrangian surface in $TS^2$, viewed as the space of oriented geodesics in ${\mathbb E}^3$. Here complex and Lagrangian refer to the canonical neutral Kaehler structure on $TS^2$. We then prove that the existence of a closed convex surface with only one umbilic point implies the existence of a totally real Lagrangian hemisphere in $TS^2$, to which it is not possible to attach the edge of a holomorphic disc. The main step in the proof is to establish the existence of a holomorphic disc with edge contained on any given totally real Lagrangian hemisphere. To construct the holomorphic disc we utilize mean curvature flow with respect to the neutral metric. Long-time existence of this flow is proven by a priori estimates and we show that the flowing disc is asymptotically holomorphic. Existence of a holomorphic disc is then deduced from Schauder estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.05306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the bordism group of closed 3-manifolds with positive scalar curvature (psc) metrics is trivial by explicit methods. Our constructions are derived from scalar-flat K{\"a}hler ALE surfaces discovered by Lock-Viaclovsky. Next, we study psc 4-manifolds with metric singularities along points and embedded circles. Our psc null-bordisms are essential tools in a desingularization process developed by Li-Mantoulidis. This allows us to prove a non-existence result for singular psc metrics on enlargeable 4-manifolds with uniformly Euclidean geometry. As a consequence, we obtain a positive mass theorem for asymptotically flat 4-manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature and low regularity.</description>

Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we give a new analytical proof of a theorem of C. Sabbah on integrable deformations of meromorphic connections on $\mathbb P^1$ with coalescing irregular singularities of Poincar\'e rank 1, and generalizing a previous result of B. Malgrange. In the second part of this paper, as an application, we prove that any semisimple formal Frobenius manifold (over $\mathbb C$), with unit and Euler field, is the completion of an analytic pointed germ of a Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold. In other words, any formal power series, which provides a quasi-homogenous solution of WDVV equations and defines a semisimple Frobenius algebra at the origin, is actually convergent under no further tameness assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's magnitude invariant. For closed manifolds we find a precise relation with Brylinski's beta function and therefore with classical invariants of knots and submanifolds. In the special case of compact homogeneous spaces we obtain an elementary proof that the residues of the beta function contain the same geometric information as the asymptotic expansion of the magnitude function. For general closed manifolds we use the recent pseudodifferential analysis of the magnitude operator to relate these via an interpolating polynomial family. Beyond manifolds, the relation with the Brylinski beta function allows to deduce unexpected properties of the magnitude function for the $p$-adic integers.</description>

      <title>Cyclic stratum of Frobenius manifolds, Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol\alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms, and integral representations of solutions of Quantum Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.08262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of "cyclic stratum" of a Frobenius manifold $M$. This is the set of points of the extended manifold $\mathbb C^*\times M$ at which the unit vector field is a cyclic vector for the isomonodromic system defined by the flatness condition of the extended deformed connection. The study of the geometry of the complement of the cyclic stratum is addressed. We show that at points of the cyclic stratum, the isomonodromic system attached to $M$ can be reduced to a scalar differential equation, called the "master differential equation" of $M$. In the case of Frobenius manifolds coming from Gromov-Witten theory, namely quantum cohomologies of smooth projective varieties, such a construction reproduces the notion of quantum differential equation.
  In the second part of the paper, we introduce two multilinear transforms, called "Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms", on spaces of Ribenboim formal power series with exponents and coefficients in an arbitrary finite dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra $A$. When $A$ is specialized to the cohomology of smooth projective varieties, the integral forms of the Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms are used in order to rephrase the Quantum Lefschetz Theorem. This leads to explicit Mellin-Barnes integral representations of solutions of the quantum differential equations for a wide class of smooth projective varieties, including Fano complete intersections in projective spaces.
  In the third and final part of the paper, as an application, we show how to use the new analytic tools, introduced in the previous parts, in order to study the quantum differential equations of Hirzebruch surfaces. This finally leads to the proof of Dubrovin Conjecture for all Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of classification of quasi-homogeneous formal power series providing solutions of the oriented associativity equations. Such a classification is performed by introducing a system of monodromy local moduli on the space of formal germs of homogeneous semisimple flat $F$-manifolds. This system of local moduli is well-defined on the complement of the "strictly doubly resonant" locus, namely a locus of formal germs of flat $F$-manifolds manifesting both coalescences of canonical coordinates at the origin, and resonances of their "conformal dimensions". It is shown how the solutions of the oriented associativity equations can be reconstructed from the knowledge of the monodromy local moduli via a Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff boundary value problem. Furthermore, standing on results of B.Malgrange and C.Sabbah, it is proved that any formal homogeneous semisimple flat $F$-manifold, which is not strictly doubly resonant, is actually convergent. Our semisimplicity criterion for convergence is also reformulated in terms of solutions of Losev-Manin commutativity equations, growth estimates of correlators of $F$-cohomological field theories, and solutions of open Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations.</description>

      <title>Borel $(\alpha,\beta)$-multitransforms and Quantum Leray-Hirsch: integral representations of solutions of quantum differential equations for $\mathbb P^1$-bundles</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the integration problem of the isomonodromic system of quantum differential equations ($qDE$s) associated with the quantum cohomology of $\mathbb P^1$-bundles on Fano varieties. It is shown that bases of solutions of the $qDE$ of the total space of the $\mathbb P^1$-bundle can be reconstructed from the datum of bases of solutions of the corresponding $qDE$ associated with the base space. This represents a quantum analog of the classical Leray-Hirsch theorem in the context of the isomonodromic approach to quantum cohomology. The reconstruction procedure of the solutions can be performed in terms of some integral transforms, introduced in arXiv:2005.08262, called $Borel$ $(\alpha,\beta)$-$multitransf\!orms$. We emphasize the emergence, in the explicit integral formulas, of an interesting sequence of special functions (closely related to iterated partial derivatives of the B\"ohmer-Tricomi incomplete Gamma function) as integral kernels. Remarkably, these integral kernels have a universal feature, being independent of the specifically chosen $\mathbb P^1$-bundle. When applied to projective bundles on products of projective spaces, our results give Mellin-Barnes integral representations of solutions of $qDE$s. As an example, we show how to integrate the $qDE$ of blow-up of $\mathbb P^2$ at one point via Borel multitransforms of solutions of the $qDE$ of $\mathbb P^1$.</description>
