      <title>Ultrafast non-equilibrium magnon generation and collapse of spin-orbit hybridization gaps in iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We distinguish between longitudinal and transverse spin excitations in the ultrafast response of iron by probing exchange splitting {\Delta}Eex and magnetic linear dichroism (MLD) in time- and angleresolved photoemission. Comparing spin-split partner bands at the Fermi level shows that {\Delta}Eex remains constant upon optical excitation. In contrast, the different MLD response of spin-orbitsplit valence bands reveals non-equilibrium, transverse spin dynamics. Magnon generation in Fe is ultrafast, electronic band specific, and drives the collapse of spin-orbit hybridization gaps.</description>

      <title>Mimicking Surface Plasmons with Structured Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metals such as silver support surface plasmons: electromagnetic surface excitations localised near the surface which originate from the free electrons of the metal. Surface modes are also observed on highly conducting surfaces perforated by holes. We establish a close connection between the two, showing that electromagnetic waves in both materials are governed by an effective permittivity of the same plasma form. Because the size and spacing of holes can readily be controlled on all relevant length scales, this gives the opportunity to create designer surface plasmons with almost arbitrary dispersion in frequency and in space, opening new vistas in surface plasmon optics.</description>

Abstract: Using the freedom of design which metamaterials provide, we show how electromagnetic fields can be redirected at will and propose a design strategy. The conserved fields: electric displacement field, D, magnetic induction field, B, and Poynting vector, S, are all displaced in a consistent manner. A simple illustration is given of the cloaking of a proscribed volume of space to exclude completely all electromagnetic fields. Our work has relevance to exotic lens design and to the cloaking of objects from electromagnetic fields</description>

      <title>Disentangling temperature and Reynolds number effects in quantum turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid $^4$He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale's contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures $1.44 \, \mathrm{K} \lesssim T \lesssim 2.16 \, \mathrm{K}$ indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance $\ell$ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale $L_0$) should behave as $\ell/L_0 \approx 0.5 \, \mathrm{Re}_\kappa^{-3/4}$ with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation $\kappa$. This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this new approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.</description>

Abstract: Combining the tools for transforming space-time developed for General Relativity with the capabilities of artificially structured metamaterials, an entirely new means of controlling electromagnetic fields has emerged. Here, we utilize a coordinate transformation in which a hole is opened up in space. The transformation provides a complete prescription for an electromagnetic cloak which, although complex, can be readily constructed with metamaterials</description>

      <title>Magnetic field induced exciton spin dynamics in indirect band gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exciton recombination and spin dynamics are investigated both experimentally and theoretically in an ensemble of indirect band gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots (QDs) with type-I band alignment. The magnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the time-integrated photoluminescence changes sign across the emission spectrum with a width reflecting the QD size. It is negative on the low energy side, i.e. for emission from large QDs, but positive on the high energy side, i.e. for emission from small QDs. However, the exciton g factor, measured by spin-flip Raman scattering, is positive across the whole QD ensemble. The magnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the photoluminescence dynamics is studied as function of the magnetic field strength and direction. The dynamics are non-monotonic over a time range up to milliseconds. The time dependence of the photoluminescence circular polarization degree and sign strongly depends on the emission energy and changes with magnetic field orientation. The observed nonmonotonic behavior is provided by the interplay of bright and dark exciton states, contributing to the emission. The experiment is interpreted using a kinetic theory, which accounts for the dynamics of the spin states in the exciton level quartet in longitudinal and tilted magnetic fields, the radiative recombination processes, and the redistribution of the excitons between these states as result of spin relaxation. The model allows us to evaluate the electron and heavy hole spin relaxation times in QDs with different sizes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing thermoelectric efficiency of multilayer graphene by nanomeshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Multicolor groups for molecules and solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Just like we classify lions and tigers into the same panthera, but into different species, we can classify molecules and solids by their spatial and spin space symmetries. In magnetic molecules and solids, local moments of the atoms can be represented by different colors; we can therefore classify these materials by playing with colors. The advantage of the multicolor group scheme is that it unifies the classifications into a single framework through multicolor group theory, including the recently identified altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. In particular, non-magnetic compounds fall into 0-color groups, ferro/ferrimagnets fall into 1-color groups, antiferromagnets, as usual, fall into 2-color groups, and non-collinear magnets fall into the simple and complex multicolor groups. Moreover, confusions brought about by conventional magnetic-group classification can be resolved through this new framework.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid vortices in neutron star crusts are thought to be pinned to the lattice of nuclei in the crust. The unpinning of superfluid vortices in spin glitches therefore motivates us to study the vortex-crust interaction explicitly with molecular dynamics. In this work, we present a new molecular dynamics methods to characterize the response of the crust to a rigid vortex. When vortex pinning forces and nearest neighbor Coulomb forces are comparable, we observe a qualitatively new phenomena of lattice entrainment with implications for the elastic evolution of the crust.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically discuss a new kind of photonic spin-Hall effect (PSHE) for optical beams propagating inside an inhomogeneously twisted anisotropic material. The rotation angle plays the role of an effective gauge field. When the twisting distribution is odd symmetric, the optical beams move along mirror-symmetric trajectories according to their helicity. Connection of this volumetric PSHE with the geometric phase and the Kapitza effect is elucidated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe momentum transfer in the ponderomotive potential of near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) experiments with ultrashort extreme ultraviolet probe pulses. Acceleration of photoelectrons in the transient grating provided by an intense laser pulse reflected at a surface leads to delay-dependent oscillations of electric kinetic energies. Photon and electron momenta determine the oscillation frequency. We experimentally observe and theoretically simulate electron yield modulations driven by a novel electron-energy bunching effect. Measurement results are simulated and fitted with high accuracy. Complete reversion of the ponderomotive momentum transfer allows for retrieval of the undisturbed initial state and the transient band structure for overlapping pump and probe pulses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized Levy-Leblond equation (GLL) is used to study the bound state problem for a non-relativistic Fermi field in external potentials. A condition when the rest energy term can be removed from the GLL equation is determined. For external potentials which do not obey the condition, the bound state spectrum is affected non-trivially by the rest energy of the Fermi field. This is demonstrated for a spherical finite-depth well potential. The existence, number, and energies of bound states depend on the value of the rest energy.</description>

Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>
