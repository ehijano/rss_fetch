      <title>Characteristic features of the resonant trident process in the field of a strong monochromatic electromagnetic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic features of the resonant trident process (Oleinik resonances) have been theoretically studied in a wide range of frequencies and intensities of a circularly polarized strong electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is defined by two characteristic quantum energies: the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Compton effect and the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. These characteristic energies depend significantly on the frequency and intensity of the wave, as well as on the angle between the momenta of the initial electrons and the electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is effective when the energy of the initial electrons is greater than or on the order of magnitude of the corresponding characteristic energies. It is shown that quantum entanglement of final particles takes place in this resonant process. An important aspect of the resonant trident process is the equality of the energies of the electron and positron pairs. Analytical expressions for the differential rates of the resonant trident process on the energy of final particles are obtained. The corresponding analytical expressions for full rates have also been obtained. It is shown that the rate data of the resonant trident process in the field of optical and X-ray wave frequencies significantly exceed the corresponding rate of the non-resonant trident process. Results obtained can be used in experiments at leading laser centers, as well as to explain QED processes in strong X-ray fields near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the $\Box^2$ Higher-Derivative Operator Class for Universal Vacuum-Energy Cancellations and Higgs Naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of local, Lorentz-invariant, and Hermitian field theories, we investigate the classification of dimension-6 operators that facilitate the dynamical cancellation of vacuum-energy divergences. We demonstrate that the operator class based on the $\Box^2$ d'Alembertian is uniquely singled out by the requirement of universal power-divergence subtraction across all spin sectors. By explicitly evaluating the modified propagators and one-loop vacuum integrals, we show that only this structure consistently removes $\Lambda^4$ and $m^2\Lambda^2$ terms while preserving gauge covariance. Adopting the Real-Time Negative-Norm Prescription (RTNNP) as a consistent contour selection, we find that the higher-derivative Lee--Wick (HDLW) structure leads to a finite, calculable Higgs mass correction. Our results suggest a phenomenologically preferred scale of $M \approx 11.3$ TeV, offering a predictive and structurally motivated resolution to the hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Creation of spin-3/2 dark matter via cosmological gravitational particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) of spin-3/2 particles during and after cosmic inflation, and map the parameter space that can realize the observed dark matter density in stable spin-3/2 particles. Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism.</description>

      <title>The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon: status and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the status of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as a precision probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) after the release of the final results from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Muon $g-2$ experiment and the second White Paper of the Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative. While the SM prediction requires further improvements by a factor of four to fully leverage the sensitivity achieved in experiment, the FNAL measurement will set the standard for many years to come, and we discuss a variety of features of the experimental campaign that made this achievement possible. In going forward, we discuss current efforts to improve the SM prediction, and imagine how an experiment would have to be devised to surpass 124 ppb in precision.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Shape of Kerr Black Holes at the Photon Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bright ring-like structures observed in the images of M87* and SgrA* captured by the Event Horizon Telescope strongly support the validity of general relativity. Lensed images of the emission region, often referred to as photon rings in this context, are a direct consequence of the unstable dynamics of null geodesics near the spherical photon orbit in the Kerr spacetime. The order of the lensed image can be characterized by the number of half-orbits the photons complete before reaching the observer, with higher-order photon rings produced by null geodesics that circle the black hole more times. However, low-order rings are significantly influenced by the astrophysical environment. Measuring the Lyapunov exponent requires probing the exponentially small differences between successive photon rings or between photon rings and the shadow. We investigate potential astrophysical sources of systematic error the estimation of Lyapunov exponent, including the location of the observed emission, and especially at low photon ring order. We show that it is nevertheless possible to measure this purely gravitational quantity to roughly 10% and 1% systematic uncertainty by resolving the n=2 and n=3 photon rings with the shadow size, respectively. Therefore, the forthcoming black hole imaging efforts to capture, even if indirectly, the n=2 photon ring can result in a measurement of the Lyapunov exponent that is not limited by astrophysical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators of Spinning Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $N$-point energy correlator measures the energy flux through $N$ detectors. We present a general framework that characterizes its full angular dependence in a series of \textit{spinning energy correlators}. These spinning correlators resurrect the angular momentum structure of both the source and the detector configuration, lost otherwise in inclusive measurements. We demonstrate that unitarity and energy positivity confine these correlators to a sharply bounded region, with the boundary realized by extremal correlators generated by pure spin states. We present a first calculation of spinning energy correlators in QCD as well as spinning energy-charge correlators. Their enhanced insensitivity to infrared dynamics opens up a new set of observables that directly probe the hard part of the scattering. Finally, we provide generalized sum rules, extended to spinning correlators and to conserved charges beyond energy.</description>

      <title>Fermion Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma (with Applications to Neutron Stars)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic and complete study of thermal field theory with fermion fields of any kind for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also average angular momentum. This extends a previous study that focused on scalar fields, to all fermion-scalar theories. Both Dirac and Majorana fermions and both Dirac and Majorana masses are covered. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic interacting fermion-scalar theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. These general results are applied to physical situations typical of neutron stars, which are often quickly rotating: the Fermi surface and Fermi momentum, the average energy, number density and angular momentum for degenerate fermions and particle production (such as neutrino production from rotating neutron stars, e.g. pulsars). In particular, it is shown that the neutrino production rate due to the direct URCA (DU) processes grows indefinitely as the angular velocity approaches the inverse linear size of the plasma and, therefore, rotation can significantly increase this rate.</description>

      <title>Dark light shining on $B\to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Belle II data on $B^+ \to K^+ E_{\rm miss}$ show an excess consistent with a two-body decay involving a light invisible particle with mass around $2.1\,\mathrm{GeV}$. We present a UV-complete explanation based on a Higgsed $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry with a light vector boson $Z'$ and a vector-like top partner, which naturally enhances $b \to s$ transitions. While the minimal model can reproduce the required $B \to K^{(*)} Z'$ rate, it is excluded by LHCb searches for resonant dimuon decays due to unavoidable loop-induced couplings of $Z'$ to charged leptons. We show that a minimal extension with an additional light $U(1)'$-charged singlet fermion allows $Z'$ to decay dominantly invisibly, evades existing constraints coming also from dark photon and collider searches as well as Higgs measurements, and can simultaneously account for the Belle II excess and the observed dark matter abundance through resonant thermal freeze-out.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Properties of Large CP Violation in the Complex Two-Higgs-Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic properties of the parameter space capable of supporting large CP violation in the Complex Two-Higgs-Doublet Model with softly broken $Z_{2}$ symmetry, hosting three CP-mixed neutral Higgs mass eigenstates. Using a comprehensive global scan of Type-I and Type-II models -- incorporating all relevant theoretical requirements and collider constraints together with the stringent electron EDM (eEDM) bound -- we identify distinct phenomenological pathways to regions of large CP violation. In Type-I, we find that all viable parameter points predict a strict lower bound on the eEDM, $|d_e| &gt; 10^{-31}\,e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$, placing this scenario within definitive reach of next-generation EDM experiments; moreover, sizable CP violation in the gauge sector emerges only when the 125~GeV state is nearly degenerate with a second neutral Higgs boson. In contrast, Type-II suppresses gauge-sector CP violation but allows maximal CP mixing in the Yukawa sector of the heavy neutral scalars, exhibiting a strong correlation between large fermionic CP violation and the predicted eEDM. Finally, we uncover a phenomenon of ``hidden CP violation'' in the Higgs alignment limit: even as the heavy neutral scalars decouple from gauge bosons, their CP mixing remains entirely unconstrained and becomes increasingly maximal as the Yukawa-sector CP violation increases. We show that this hidden CP violation can be directly probed through the non-vanishing cubic interactions of the heavy neutral scalars to the charged Higgs and $W$ bosons.</description>

      <title>Early-Time Dynamics of Heavy-Ion Collisions through Energy Correlators: celestial blocks and the spacetime structure of out-of-equilibrium QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions provide a unique window into far-from-equilibrium states of QCD matter. The initial stages of these events are characterized by highly anisotropic, nonthermal dynamics that precede hydrodynamization, yet they remain largely inaccessible through conventional soft observables. In this work, we show that the substructure of mid-rapidity jets provides direct sensitivity to the spacetime structure of this early, anisotropic phase. Using classical Yang-Mills simulations and effective kinetic theory to model the early-time evolution of the jet quenching parameter, we compute the azimuthally differential energy-energy correlator within the BDMPS-Z framework. By decomposing the result into celestial blocks, we isolate the coefficients that encode the anisotropic geometry and dynamics of the underlying medium. We identify an observable that couples directly to spatial anisotropies in the out-of-equilibrium QCD matter and also discuss the impact of medium response on its behavior. We further extend our study to mid-rapidity jets generated with the JEWEL Monte-Carlo, adjusted to incorporate an anisotropic medium background, and find qualitative agreement with the analytical expectations. Finally, we discuss how higher-point energy correlators and generalized energy-flow operators can enhance the sensitivity to the microscopic structure of far-from-equilibrium QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Economical Jet Taggers -- Equivariant, Slim, and Quantized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning is transforming jet tagging at the LHC, but the leading transformer architectures are large, not particularly fast, and training-intensive. We present a slim version of the L-GATr tagger, reduce the number of parameters of jet-tagging transformers, and quantize them. We compare different quantization methods for standard and Lorentz-equivariant transformers and estimate their gains in resource efficiency. We find a six-fold reduction in energy cost for an moderate performance decrease, down to 1000-parameter taggers. This might be a step towards trigger-level jet tagging with small and quantized versions of the leading equivariant transformer architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additional sensitivities to Lorentz violation can be obtained from existing experiments by considering additional boost-suppressed effects. The additional Lorentz-violating signals arise as variations in experimental observables at the commonly-used sidereal frequency as well as more novel frequencies. In this work we provide some examples that serve to illustrate how interesting signals arise from the structure of the relevant boost transformations.</description>

      <title>Another Fit Bites the Dust: Conformal Prediction as a Calibration Standard for Machine Learning in High-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning techniques are essential in modern collider research, yet their probabilistic outputs often lack calibrated uncertainty estimates and finite-sample guarantees, limiting their direct use in statistical inference and decision-making. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a simple, distribution-free framework for calibrating arbitrary predictive models without retraining, yielding rigorous uncertainty quantification with finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal exchangeability assumptions, without reliance on asymptotics, limit theorems, or Gaussian approximations. In this work, we investigate CP as a unifying calibration layer for machine-learning applications in high-energy physics. Using publicly available collider datasets and a diverse set of models, we show that a single conformal formalism can be applied across regression, binary and multi-class classification, anomaly detection, and generative modelling, converting raw model outputs into statistically valid prediction sets, typicality regions, and p-values with controlled false-positive rates. While conformal prediction does not improve raw model performance, it enforces honest uncertainty quantification and transparent error control. We argue that conformal calibration should be adopted as a standard component of machine-learning pipelines in collider physics, enabling reliable interpretation, robust comparisons, and principled statistical decisions in experimental and phenomenological analyses.</description>

      <title>A Brief History and Outlook of Hadronic Physics in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic physics has gradually emerged as one of the growing research frontiers in Indonesia, driven by efforts to better understand the properties of the strong interaction and the internal structure of hadrons from the fundamental principles of Quantum Chromodynamics. In the last few decades, Indonesian researchers have made significant contributions to developing various theoretical and phenomenological aspects of hadrons. In addition, on the experimental side, Indonesian scientists have participated in hadron experiment facilities overseas, such as the ALICE collaboration at CERN, which has strengthened the scientific activities and networks and has supported the training of young Indonesian researchers. In the present paper, we review Indonesian scientists' contributions to hadronic physics, highlight ongoing research directions in both experimental and theoretical, and outline strategies for future development toward integration into the international hadronic physics community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dark photon dark matter $X$ associated with a dark $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. To evade laboratory and cosmological constraints on kinetic mixing with the Standard Model $U(1)_Y$, we assign a $Z_2$-odd dark parity to $X$ that forbids such mixing. The leading interactions then arise from gauge-invariant dimension-6 Higgs-portal operators, including both parity-even and parity-odd terms. We assume that the dark matter mass is generated via the Stueckelberg mechanism, which also induces a dimension-4 Higgs-portal operator $(H^\dagger H) X_\mu X^\mu$ and additional dimension-6 operators. We investigate freeze-in production of $X$ from Higgs-pair annihilations after reheating, incorporating both gauge-invariant and Stueckelberg-induced operators. First, we consider the case in which the Wilson coefficients of the gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators, $C$ and $\tilde{C}$, are of order unity. We find that, in this case, the Stueckelberg contributions remain subdominant in dark matter production. This result follows from the requirement that the effective scale implied by perturbative unitarity must exceed the cutoff scale of the effective field theory. Next, we explore a more general situation in which $C$ and $\tilde{C}$ are smaller than unity. In this second case, Stueckelberg-induced operators can become comparable and lead to distinctive features in the dark-matter parameter space, including interference effects. For both cases, we show that there exists a wide parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density.</description>

      <title>Running of neutrino mass parameters in the Zee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the size of quantum corrections in the Zee model using effective field theory techniques. We derive the relevant 1-loop matching conditions and use them together with the existing renormalisation group equations in the two Higgs doublet model to calculate quantum corrections to the neutrino mass squared differences, mixing angles, and phases. Using four benchmark scenarios, we demonstrate when quantum corrections have to be included in studies of neutrino mass parameters in the Zee model.</description>

      <title>Detecting Axion Dark Matter with an Organic Molecular Maser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17271v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum sensing approach to search for axion-electron interactions around the axion mass of 6 \mueV. In this region, laboratory searches are relatively scarce, and our direct experiment measuring the axion-electron coupling constant reaches the sensitivity of 8 \times 10^{-6} GeV^{-1}. The method, based on an organic molecular maser establishes a proof-of-principle for quantum-enhanced detection, with a corresponding magnetic field sensitivity of 0.85 fT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}. The methodology is generic and can be readily extended to other physical systems, further broadening its applicability in quantum sensing and dark matter searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate all three-loop, five-point, massless planar Feynman integral families in the dimensional regularization scheme. This is a new milestone in Feynman integral computations. The analysis covers four distinct families of Feynman integrals for this configuration, for all of which we derive the canonical differential equations. Our results also confirm a prediction on the three-loop five-point alphabet. The boundary values are analytically determined. Using these differential equations, the integrals can be evaluated to high precision efficiently. Our work establishes the foundation for next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order (N$^3$LO) calculation of the production of three massless final states, as well as corresponding bootstrap studies in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>GUT-based NMSSM with Singlino Dark Matter: Describing the ATLAS/CMS Excesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main goals of the ongoing LHC program is the search for BSM physics, with EW SUSY partners still allowed with masses as low as a few hundred GeV. Over the last years, searches for the ``golden channel'', $pp \to \tilde\chi^0_2 \tilde\chi^\pm_1 \to \tilde\chi^0_1 Z^{(*)} \, \tilde\chi^0_1 W^{\pm (*)}$ show consistent excesses between CMS and ATLAS in the 2 soft-lepton and 3 soft-lepton plus missing $E_T$ searches, favoring mass scales of $m_{\tilde\chi^0_2} \approx m_{\tilde\chi^{\pm}_1} \ge 200$ GeV and $\Delta m_{21} := m_{\tilde\chi^0_2} - m_{\tilde\chi^0_1} \approx 20$ GeV. We analyze these excesses in the framework of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). We assume a singlino dominated lighest neutralino, $\tilde\chi^0_1$, as our Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The second and third lightest neutralinos, $\tilde\chi^0_{2,3}$ are higgsino like, with the higgsino mixing parameter $\mu$ being smaller than the soft SUSY-breaking bino and wino masses, $M_1$ and $M_2$. In particular, we assume the approximate GUT relations $M_1 \sim M_2/2 \sim M_3/6$, yielding a gluino mass $m_{\tilde g} \sim M_3 \ge 2$ TeV, in agreement with the LHC search limits. The scalar masses are assumed to heavy and do not play a role in our analysis. We demonstrate that this scenario is in agreement with all relevant experimental constraints, comprising the DM direct detection limits and the upper limit on the DM relic density, the LHC searches for SUSY particles and additional Higgs bosons, as well as the LHC Higgs-boson rate measurements. This constitutes the first explanation of the soft-lepton excesses in a model with GUT relations among the soft SUSY-breaking parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the primary Lund plane density for jets initiated by a massive ($b$) quark to single logarithmic accuracy in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In order to capture mass effects, we consider quasi-collinear factorisation and we include contributions from the running of the QCD coupling and from collinear evolution, in a variable flavour-number scheme. Furthermore, the resummation of soft logarithms, including clustering effects, is performed numerically, keeping the full dependence on the $b$-quark mass. While our all-order results can be applied to both hadron and lepton colliders, we present, as first phenomenological application, the resummed calculation of the Lund plane density in $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=M_Z$, matched to tree-level matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Evidence for dynamical chiral condensate in high-energy heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics with light quarks features an approximate global symmetry, known as chiral symmetry, that is believed to be spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of a scalar and isoscalar composite field, in addition to a small explicit breaking due to finite quark masses. For a high enough temperature, as achieved in the early universe or the fireball created by a high-energy heavy ion collision, this symmetry is expected to be restored. We show theoretically that a coherent deviation of the corresponding quantum field from its usual vacuum expectation value on the freeze-out hypersurface of a heavy-ion collision leads, after resonance decays, to a characteristic contribution to the transverse momentum spectrum of charged pions, in the very soft regime, consistent with experimental data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. Taken together, the experimental data with the new theoretical results provide compelling support for the existence of a chiral condensation mechanism with partial restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperature.</description>

      <title>Expected flavor composition of supernova neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the flavor composition of neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae (SN), focusing on robust predictions that are insensitive to the poorly known dynamics of collective flavor conversion in the inner core. Assuming that the many different trajectories and microscopic histories of neutrinos lead to decoherence of the ensemble at the boundary between the region of collective effects and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) dominated layers, we show that standard matter effects alone strongly constrain the electron-flavor fraction at Earth. For normal mass ordering (NO) we obtain $f_{\nu_e}^{\rm NO}\lesssim 0.5$ at all times and energies, while for inverted ordering (IO), we predict $f_{\nu_e}^{\rm IO}\simeq 1/3$, i.e.\ near flavor equipartition. Shock-wave propagation through the high (H) MSW resonance drives the system toward equipartition also in NO. In this way our framework links simple assumptions about decoherence and standard matter effects to robust expectations for the flavor evolution inside core-collapse supernovae. This contribution summarizes the main results of arXiv:2403.14762.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive holographic Study of Proton Structure: From Spectroscopy and Form Factors to the $\gamma p\rightarrow J/\psi p$ Scattering Cross Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of the proton-including its mass spectrum, electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, and mechanical properties-remains a central challenge in hadronic physics. While lattice QCD and experimental measurements provide valuable insights, a unified holographic framework capable of simultaneously describing these diverse observables and connecting them to measurable scattering processes is still lacking. Here, we employ the soft wall model, a holographic approach that incorporates gluon condensation and linear confinement, to systematically compute the proton mass spectrum, electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs), and gravitational form factors (GFFs). Our results show good agreement with recent experimental data and lattice QCD calculations. We further derive the corresponding proton radii and mechanical properties, such as pressure and shear force distributions. Finally, using the obtained GFFs as input, we calculate the cross-section for the photoproduction process $\gamma p\rightarrow J/\psi p$. Our calculations demonstrate that the soft wall model consistently reproduces key proton structure observables and predicts a scattering cross-section in agreement with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>How much color do we really need? Two-loop subleading-color effects in photon and jet physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the complete set of cross sections for Large Hadron Collider (LHC) processes ending with three resolved final states consisting of either photons or jets has been evaluated at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD and leading order in QED. Results for three photons or three jets have only been obtained using the leading-color approximation of the virtual two-loop amplitudes. In the meantime, the required amplitudes have become available without recourse to the color expansion. In the present publication, we quantify the effects of the subleading-color contributions, and show that they do not exceed 2\% for most of the previously published results. The one exception is the ratio of three- to two-jet cross sections, where subleading-color effects can reach up to 5\%. Furthermore, we show that these conclusions hold for both popular infrared renormalization schemes, minimal subtraction and Catani's. The size of the effects is usually overshadowed by the size of the remaining uncertainty due to the truncation of the perturbation series. This is particularly important in the case of three-jet distributions that have already been used for the extraction of the strong-coupling constant at the very high energies available at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Only slightly "Amplifying nonresonant production of dark sector particles in scattering dominance regime''</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent article [PhysRevD.109.055041 (2024)] it has been argued that production of dark photons -- hypothetical massive vectors -- in nuclear reactors via mixing with the visible photons is considerably enhanced (by a factor of 10) due to Compton scattering of the latter. We revisit the production of dark photons in the reactor environment and find that although the scattering of photons indeed leads to a larger number of produced dark photons, the overall enhancement is considerably smaller than what has been obtained in Ref. [PhysRevD.109.055041 (2024)]. Our findings are validated using GEANT simulations, which take into account oscillations between ordinary and visible photons and interaction of the latter with matter. The correction to the limit on mixing parameter between dark and visible photons is expected to be below 30% for all masses. It's application must be accompanied with an update on the original spectrum of photons produced in nuclear reactions inside the nuclear reactor.</description>

      <title>Two-lepton tales: Dalitz decays of heavy quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dalitz decays of heavy quarkonia, which result from the internal virtual photon conversion into an $\ell^+ \ell^-$ lepton pair. Heavy-quark symmetries allow us to establish systematic relations between transitions of different quarkonium states, and to precisely determine the branching fractions for several charmonium and bottomonium decay modes. For charmonium, existing data on $\chi_{cJ}(1P)\to J/\psi \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $\psi(2S)\to \chi_{cJ}(1P) \ell^+ \ell^-$ enable us to determine the parameters of the transition form factors and to predict the rates of yet-unobserved modes. The Dalitz transitions of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ are important, as they can help assessing the structure of this meson. For bottomonium, recent LHCb measurements allow us to predict the branching fractions of $\chi_{bJ}(nP)\to \Upsilon(1S)\ell^+ \ell^-$ and $h_b(nP)\to \eta_b(1S) \ell^+ \ell^-$ ($n=1,\,2)$. We also investigate the sensitivity of heavy quarkonia Dalitz modes to the contribution of a new light vector mediator, such as the putative $X(17)$.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis and Dark Matter in an Inverse Seesaw from gauged B-L breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamical realization of the low-scale Inverse Seesaw mechanism in which the approximate $B-L$ symmetry is gauged and spontaneously broken. Anomaly cancellation requires additional chiral fermions, one of which becomes a stable dark matter candidate after symmetry breaking, while another remains massless and contributes to dark radiation. Focusing on the regime of feeble gauge interactions, we compute the dark matter relic abundance produced via the freeze-in mechanism through the $B-L$ gauge boson and identify the parameter space consistent with cosmological and laboratory constraints. We show that the same region naturally avoids thermalization of heavy neutral leptons, preserving the viability of ARS leptogenesis. The interplay between dark matter production, dark radiation constraints, and leptogenesis requirements leads to a predictive scenario where future cosmological surveys and intensity-frontier experiments such as SHiP can probe significant portions of the viable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis and EDMs in the 2HDM+CS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first joint analysis of baryogenesis from initial Higgs charges (also called Higgsogenesis) and EDMs in a model with two Higgs doublets, a complex scalar and a Majorana fermion. In our proposed scenario, baryogenesis happens in three steps: (1) The decay of the scalar produces an asymmetry between the two Higgs doublets which is partly transferred to fermions via Standard Model processes. (2) This asymmetry is converted into a $B-L$ charge via interactions mediated by the Majorana fermion. (3) The weak sphaleron processes partially convert the resulting $B-L$ charge into a $B$ asymmetry. We perform a numerical analysis of baryogenesis and the EDM contributions and find that, due to resonant enhancement, baryogenesis is possible with singlet masses as low as $10^5$ GeV. We also find that for some parameters, the model can give large contributions to the electron and neutron EDM while also producing baryogenesis. The present scenario offers a new perspective on interpreting observational bounds in terms of cosmology: Because it relies on out-of-equilibrium decays, the questions of baryogenesis and $CP$ violation in the Higgs sector may be linked with EDM signals without the additional assumption of a first order electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Boiling away asymmetries: low-scale phase transitions, gravitational waves and leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptogenesis is one of the most popular mechanisms to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. A generic feature of leptogenesis is a large separation of scales between the epoch of baryon asymmetry production (sphaleron freeze-out at temperature $T \sim 130$ GeV) and the one where it affects the big bang nucleosynthesis processes (BBN at $T \sim 1$ MeV). Any entropy release between these two epochs would lead to a dilution of previously produced relics, such as the baryons. Motivated by the recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range, we consider the case of supercooled first-order phase transition and we study the impact of the induced entropy dilution on the leptogenesis parameter space. We employ the Type-I seesaw with 2 right-handed neutrinos as benchmark scenario, and demonstrate that the viable leptogenesis parameter space is significantly reduced. Interestingly, the values of dilution predicted by the SGWB best fit points in several first order phase transition scenarios would completely exclude the leptogenesis parameter space testable by future experiments, thus establishing a phenomenological interconnection between leptogenesis, SGWB, first order phase transition and neutrino mass generation. Our analysis can be generalised to different leptogenesis models and entropy dilution mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Unified study of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ and $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a unified description of the experimental data of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$, the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$, and the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)\pi^+ \pi^-)$. The strong final state interactions between the two pseudoscalars are taken into account using a parametrization fulfilling unitarity and analyticity. We find that there is universality in the coupling constants for $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ and $B_s^0 \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ processes. While the couplings of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^-$ are about half of magnitude smaller than the couplings of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$, which indicates that the $X(3872)$ is different from a pure charmonium state. Furthermore, we find that the $f_0(1500)$ plays an important role in the $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ and the $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ processes, though the phase space of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) f_0(1500)$ is small. Also we predict the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)\pi^+ \pi^-]$ and the $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass distribution of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}$.</description>

      <title>From Lead to Helium: Discovery Potential for Jet Quenching in the Smallest Collision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) predictions for the modification to the yield of high-momentum particles in very light ion collisions - ${}^{10}\mathrm{B} + {}^{10}\mathrm{B}$, ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li} + {}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He} + {}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{3}\mathrm{He} + {}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ - both with and without medium-induced energy loss. We show that there is non-trivial suppression expected from our partonic energy loss model in symmetric systems from ${}^{208}\mathrm{Pb} + {}^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ to ${}^{3}\mathrm{He} + {}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and in asymmetric systems $A + B$, and that the energy loss scales approximately with $(\sqrt{A B})^{1 / 3}$. Further, we find that deep inelastic scattering measurements in ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ tightly constrain the nPDF baseline, making these isotopes a particularly clean environment for observing final-state partonic energy loss induced by the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in these very small systems.</description>

      <title>Dijet production in DIS off a large nucleus at next-to-eikonal accuracy in a Gaussian model within the CGC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Gaussian model to evaluate the decorated dipole and quadrupole operators that arise beyond the eikonal approximation in the Color Glass Condensate framework. While the method is general and applicable to arbitrary beyond-eikonal Wilson line structures, we employ it for dijet production in deep inelastic scattering at next-to-eikonal accuracy. After validating the model at the eikonal level, we compute all next-to-eikonal operator structures entering the dijet cross section. We show that some of them do not contribute to this observable, while others vanish identically. Therefore, in the Gaussian model next-to-eikonal corrections to dijet production in deep inelastic scattering originate solely from a given type of operators and from next-to-eikonal three-point correlators. The resulting expressions are provided in a form suitable for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Probing electroweak pair production of heavy neutral leptons with displaced vertices at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of displaced vertex searches at the LHC to heavy neutral leptons (also known as sterile neutrinos) that are produced in pairs with an electroweak-size cross section. We work within the context of a supersymmetric model in which the sterile neutrino is produced along with Standard Model particles in higgsino decays. By making use of model-independent reconstruction efficiencies provided by the ATLAS collaboration in their search for displaced vertices with multiple jets, we obtain constraints on this model from $139$ fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by ATLAS during the LHC Run~2, and assess the discovery reach of Run~3 and of the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Depending on the higgsino mass parameter, sterile neutrino masses between $20~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $230~\mathrm{GeV}$ and active-sterile neutrino mixings in the range $4 \times 10^{-14} \lesssim V^2_N \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-10}$ can be excluded. At the HL-LHC, discovery-level significances could be reached for sterile neutrinos masses up to $295~\mathrm{GeV}$ and values of $V^2_N$ down to $3 \times 10^{-14}$. Finally, moving away from the supersymmetric scenario, we study to which extent these results can be generalized to a broader class of models in which the sterile neutrinos are produced in the decays of heavier particles that are themselves pair-produced with an electroweak-size cross section.</description>

      <title>Probing new physics in the Boosted $HH \to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ channel at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first dedicated study of the boosted $HH \to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ topology as a key probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) in the high-energy double-Higgs boson regime. The analysis presented in this paper, focuses on two classes of new-physics scenarios: non-resonant deviations of the quartic gauge--Higgs interaction, parameterized by the coupling modifier $\kappa_{2V}$, and resonant enhancement arising from the decay of a heavy scalar state, modeled within a two-Higgs-doublet framework. We demonstrate that the boosted reconstruction category enhances sensitivity to beyond SM effects that populate the high-$m_{HH}$ tail, yielding improved constraints on $\kappa_{2V}$ and extending the discovery reach for heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>The role of charm and unflavored mesons in prompt atmospheric lepton fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The all-sky very-high-energy ($10^4-10^6$ GeV) atmospheric muon flux measured by IceCube shows a spectral hardening at the highest energies, indicating the presence of a prompt component. IceCube has also measured the atmospheric muon neutrino flux at high energy. However, since this flux is dominated by astrophysical neutrinos, only an upper bound can be placed on the prompt atmospheric $\nu_\mu+\bar{\nu}_\mu$ contribution. In this work, we provide a new evaluation of the prompt atmospheric muon flux including an intrinsic charm component in the cosmic ray-air interactions. The latter enhances the forward production of $\bar{D}^0$, $D^-$, and $\Lambda_c$, which subsequently decay into final states containing muons and muon neutrinos. We show how the increase in the prompt muon flux due to intrinsic charm is accompanied by a corresponding enhancement in the prompt muon neutrino flux. We implement different intrinsic charm production models in MCEq to calculate the resulting lepton fluxes. We discuss the challenges of achieving predictions that are simultaneously consistent with both IceCube's high-energy atmospheric muon flux measurements and IceCube upper bound on the prompt muon neutrino flux, and we quantify the resulting discrepancies. As possible solutions, we explore scaling of the unflavored meson contributions to the prompt atmospheric muon flux to assess how such adjustments can reconcile these differences. The tensions emphasized in our work call for a refinement of the hadronic interaction models, especially the production of unflavored mesons, and for new experimental data sensitive to unflavored meson and heavy flavor production with reliable estimates of the associated uncertainties. We suggest that the energy and zenith angle dependence of muon and neutrino flux ratios from future neutrino telescope measurements may help to disentangle different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Feasibility to probe the dynamical scotogenic model at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a feasibility study to probe dark matter (DM) production at the LHC within a global $U(1)_L$ scotogenic model. The study is conducted using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method, considering the viable parameter space of the model allowed by experimental constraints such as neutrino oscillation data, the Higgs to invisible branching fraction, and DM observables. The production of scalar and fermionic DM candidates, predicted by the model, is then studied under the LHC conditions for different luminosity scenarios imposing compressed mass spectra conditions between the lightest fermion and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ odd scalars. We studied two production mechanisms, Drell-Yan and Vector Boson Fusion. It was found that the Drell-Yan mechanism gives better detection prospects for fermionic DM masses between 100-220~\textrm{GeV} at high luminosity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on 3-forms dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3-forms are natural candidates for describing the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, as they can inherently reproduce a positive cosmological constant when lacking an evolving potential. When such a potential is present, a 3-form field may exhibit either quintessence-like or phantom-like behaviour. In this paper, we consider a 3-form model with a Gaussian potential, which features stable, ghost-free phantom-like behaviour within its convergence region and leads to an LSBR late-time attractor. We constrain this model observationally by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis employing a comprehensive cosmological dataset, including Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data, low-$z$ Cepheid calibrators, and DES Y1 large-scale structure observations. We demonstrate that the 3-form model successfully increases the predicted Hubble parameter of CMB and BAO data from $67.89\pm0.36{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ of $\Lambda$CDM model to $68.29^{+0.56}_{-0.61}{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ without fine-tuning of the model parameters, thus reducing the tension with the late-time observation. Furthermore, we verify the sub-dominance of the 3-form field perturbation via both analytical and numerical analyses. Thus, the 3-form field does serve as a promising candidate of phantom-like dark energy from both theoretical and observational points of view.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Action Integral for Photon-Photon Interactions in Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating through vacuum can polarize virtual electron-positron pairs; this polarization, in turn, nonlinearly modifies their propagation. A semi-classical nonlinear wave equation describing the propagation is derived from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian density, which captures vacuum polarization effects up to the one-loop level. Here, we present a reduced-action-integral approach that enables rapid modeling of nonlinear phenomena arising from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian. Application of the variational principle to the reduced action provides equations of motion for familiar light-pulse parameters, such as spot size, phase, polarization, and phase-front curvature, without requiring full-field simulations. Three examples demonstrate the utility of the approach: phase modulation, birefringence, and frequency mixing.</description>

      <title>Dynamical equation for quark spin polarization in the rotating medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP) behaves approximately as a rotating fluid due to the system's initial angular momentum. In this rotating fluid, the spins of quarks become polarized due to the coupling between spin and angular momentum, as well as random spin-spin interactions. Since the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation effectively describes the spin polarization of fermions in a medium with a magnetic field, we derive a phenomenological equation analogous to the LL equation for heavy quark spin dynamics in the rotating medium. The spin-angular momentum coupling and random spin-spin interactions are incorporated, leading to a detailed balance of heavy quark spin distributions. This equation provides insight into the spin dynamics of heavy quarks and quarkonium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>On Signatures of a Possible New Physics Resonance in Atmospheric Air Showers Using a Parameterized Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a parameterized model of atmospheric particle showers initiated by cosmic rays. Few physics shower parameters are tuned in a comparison to the Conex generator. Resulting shower properties are studied, with a comment on the cases where multiple shower maxima develop.
  Finally, we implement simple models of new physics resonance of masses of 100 GeV and 1 TeV and examine their effects on the shower profile, depth and maximum variation in dependence of the decay channel of the hypothetical resonance. It is shown that a new resonance effects can appear at the energy threshold and can persist for about a decade in $\log_{10} E/\mathrm{eV}$.
  Various assumed decay modes of the hypothetical resonance have different effects on the direction and shape of the modified average shower depth as function of the energy, with possible implications for current or future measurements. It is shown that, within the presented model, the visibility of the resonance in modified shower depth strongly depends on the resonance width. A significant modification at 10\% width gradually diminishes towards the percent-level width. We propose that looking at the 2D distributions of the two first individual shower moments can also reveal signatures of new physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum state of interacting primordial inhomogeneities: de-squeezing and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how interactions affect the quantum state of scalar perturbations during inflation and the quantum correlations they may exhibit. Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Simulating vacuum birefringence with a diffractive beam propagation code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ninety years after their prediction, quantum vacuum nonlinearities in macroscopic electromagnetic fields still await a direct experimental verification in the laboratory. A particularly promising route towards their first measurement is the collision of counter-propagating laser beams in a pump-probe type experiment. Here, the key challenge is to separate the small quantum vacuum signal at the oscillation frequency of the probe that is mainly emitted in the vicinity of its forward cone from the large probe background. While quantitatively accurate predictions of the associated quantum vacuum signals are available, to date there is no framework that combines these predictions with a diffractive beam propagation code. Such codes are designed to holistically model optical experiments and can reliably account for diffraction and absorption losses of optical devices, like lenses and apertures. The latter inevitably influence and modify both the induced signal and background components prior to their detection in experiment. The present work addresses this topical issue and reports on the first implementation of a quantum vacuum signals emission module in an established diffractive beam propagation toolkit designed for the realistic modelling of optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards a fluid-dynamic description of an entire heavy-ion collision: from the colliding nuclei to the quark-gluon plasma phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid-dynamical modeling of a nuclear collision at high energy usually starts shortly after the collision. A major source of uncertainty comes from the detailed modeling of the initial state. While the collision itself likely involves far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is not excluded that a fluid theory of second order can reasonably well describe its soft features. Here we explore this possibility and discuss how the state before the collision can be described in that setup, examine the required fluid-dynamical equations of motion and study the resulting entropy production. While we do here only first steps, we outline a larger program, which could lead to a dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions where the only uncertainty lies in the thermodynamic and transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Active learning emulators for nuclear two-body scattering in momentum space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the active learning emulators for two-body scattering in coordinate space with error estimation, recently developed by Maldonado et al. in Phys. Rev. C \textbf{112}, 024002, to coupled-channel scattering in momentum space. Our full-order model (FOM) solver is based on the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation for the scattering $t$-matrix as opposed to the radial Schr\"odinger equation. We use (Petrov-)Galerkin projections and high-fidelity calculations at a few snapshots across the parameter space of the interaction to construct efficient reduced-order models (ROMs), trained by a greedy algorithm for locally optimal snapshot selection. Both the FOM solver and the corresponding ROMs are implemented efficiently in Python using Google's JAX library. We present results for emulating scattering phase shifts in coupled and uncoupled channels and cross sections, and assess the accuracy of the developed ROMs and their computational speed-up factors. We also develop emulator error estimation for both the $t$-matrix and the total cross section. The software framework for reproducing and extending our results will be made publicly available. Together with our recent advances in developing active-learning emulators for three-body scattering, these emulator frameworks set the stage for full Bayesian calibrations of chiral nuclear interactions and optical models against scattering data with quantified emulator errors.</description>

      <title>Trails of clouds in binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes can give rise to long-lived bosonic clouds, offering natural laboratories to probe ultralight particles across a wide range of parameter space. The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.</description>

      <title>Review of Neutral Naturalness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hierarchy between the mass parameter of the Higgs boson and larger mass scales becomes ever more puzzling as experiments explore higher energies. Neutral naturalness is the umbrella term for symmetry-based explanations for these hierarchies whose quark symmetry partners are not charged under the SU(3) color gauge group of the Standard Model. Though the first manifestations of this idea predate the physics runs of the Large Hadron Collider, since the Higgs discovery this paradigm has grown and developed to include a wide variety of concrete realizations with connections to intriguing collider signals. Determining the phenomenology of such models often requires the characterization - typically relying on lattice calculations - of a new confining gauge symmetry. This presents additional motivation to further develop our understanding of nonperturbative field theory as well as to pursue specific lattice studies. The wide range of suggested hidden sectors also produces a variety of dark matter candidates, intersections with astrophysics and cosmology, and ties to neutrinos and flavor. In this review, we orient the reader within both this growing collection of specific models and the physical phenomena they produce. We also survey the often less familiar dynamics of hidden-sector glueballs and quirks. In addition to providing a guide to past efforts, we reveal interesting directions for further study.</description>

      <title>Rescuing leptogenesis in inverse seesaw models with the help of non-Abelian flavor symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse seesaw (ISS) model provides an attractive framework that can naturally explain the smallness of neutrino masses while accommodating some sterile neutrinos potentially accessible at present or future experiments. However, in generic ISS models with hierarchical pseudo-Dirac (PD) sterile neutrino pairs, the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via the leptogenesis mechanism is extremely challenging. In this paper, we investigate rescuing leptogenesis in the ISS model with the help of non-Abelian flavor symmetries which have the potential to explain the observed peculiar neutrino mixing pattern: we first implement non-Abelian flavor symmetries to naturally enforce mass degeneracies among different pseudo-Dirac sterile neutrino pairs and then break them in a proper way so that resonant leptogenesis among different PD sterile neutrino pairs can arise, thus enhancing the generated baryon asymmetry. To be specific, we have considered the following two well-motivated approaches for generating the tiny mass splittings among different PD sterile neutrino pairs: one approach makes use of the renormalization-group corrections to the sterile neutrino masses, while the other approach invokes non-trivial flavor structure of the $\mu_{\rm s}$ matrix. For these two scenarios, we aim to explore the viability of leptogenesis and to identify the conditions under which the observed baryon asymmetry can be successfully reproduced.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of axial anomaly effects in hot two-color QCD: FRG approach in the linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal properties of hadrons in two-color quantum chromodynamics (QC$_2$D) using the functional renormalization group (FRG) method, with particular focus on modifications of the $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. The hadrons are described by a linear sigma model (LSM) based on the Pauli-G\"{u}rsey $SU(4)$ symmetry, which incorporates both low-lying $0^\pm$ mesons and diquark baryons. We find that all quartic couplings are comparably suppressed when physical values of the pion mass and decay constant are taken as inputs, for which a reasonably smooth chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature is reproduced. Consequently, mass differences among chiral partners remain small. Despite these tiny mass differences, mass degeneracies of chiral partners in the hot medium are clearly demonstrated, consistent with chiral symmetry restoration. Moreover, we find that the couplings responsible for the $U(1)$ axial anomaly are enhanced upon entering the finite temperature regime. Baryonic fluctuations also provide sizable contributions to these enhancements. Finally, the fate of the topological susceptibility in the hot QC$_2$D medium is examined.</description>

      <title>Melting down a tetraquark: $D^{\ast}D^{(\ast)}$ interactions and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ in a hot environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the modification of the properties of the tetraquark-like $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and its heavy quark spin partner, $T_{cc}(4016)^{*+}$ immersed in a hot bath of pions. We consider these exotic states as purely isoscalar $DD^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ $S$-wave bound states, respectively. Finite temperature effects are incorporated through the $D$ and $D^\ast$ state-of-the-art thermal spectral functions calculated in [G. Montana et al., Phys. Rev. D, 102 (2020) 096020], using the imaginary-time formalism. We find important modifications of the $DD^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ scattering amplitudes already for $T=80$ MeV, and show that the hot-bath lineshapes of these tetraquark-like states strongly depend on their Weinberg molecular content. We find that the thermal $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and $T_{cc}(4016)^{*+}$ spectral functions change more rapidly with temperature for high molecular probabilities $P_0$. For large values of $P_0$, the widths significantly increase with temperature, leading to the melting of these exotic states for temperatures larger than 80 MeV. For small molecular components, the changes in the spectral functions of these states due to temperature become significantly less important. All these results show that any future experimental determination of the $D^{(\ast)}D^*$ scattering amplitudes at finite temperature will provide valuable insights into the molecular content of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and $T_{cc}(4016)^{*+}$ exotics.</description>

      <title>Return of the Lepton Number: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production and the Revival of the Shi-Fuller Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism, revisiting its cosmological viability in light of recent results demonstrating that lepton-number asymmetries $L_\alpha \gtrsim 1$ at temperatures $T &gt; 20\rm\,MeV$ are consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using a quasiclassical Boltzmann transport calculation of the dark matter production, we compute the nonthermal phase space distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$ and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing structure formation limits and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest preferences in the context of SF production. We find that lepton asymmetries $L \gtrsim 0.5$ at high temperatures open significant viable parameter space in the $m_s \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sin^2 (2\theta) \lesssim 10^{-14}$ regime, compatible with both x-ray constraints from NuSTAR and INTEGRAL/SPI and recent Lyman-$\alpha$ inferences of $m_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.1\,\mathrm{keV}$. Following lepton number evolution below 20 MeV, we also specifically show that this lepton asymmetry parameter space is compatible with BBN and cosmic microwave background constraints. We present updated constraints, a refined $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ fitting function, and power-law approximations for $L$ across the parameter space. Our results motivate future x-ray observations targeting the $\sim\! 20\,\mathrm{keV}$ photon regime and testing of the $m_\mathrm{th} \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ WDM region.</description>

      <title>Topological Stabilization via Higgs and $Z$-Boson Mediated Repulsions in Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify two distinct repulsive mechanisms in the Cho-Maison monopole-antimonopole pair (MAP) configuration. Our results show that the Higgs-mediated repulsion exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on both topological charge and Higgs self-coupling, confirming its topological origin while revealing a mass-controlled range transition that deviates from the exponential form of a Yukawa potential. Simultaneously, the $Z$-boson field generates localized repulsive cores of radius $R_c\approx0.8\,m_W^{-1}$, consistent with the weak interaction scale. The collaborative effect of these mechanisms -- operating in different physics regimes -- counteracts the magnetic attraction, establishing a stabilization paradigm for the Cho-Maison MAP that extends naturally to other topological solitons in the Standard Model and various systems described by effective field theories.</description>

Abstract: We propose an extension of the initial condition model TRENTo for sampling the number of partons inside the nucleons that participate in a heavy-ion collision. This sampling method is based on parton distribution functions (PDFs) and therefore has a natural dependence on the momentum transferred in the collision and the scale being probed during the collision. We examine the resulting distributions and their dependence on the momentum transfer. Additionally, we explore the sensitivity of different observables on the number of partons using the TRENTo framework and the estimators available therein for final-state observables.</description>

These results provide high-precision fixed-order and resummed inputs to TMD phenomenology, and constitute essential theoretical ingredients for future studies of the spin structure and three-dimensional tomography of hadrons at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Cosmic Structure Strikes Back: The Elimination of Vector-Mediated Nonstandard Interaction Models as a Mechanism for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit sterile-neutrino production enabled by nonstandard interactions (NSI) among active neutrinos mediated by new bosons. We focus on vector mediators, including neutrinophilic, gauged $L_\mu\!-\!L_\tau$, and $B\!-\!L$ realizations that modify in-medium dispersion and scattering, thereby altering the active-sterile conversion history. Building on a novel production framework with NSI thermal potentials and collision integrals, we compute nonthermal phase-space distributions across sterile neutrino mixing and NSI parameters and map each point to an equivalent thermal warm dark matter particle mass $m_\mathrm{th}$ via linear-theory transfer function fitting with cosmological structure-formation Boltzmann solver. This enables a direct reinterpretation of state-of-the-art structure-formation limits from Milky Way satellites, strong lensing, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These limits, in conjunction with X-ray decay searches, as well as results from a wide variety of particle physics experiments allow for a more complete examination of these models. We find that these vector-mediated models are ruled out when the full combination of current constraints, listed above, are taken into account. NSI scalar-mediated models and models with low-reheating temperatures remain viable.</description>

      <title>Enhancing di-jet resonance searches via a final-state radiation jet tagging algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the possibility of enhancing the di-jet resonance searches by tagging the final state radiation (FSR) jet, using an event-level deep neural network. It is found that solely relying on the 4-momenta of the leading three jets allows the algorithm to achieve good discriminating power that can identify the hardest FSR jet in signal, while rejecting other soft jets. Once the invariant mass is corrected with the tagged FSR jet, the mass resolution of the signal is greatly enhanced, and the sensitivity of the search is also improved by more than 10%. By crafting the input variables carefully, the algorithm introduces minimal mass sculpting for the background, and its applicability extends to a broad mass range. This work proves that FSR jet tagging can potentially enhance the di-jet resonance searches, suiting various stages of the physics programmes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).</description>

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of proposed CEPC and FCC-ee with a center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV to long-lived dark photons heavier than 2 GeV that are pair-produced via the prompt decays of a light scalar mixed with the Standard-Model Higgs boson. We compute the production and decay rates of both the light scalar and the dark photon, and develop two search strategies targeting displaced vertices within the inner tracker of the main detectors. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the signal acceptance and projected sensitivity for each strategy. Our results show that, for the scalar-Higgs mixing angle set at $10^{-2}$ just below the current upper limit, the proposed searches at CEPC and FCC-ee can probe dark-photon kinetic-mixing parameter several orders of magnitude below existing bounds, for dark photons lighter than half the dark-scalar mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe remains one of the central open problems in particle physics and cosmology. We identify a new regime of \emph{hybrid resonant leptogenesis} in renormalizable SO(10) grand unified theories, where a quasi-degeneracy between the scalar triplet and the heaviest right-handed neutrino, \( M_T \simeq M_{N_3}, \) induces an unavoidable interference between type-I and type-II decay amplitudes. This interference gives rise to a physical CP-violating phase, \( \phi_{\rm HR} = \arg(\mu f Y_\nu^\dagger), \) which cannot be removed by field redefinitions and leads to a resonant enhancement of the baryon asymmetry without extreme Yukawa hierarchies or tuning. We show that the observed asymmetry, \( Y_B \simeq 8.7 \times 10^{-11}, \) is naturally reproduced for masses around \(10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}\), moderate washout, and \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) phases. The mechanism is predictive and testable, with correlated implications for lepton-flavour violation and electric dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetic effect amplified baryogenesis at first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we show that, in the background of the primordial magnetic field, the chiral magnetic effect effect can significantly amplify the chiral chemical potential sourced by the CP violation near the bubble walls during the first-order electroweak phase transition. This effect can lift the generated baryon asymmetry by several orders, and make it possible to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe with a CPV in the fermion sector far beyond the limitation of the electron dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phenomenologically emergent dark energy model: is non-zero equation of state of dark matter favored by DESI DR2?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Fermion selective tests of new physics with the bound electron g-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of high-precision measurements of the $g$ factor of single-electron ions is considered as a detailed probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. The contribution of the exchange of a hypothetical force-carrying scalar boson to the $g$ factor is calculated for the ground state of H-like ions and used to derive bounds on the parameters of that force. Similarly to the isotope shift, we employ the nuclide shift, i.e. the difference for elements with different proton and/or neutron numbers, in order to increase the experimental sensitivity to the new physics contribution. In particular we find, combining available measurements with current precision with different ions, that the coupling constant for the interaction between an electron and a proton can be constrained up to three orders of magnitude better than with the best current atomic data and theory.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Scattering from Optically Levitated Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of levitated optomechanics has enabled precise force sensors that operate in the quantum measurement regime, opening up unique opportunities to search for new physics whose weak interactions may have evaded existing sensors. We demonstrate the detection of impulsive forces acting on optically levitated nanoparticles, where the dominant noise source is provided by measurement backaction. Using these sensors, we search for momentum transfers that may originate from scattering of passing particlelike dark matter. For dark matter that couples to Standard Model neutrons via a generic long-range interaction, this search constrains a range of models in the mass range $1$-$10^7~\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$, placing upper limits on single neutron coupling strength as low as $\leq 1 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95% confidence level. We also demonstrate the ability of using the inherent directional sensitivity of these sensors to separate possible dark matter signals from backgrounds. Future extensions of the techniques developed here can enable searches for light dark matter and massive neutrinos that can reach sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond existing searches.</description>

      <title>A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves induced by matter isocurvature in general cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expansion history and content of the Universe between the end of inflation and the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by matter isocurvature fluctuations in a generic perfect fluid background as a novel probe of the physics of the very early Universe. We analytically compute the induced GW kernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked isocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal is sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid dominating the early Universe after inflation. We find that the GW amplitude is enhanced for a soft equation of state. Our framework can be applied to dark matter isocurvature and models leading to early matter-dominated eras, such as primordial black holes and cosmological solitons.</description>

Abstract: The CMS Collaboration recently observed a pseudoscalar excess of top quark-antiquark ($t\bar{t}$) events near the production threshold. One possible interpretation involves the formation of a short-lived quasi-bound state of $t\bar{t}$. This proceeding summarizes the first presentation of the results at the 59th Rencontres de Moriond and outlines its potential implications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Meets Varying Electron Mass: Implications for Phantom Crossing and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.</description>

      <title>A volcanic chronosequence as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to study the cosmic-ray flux in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Cha\^ine des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark. This work establishes a new application of the paleo-detector technique for long-scale time-domain high-energy astrophysics and provides the direct scientific motivation for experimental efforts to measure these track records.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>
