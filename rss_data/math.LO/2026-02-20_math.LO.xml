      <title>More Derived Models in PFA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper makes significant progress towards resolving a conjecture relating strong forcing axioms like $PFA$ and the derived model at a limit of Woodin cardinals $\kappa$. In particular, using a concept called Covering Matrices, we show that the $\Theta$ of the derived model at $\kappa$ is strictly less than $\kappa^+$ under various circumstances; in particular, this shows that the conclusion holds under $PFA$ if $\kappa$ is a limit of Woodin cardinals of cofinality $\omega$ and the derived model does not satisfy $LSA$. Assuming a form of mouse capturing, we show that the derived model satisfies $AD_{\mathbb{R}}$ under $PFA$ when $\kappa$ is a regular limit of Woodin cardinals. If $\kappa$ is an indestructibly $(\kappa,\kappa^+)$-weakly compact limit of Woodin cardinals, then the derived model outright satisfies $AD_{\mathbb{R}}$.</description>

      <title>On $\mathscr{T}$-based orthomodular dynamic algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a categorical equivalence between the category $\mathbb{COL}$ of complete orthomodular lattices and the category $\mathscr{T}\mathbb{ODA}$ of $\mathscr{T}$-based orthomodular dynamic algebras. Complete orthomodular lattices serve as the static algebraic foundation for quantum logic, modeling the testable properties of quantum systems. In contrast, $\mathcal{T}$-based orthomodular dynamic algebras, which are specialized unital involutive quantales, formalize the composition and quantum-logical properties of quantum actions.
  This result refines prior connections between orthomodular lattices and dynamic algebras, provides a constructive bridge between static and dynamic quantum logic perspectives, and extends naturally to Hilbert lattices and broader quantum-theoretic structures.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of symmetric extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technique of symmetric extensions is derived from forcing and it is one of the most important tools for studying models without the Axiom of Choice. Despite being incredibly successful since the 1960s, our understanding of the technique remained fairly limited compared to the theory of forcing. Whereas forcing developed products and iterations, no serious attempts at developing any general framework for iterating symmetric extensions were presented before [10], where only finite support iterations are treated. In this paper we develop the theory of symmetric extensions including different types of iterations, quotients, equivalents, and the structural results that can be described in this language. In particular, we give a modern exposition to some of the important theorems of Grigorieff [3], study Kinna--Wagner Principles in symmetric extensions, and show that it is provable from $\mathsf{ZF}$ that every set lies in a symmetric extension of $\operatorname{HOD}$.</description>

      <title>Uniform interpolation with constructive diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform interpolation is a strong form of interpolation providing an interpretation of propositional quantifiers within a propositional logic. Pitts' seminal work establishes this property for intuitionistic propositional logic relying on a sequent calculus in which na\"ive backward proof-search terminates. This constructive approach has been adapted to a wide range of logics, including intuitionistic modal logics. Surprisingly, no intuitionistic modal logic with independent box and diamond has yet been shown to satisfy uniform interpolation. We fill in this gap by proving the uniform interpolation property for Constructive K (CK) and Wijesekera's K (WK). We build on Pitts' technique by exploiting existing terminating calculi for CK and WK, which we prove to eliminate cut, and formalise all our results in the proof assistant Rocq. Together, our results constitute the first positive uniform interpolation results for intuitionistic modal logics with diamond.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck's Geometric Universes and A Sheaf-Theoretic Foundation of Information Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an interpretation of Grothendieck's geometric universes as a foundational framework for \emph{information networks}. We argue that Grothendieck topologies, sheaves, and topoi provide a sheaf-theoretic semantics in which distributed and locally held information can be integrated into globally coherent structures. In this setting, local informational states are represented by sections, while the sheaf condition governs consistency, agreement, and consensus across a network. Logical validity and mathematical existence are therefore not imposed externally but arise intrinsically from geometric and categorical conditions. From this perspective, Grothendieck's geometric universes constitute a natural foundation for information networks governed by intrinsic logical principles. Moreover, we propose that Grothendieck's geometric universes themselves concretely instantiate what the author calls \emph{intrinsic logicism}. This position is intended as a contemporary reconstruction of the classical logicist program of Frege and Russell, reformulated within the framework of category theory and topos theory, where logical structure is generated internally by geometric and categorical organization rather than presupposed as an external foundational layer.</description>

      <title>Serre depth and local cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fundamental homological invariant, called \emph{Serre depth}, which stratifies Serre's conditions in the same way that depth stratifies the Cohen-Macaulay property. We study the Serre depths of modules over arbitrary Noetherian local rings and over standard graded algebras over a field, extending the polynomial ring case due to Muta and Terai. Under mild hypotheses, we show that the $r$-th Serre depth of a finitely generated module $M$ measures the deviation of $M$ from satisfying Serre's condition $(S_r)$. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows:
  (i) We establish the basic properties of Serre depth and prove that it is invariant under completion.
  (ii) If the base ring $R$ is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring, we show that a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ is equidimensional and satisfies $(S_r)$ if and only if its $r$-th Serre depth equals its Krull dimension. Analogous statements are obtained for schemes.
  (iii) For a homogeneous ideal in a standard graded polynomial ring over a field, we compare its Serre depths with those of its initial ideal.
  (iv) We characterize the Serre depths of a monomial ideal in terms of its skeletons and prove that the Serre depths of sufficiently large powers of a monomial ideal stabilize; the proof uses Presburger arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Finite Borel Asymptotic Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the set of locally finite Borel graphs with finite Borel asymptotic dimension is $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2$-complete. The result is based on a combinatorial characterization of finite Borel asymptotic dimension for graphs generated by a single Borel function. As an application of this characterization, we classify the complexities of digraph homomorphism problems for this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Ramsey's witnesses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Ramsey partition regularity, a generalisation of partition regularity involving infinitary configurations. We provide characterisations of this notion in terms of certain ultrafilters related to tensor products and dubbed Ramsey's witnesses; and we also consider their nonstandard counterparts as pairs of hypernatural numbers, called Ramsey pairs. These characterisations are then used to determine whether various configurations involving polynomials and exponentials are Ramsey partition regular over the natural numbers. In particular, this provides negative answers to several questions recently posed by Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson.</description>

      <title>Cardinals of the $P_\kappa(\lambda)$-Filter Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate forms of filter extension properties in the two-cardinal setting involving filters on $P_\kappa(\lambda)$. We generalize the filter games introduced by Holy and Schlicht in \cite{HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals} to filters on $P_\kappa(\lambda)$ and show that the existence of a winning strategy for Player II in a game of a certain length can be used to characterize several large cardinal notions such as: $\lambda$-super/strongly compact cardinals, $\lambda$-completely ineffable cardinals, nearly $\lambda$-super/strongly compact cardinals, and various notions of generic super and strong compactness. We generalize a result of Nielson from \cite{NielsenWelch:games_and_Ramsey-like_cardinals} connecting the existence of a winning strategy for Player II in a game of finite length and two-cardinal indescribability. We generalize the result of \cite{ForMagZem} to construct a fine $\kappa$-complete precipitous ideal on $P_\kappa(\lambda)$ from a winning strategy for Player II in a game of length $\omega$. Finally, we improve Theorems 1.2 and 1.4 from \cite{ForMagZem} and partially answer questions Q.1 and Q.2 from \cite{ForMagZem}.</description>

      <title>Abstract independence relations in neostability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework, in the style of Adler, for interpreting the notion of "witnessing" that has appeared (usually as a variant of Kim's Lemma) in different areas of neostability theory as a binary relation between abstract independence relations. This involves extending the relativisations of Kim-independence and Conant-independence due to Mutchnik to arbitrary independence relations.
  After developing this framework, we show that several results from simplicity, $\text{NTP}_2$, $\text{NSOP}_1$, and beyond follow as instances of general theorems for abstract independence relations. In particular, we prove the equivalence between witnessing and symmetry and the implications from this notion to chain local character and the weak independence theorem, and recover some partial converses. Finally, we use this framework to prove a dichotomy between $\text{NSOP}_1$ and Kruckman and Ramsey's $\text{BTP}$ that applies to most known $\text{NSOP}_4$ examples in the literature.</description>
