      <title>Ensuring connectedness for the Maximum Quasi-clique and Densest $k$-subgraph problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G$, a quasi-clique is a subgraph of $G$ whose density is at least $\gamma$ $(0 &lt; \gamma \leq 1)$. Two optimization problems can be defined for quasi-cliques: the Maximum Quasi-Clique (MQC) Problem, which finds a quasi-clique with maximum vertex cardinality, and the Densest $k$-Subgraph (DKS) Problem, which finds the densest subgraph given a fixed cardinality constraint. Most existing approaches to solve both problems often disregard the requirement of connectedness, which may lead to solutions containing isolated components that are meaningless for many real-life applications. To address this issue, we propose two flow-based connectedness constraints to be integrated into known Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations for either MQC or DKS problems. We compare the performance of MILP formulations enhanced with our connectedness constraints in terms of both running time and number of solved instances against existing approaches that ensure quasi-clique connectedness. Experimental results demonstrate that our constraints are quite competitive, making them valuable for practical applications requiring connectedness.</description>

      <title>Improved Dynamics for the Maximum Common Subgraph Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) problem plays a crucial role across various domains, bridging theoretical exploration and practical applications in fields like bioinformatics and social network analysis. Despite its wide applicability, MCS is notoriously challenging and is classified as an NP-Complete (NPC) problem. This study introduces new heuristics aimed at mitigating these challenges through the reformulation of the MCS problem as the Maximum Clique and its complement, the Maximum Independent Set. Our first heuristic leverages the Motzkin-Straus theorem to reformulate the Maximum Clique Problem as a constrained optimization problem, continuing the work of Pelillo in Replicator Equations, Maximal Cliques, and Graph Isomorphism (1999) with replicator dynamics and introducing annealed imitation heuristics as in Dominant Sets and Hierarchical Clustering (Pavan and Pelillo, 2003) to improve chances of convergence to better local optima. The second technique applies heuristics drawn upon strategies for the Maximum Independent Set problem to efficiently reduce graph sizes as used by Akiwa and Iwata in 2014. This enables faster computation and, in many instances, yields near-optimal solutions. Furthermore we look at the implementation of both techniques in a single algorithm and find that it is a promising approach. Our techniques were tested on randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph pairs. Results indicate the potential for application and substantial impact on future research directions.</description>

      <title>A Memetic Algorithm To Find a Hamiltonian Cycle in a Hamiltonian Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a memetic algorithm (\maa) approach for finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a Hamiltonian graph. The \ma is based on a proven approach to the Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (\atspp) that, in this contribution, is boosted by the introduction of more powerful local searches. Our approach also introduces a novel technique that sparsifies the input graph under consideration for Hamiltonicity and dynamically augments it during the search. Such a combined heuristic approach helps to prove Hamiltonicity by finding a Hamiltonian cycle in less time. In addition, we also employ a recently introduced polynomial-time reduction from the \hamcyc to the Symmetric \tsp, which is based on computing the transitive closure of the graph. Although our approach is a metaheuristic, i.e., it does not give a theoretical guarantee for finding a Hamiltonian cycle, we have observed that the method is successful in practice in verifying the Hamiltonicity of a larger number of instances from the \textit{Flinder University Hamiltonian Cycle Problem Challenge Set} (\fhcpsc), even for the graphs that have large treewidth. The experiments on the \fhcpscc instances and a computational comparison with five recent state-of-the-art baseline approaches show that the proposed method outperforms those for the majority of the instances in the \fhcpsc.</description>

      <title>Overlapping community detection algorithms using Modularity and the cosine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The issue of network community detection has been extensively studied across many fields. Most community detection methods assume that nodes belong to only one community. However, in many cases, nodes can belong to multiple communities simultaneously.This paper presents two overlapping network community detection algorithms that build on the two-step approach, using the extended modularity and cosine function. The applicability of our algorithms extends to both undirected and directed graph structures. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these algorithms, we conducted experiments using real data.</description>

      <title>Structural perspective on constraint-based learning of Markov networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov networks are probabilistic graphical models that employ undirected graphs to depict conditional independence relationships among variables. Our focus lies in constraint-based structure learning, which entails learning the undirected graph from data through the execution of conditional independence tests. We establish theoretical limits concerning two critical aspects of constraint-based learning of Markov networks: the number of tests and the sizes of the conditioning sets. These bounds uncover an exciting interplay between the structural properties of the graph and the amount of tests required to learn a Markov network. The starting point of our work is that the graph parameter maximum pairwise connectivity, $\kappa$, that is, the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths connecting a pair of vertices in the graph, is responsible for the sizes of independence tests required to learn the graph. On one hand, we show that at least one test with the size of the conditioning set at least $\kappa$ is always necessary. On the other hand, we prove that any graph can be learned by performing tests of size at most $\kappa$. This completely resolves the question of the minimum size of conditioning sets required to learn the graph. When it comes to the number of tests, our upper bound on the sizes of conditioning sets implies that every $n$-vertex graph can be learned by at most $n^{\kappa}$ tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $\kappa$. We show that for any upper bound $q$ on the sizes of the conditioning sets, there exist graphs with $O(n q)$ vertices that require at least $n^{\Omega(\kappa)}$ tests to learn. This lower bound holds even when the treewidth and the maximum degree of the graph are at most $\kappa+2$. On the positive side, we prove that every graph of bounded treewidth can be learned by a polynomial number of tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $2\kappa$.</description>

      <title>The q-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any positive integer $q\geq 2$ and any real number $\delta\in(0,1)$, let $\alpha_q(n,\delta n)$ denote the maximum size of a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ with minimum Hamming distance at least $\delta n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_q=\{0,1,\dotsc,q-1\}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The asymptotic rate function is defined by $ R_q(\delta) = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log_q\alpha_q(n,\delta n). $ The famous $q$-ary asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, obtained in the 1950s, states that \[ R_q(\delta) \geq 1 - \delta\log_q(q-1)-\delta\log_q\frac{1}{\delta}-(1-\delta)\log_q\frac{1}{1-\delta} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q) \] for all positive integers $q\geq 2$ and $0&lt;\delta&lt;1-q^{-1}$. In the case that $q$ is an even power of a prime with $q\geq 49$, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound was firstly improved by using algebraic geometry codes in the works of Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink and of Ihara in the 1980s. The further investigation in algebraic geometry codes has shown that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can also be improved in the case that $q$ is an odd power of a prime but not a prime with $q &gt; 125$. However, it remains a long-standing open problem whether the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound would be tight for those infinitely many integers $q$ which is a prime, except for Fermat primes not less than 257, and which is a generic positive integer not being a prime power.
  In this paper, we prove that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers $q\geq 2$. It is shown that $ R_q(1/2) &gt; R_\mathrm{GV}(1/2,q) $ for all integers $q &gt; \exp(29)$. Furthermore, we show that the growth of the rate function $R_q(\delta)$ for $\delta\in(0,1)$ fixed and $q$ growing large has a nontrivial lower bound. These new lower bounds are achieved by using codes from geometry of numbers introduced by Lenstra in the 1980s.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on the Complexity of Mixed-Integer Programs for Stable Set and Knapsack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard mixed-integer programming formulations for the stable set problem on $n$-node graphs require $n$ integer variables. We prove that this is almost optimal: We give a family of $n$-node graphs for which every polynomial-size MIP formulation requires $\Omega(n/\log^2 n)$ integer variables. By a polyhedral reduction we obtain an analogous result for $n$-item knapsack problems. In both cases, this improves the previously known bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ by Cevallos, Weltge &amp; Zenklusen (SODA 2018).
  To this end, we show that there exists a family of $n$-node graphs whose stable set polytopes satisfy the following: any $(1+\varepsilon/n)$-approximate extended formulation for these polytopes, for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, has size $2^{\Omega(n/\log n)}$. Our proof extends and simplifies the information-theoretic methods due to G\"o\"os, Jain &amp; Watson (FOCS 2016, SIAM J. Comput. 2018) who showed the same result for the case of exact extended formulations (i.e. $\varepsilon = 0$).</description>

      <title>A Lower bound for Secure Domination Number of an Outerplanar Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a secure dominating set of $G$ if $S$ is a dominating set of $G$ and, for each vertex $u \not\in S$, there is a vertex $v \in S$ such that $uv$ is an edge and $(S \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ is also a dominating set of $G$. The secure domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{s}(G)$, is the cardinality of a smallest secure dominating sets of $G$. In this paper, we prove that for any outerplanar graph with $n \geq 4$ vertices, $\gamma_{s}(G) \geq (n+4)/5$ and the bound is tight.</description>
