      <title>Comparison of Integration Methods for Cut Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an interface inserted in a background mesh is an alternative way of constructing a complex geometrical shape with a relative low meshing efforts. However, this process may require special treatment of elements cut by the interface. Our study focuses on comparing the integration of cut elements defined by implicit and parametric curves. We investigate the efficiency and robustness of open-source tools such as Algoim [5](a library for quadrature on implicitly defined geometries) and Ginkgo [2](a library for isogeometric analysis on Boolean operations with a parametric description) with numerical examples computing the area defined by the interface and benchmarks for 2D elasticity problem using the open-source code GeoPDEs [7]. It is concluded that none of the two interface descriptions is preferable with respect to the quality of the integration. Thus, the choice of the interface type depends only on the studied problem and the available curve description, but not on the numerical aspects of the integration.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of uncertainty quantification methods in gust response analysis of a Lift-Plus-Cruise eVTOL aircraft wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind gusts, being inherently stochastic, can significantly influence the safety and performance of aircraft. This study investigates a three-dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ) problem to explore how uncertainties in gust and flight conditions affect the structural response of a Lift-Plus-Cruise eVTOL aircraft wing. The analysis employs an unsteady aeroelastic model with a one-way coupling between a panel method aerodynamic solver and a shell analysis structural solver to predict the wing's response under varying conditions. Additionally, this paper presents a comparative evaluation of commonly used non-intrusive UQ methods, including non-intrusive polynomial chaos, kriging, Monte Carlo, univariate dimension reduction, and gradient-enhanced univariate dimension reduction. These methods are assessed based on their effectiveness in estimating various risk measures-mean, standard deviation, and 95th percentile-of critical structural response outputs such as maximum tip displacement and average strain energy. The numerical results reveal significant variability in the structural response outputs, even under relatively small ranges of uncertain inputs. This highlights the sensitivity of the system to uncertainties in gust and flight conditions. Furthermore, the performance of the implemented UQ methods varies significantly depending on the specific risk measures and the quantity of interest being analyzed.</description>

      <title>Advanced Displacement Magnitude Prediction in Multi-Material Architected Lattice Structure Beams Using Physics Informed Neural Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative method for predicting deformation in architected lattice structures that combines Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with finite element analysis. A thorough study was carried out on FCC-based lattice beams utilizing five different materials (Structural Steel, AA6061, AA7075, Ti6Al4V, and Inconel 718) under varied edge loads (1000-10000 N). The PINN model blends data-driven learning with physics-based limitations via a proprietary loss function, resulting in much higher prediction accuracy than linear regression. PINN outperforms linear regression, achieving greater R-square (0.7923 vs 0.5686) and lower error metrics (MSE: 0.00017417 vs 0.00036187). Among the materials examined, AA6061 had the highest displacement sensitivity (0.1014 mm at maximum load), while Inconel718 had better structural stability.</description>

      <title>Tree-Cotree-Based Tearing and Interconnecting for 3D Magnetostatics: A Dual-Primal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of electromagnetic devices with complex geometries and large-scale discrete systems benefits from advanced computational methods like IsoGeometric Analysis and Domain Decomposition. In this paper, we employ both concepts in an Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method to enable the use of parallel computations for magnetostatic problems. We address the underlying non-uniqueness by using a graph-theoretic approach, the tree-cotree decomposition. The classical tree-cotree gauging is adapted to be feasible for parallelization, which requires that all local subsystems are uniquely solvable. Our contribution consists of an explicit algorithm for constructing compatible trees and combining it with a dual-primal approach to enable parallelization. The correctness of the proposed approach is proved and verified by numerical experiments, showing its accuracy, scalability and optimal convergence.</description>

      <title>Clustering doc2vec output for topic-dimensionality reduction: A MITRE ATT&amp;CK calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to text classification by combining doc2vec embeddings with advanced clustering techniques to improve the analysis of specialized, high-dimensional textual data. We integrate unsupervised methods such as Louvain, K-means, and Spectral clustering with doc2vec to enhance the detection of semantic patterns across a large corpus. As a case study, we apply this methodology to cybersecurity risk analysis using the MITRE ATT\&amp;CK framework to structure and reduce the dimensionality of cyberattack tactics. Louvain clustering proved the most effective among the tested methods, achieving the best balance between cluster coherence and computational efficiency. Our approach identifies four "super tactics," demonstrating how clustering improves thematic coherence and risk attribution. The results validate the utility of combining doc2vec with clustering, particularly Louvain, for enhancing topic modeling and text classification.</description>

      <title>Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Fiber Orientation in Composite Molding Processes using Multilevel Polynomial Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber orientation is decisive for the mechanical properties and thus for the performance of composite materials. During manufacturing, variations in material and process parameters can significantly influence the exact fiber orientation. We employ multilevel polynomial surrogates to model the propagation of uncertain material properties in the injection molding process. To ensure reliable uncertainty quantification, a key focus is deriving novel error bounds for statistical measures of a quantity of interest, computed via these surrogates. To verify these bounds, we conduct numerical experiments using the Cross-WLF viscosity model alongside the Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel. In particular, the impact of uncertainties in fiber length and matrix temperature on the fractional anisotropy of fiber orientation is investigated. The Folgar-Tucker equation and the improved anisotropic rotary diffusion model are used, incorporating recently established analytical solutions of these models as part of our verification. Our results demonstrate that the investigated method significantly improves upon standard Monte Carlo estimation, while also providing error guarantees. These findings offer the first step toward a reliable and practical tool for optimizing fiber-reinforced polymer manufacturing processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Mixed-precision numerics in scientific applications: survey and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads has led to a significant increase in silicon area dedicated to lower-precision computations on recent high-performance computing hardware designs. However, mixed-precision capabilities, which can achieve performance improvements of 8x compared to double-precision in extreme compute-intensive workloads, remain largely untapped in most scientific applications. A growing number of efforts have shown that mixed-precision algorithmic innovations can deliver superior performance without sacrificing accuracy. These developments should prompt computational scientists to seriously consider whether their scientific modeling and simulation applications could benefit from the acceleration offered by new hardware and mixed-precision algorithms. In this article, we review the literature on relevant applications, existing mixed-precision algorithms, theories, and the available software infrastructure. We then offer our perspective and recommendations on the potential of mixed-precision algorithms to enhance the performance of scientific simulation applications. Broadly, we find that mixed-precision methods can have a large impact on computational science in terms of time-to-solution and energy consumption. This is true not only for a few arithmetic-dominated applications but also, to a more moderate extent, to the many memory bandwidth-bound applications. In many cases, though, the choice of algorithms and regions of applicability will be domain-specific, and thus require input from domain experts. It is helpful to identify cross-cutting computational motifs and their mixed-precision algorithms in this regard. Finally, there are new algorithms being developed to utilize AI hardware and and AI methods to accelerate first-principles computational science, and these should be closely watched as hardware platforms evolve.</description>

      <title>Impact of spatial coarsening on Parareal convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Parareal parallel-in-time integration method often performs poorly when applied to hyperbolic partial differential equations. This effect is even more pronounced when the coarse propagator uses a reduced spatial resolution. However, some combinations of spatial discretization and numerical time stepping nevertheless allow for Parareal to converge with monotonically decreasing errors. This raises the question how these configurations can be distinguished theoretically from those where the error initially increases, sometimes over many orders of magnitude. For linear problems, we prove a theorem that implies that the 2-norm of the Parareal iteration matrix is not a suitable tool to predict convergence for hyperbolic problems when spatial coarsening is used. We then show numerical results that suggest that the pseudo-spectral radius can reliably indicate if a given configuration of Parareal will show transient growth or monotonic convergence. For the studied examples, it also provides a good quantitative estimate of the convergence rate in the first few Parareal iterations.</description>
