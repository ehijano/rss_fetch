      <title>A Brief Discussion on the Philosophical Principles and Development Directions of Data Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16719</link>

Abstract: The data circulation is a complex scenario involving a large number of participants and different types of requirements, which not only has to comply with the laws and regulations, but also faces multiple challenges in technical and business areas. In order to systematically and comprehensively address these issues, it is essential to have a comprehensive and profound understanding of 'data circulation'.
  The traditional analysis method tends to proceed based on the traditional circulation model of commodities, that is, tangible objects, which has some defects and shortcomings, and tends to be a formalized approach, which is faced numerous challenges in practice. This paper analyzes the circulation of data with a philosophical approach, obtains the new explication of data and executing entity, and provides a new definition of the concepts of data utilization and data key stakeholders (objects). At the same time, it puts forward the idea of ``data alienation'', and constructs a new interpretive framework of ``data circulation''.
  Based on the framework of this interpretation, it is clearly proposed that ``data alienation'' is the core of ``data circulation'', benefit distribution is the driving force, and legal compliance is the foundation, and further discussed the three modes of ``data circulation''. It further discusses the three modes of ``data circulation''. It is pointed out that ``data circulation'' is different from traditional ``commodity circulation''. To achieve ``data circulation'',a comprehensive information infrastructure needs to be established. from a theoretical point of view, it lays a solid foundation for the development of ``data circulation''.</description>
