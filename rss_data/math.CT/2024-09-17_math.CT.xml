      <title>Generalised 6j symbols over the category of $G$-graded vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any choice of a spherical fusion category defines an invariant of oriented closed 3-manifolds, which is computed by choosing a triangulation of the manifold and considering a state sum model that assigns a 6j symbol to every tetrahedron in this triangulation. This approach has been generalized to oriented closed 3-manifolds with defect data by Meusburger. In a recent paper, she constructed a family of invariants for such manifolds parametrised by the choice of certain spherical fusion categories, bimodule categories, finite bimodule functors and module natural transformations. Meusburger defined generalised 6j symbols for these objects, and introduces a state sum model that assigns a generalised 6j symbol to every tetrahedron in the triangulation of a manifold with defect data, where the type of 6j symbol used depends on what defect data occur within the tetrahedron. The present work provides non-trivial examples of suitable bimodule categories, bimodule functors and module natural transformation, all over categories of $G$-graded vector spaces. Our main result is the description of module functors in terms of matrices, which allows us to classify these functors when $G$ is a finite cyclic group. Furthermore, we calculate the generalised 6j symbols for categories of $G$-graded vector spaces, (bi-)module categories over such categories and (bi-)module functors.</description>

      <title>Multivariate functorial difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial difference operators for a large class of functors between presheaf categories are introduced, extending our difference operator from \cite{Par24} to the multivariable case. These combine into the Jacobian profunctor which provides the setting for a lax chain rule. We introduce a functorial version of multivariable Newton series whose aim is to recover a functor from its iterated differences. Not all functors are recovered but we get a best approximation in the form of a left adjoint, and the induced comonad is idempotent. Its fixed points are what we call soft analytic functors, a generalization of the multivariable analytic functors of Fiore et al.~\cite{FioGamHylWin08}.</description>

      <title>Unbiased multicategory theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an unbiased theory of symmetric multicategories, where sequences are replaced by families. To be effective, this approach requires an explicit consideration of indexing and reindexing of objects and arrows, handled by the double category $\dPb$ of pullback squares in finite sets: a symmetric multicategory is a sum preserving discrete fibration of double categories $M: \dM\to \dPb$. If the \"loose" part of $M$ is an opfibration we get unbiased symmetric monoidal categories.
  The definition can be usefully generalized by replacing $\dPb$ with another double prop $\dP$, as an indexing base, giving $\dP$-multicategories. For instance, we can remove the finiteness condition to obtain infinitary symmetric multicategories, or enhance $\dPb$ by totally ordering the fibers of its loose arrows to obtain plain multicategories.
  We show how several concepts and properties find a natural setting in this framework. We also consider cartesian multicategories as algebras for a monad $(-)^\cart$ on $\sMlt$, where the loose arrows of $\dM^\cart$ are \"spans" of a tight and a loose arrow in $\dM$.</description>

      <title>Directed equality with dinaturality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how dinaturality plays a central role in the interpretation of directed type theory where types are interpreted as (1-)categories and directed equality is represented by $\hom$-functors. We present a general elimination principle based on dinaturality for directed equality which very closely resembles the $J$-rule used in Martin-L\"of type theory, and we highlight which syntactical restrictions are needed to interpret this rule in the context of directed equality. We then use these rules to characterize directed equality as a left relative adjoint to a functor between (para)categories of dinatural transformations which contracts together two variables appearing naturally with a single dinatural one, with the relative functor imposing the syntactic restrictions needed. We then argue that the quantifiers of such a directed type theory should be interpreted as ends and coends, which dinaturality allows us to present in adjoint-like correspondences to a weakening functor. Using these rules we give a formal interpretation to Yoneda reductions and (co)end calculus, and we use logical derivations to prove the Fubini rule for quantifier exchange, the adjointness property of Kan extensions via (co)ends, exponential objects of presheaves, and the (co)Yoneda lemma. We show transitivity (composition), congruence (functoriality), and transport (coYoneda) for directed equality by closely following the same approach of Martin-L\"of type theory, with the notable exception of symmetry. We formalize our main theorems in Agda.</description>

      <title>A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms "every monomorphism is a kernel" and "every epimorphism is a cokernel" of an abelian category to $n$-abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring is $n$-abelian. Moreover, we establish a correspondence for $n$-abelian categories with additive generators, which extends the higher Auslander correspondence.</description>

      <title>Counting in Calabi--Yau categories, with applications to Hall algebras and knot polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that homotopy cardinality -- a priori ill-defined for many dg-categories, including all periodic ones -- has a reasonable definition for even-dimensional Calabi--Yau (evenCY) categories and their relative generalizations (under appropriate finiteness conditions).
  As a first application we solve the problem of defining an intrinsic Hall algebra for degreewise finite pre-triangulated dg-categories in the case of oddCY categories. We compare this definition with To\"en's derived Hall algebras (in case they are well-defined) and with other approaches based on extended Hall algebras and central reduction, including a construction of Hall algebras associated with Calabi--Yau triples of triangulated categories. For a category equivalent to the root category of a 1CY abelian category $\mathcal A$, the algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the Drinfeld double of the twisted Ringel--Hall algebra of $\mathcal A$, thus resolving in the Calabi--Yau case the long-standing problem of realizing the latter as a Hall algebra intrinsically defined for such a triangulated category.
  Our second application is the proof of a conjecture of Ng--Rutherford--Shende--Sivek, which provides an intrinsic formula for the ruling polynomial of a Legendrian knot $L$, and its generalization to Legendrian tangles, in terms of the augmentation category of $L$.</description>

      <title>Constructing linear bicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearly distributive categories were introduced to model the tensor/par fragment of linear logic, without resorting to the use of negation. Linear bicategories are the bicategorical version of linearly distributive categories. Essentially, a linear bicategory has two forms of composition, each determining the structure of a bicategory, and the two compositions are related by a linear distribution.
  While it is standard in the field of monoidal topology that the category of quantale-valued relations is a bicategory, we begin by showing that if the quantale is a Girard quantale, we obtain a linear bicategory. We further show that the category $QRel$ for $Q$ a unital quantale is a Girard quantaloid if and only if $Q$ is a Girard quantale. The tropical and arctic semiring structures fit together into a Girard quantale, so this construction is likely to have multiple applications. More generally, we define LD-quantales, which are sup-lattices with two quantale structures related by a linear distribution, and show that $QRel$ is a linear bicategory if $Q$ is an LD-quantale.
  We then consider several standard constructions from bicategory theory, and show that these lift to the linear bicategory setting and produce new examples of linear bicategories. In particular, we consider quantaloids. We first define the notion of a linear quantaloid ${\cal Q}$ and then consider linear ${\cal Q}$-categories and linear monads in ${\cal Q}$, where ${\cal Q}$ is a linear quantaloid. Every linear quantaloid is a linear bicategory.
  We also consider the bicategory whose objects are locales, 1-cells are bimodules and two-cells are bimodule homomorphisms. This bicategory turns out to be what we call a Girard bicategory, which are in essence a closed version of linear bicategories.</description>

      <title>Expanding \v{C}ech cohomology for quantales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand \v{C}ech cohomology of a topological space $X$ with values in a presheaf on $X$ to \v{C}ech cohomology of a commutative ring with unity $R$ with values in a presheaf on $R$. The strategy is to observe that both the set of open subsets of $X$ and the set of ideals of $R$ provide examples of a (semicartesian) quantale. We study a particular pair of (adjoint) functors $(\theta, \tau)$ between the quantale of open subsets of $X$ and the quantale of ideals of $C(X)$, the ring of real-valued continuous functions on $X$. This leads to the main result of this paper: the $q$th \v{C}ech cohomology groups of $X$ with values on the constant sheaf $F$ on $X$ is isomorphic to the $q$th \v{C}ech cohomology groups of the ring $C(X)$ with values on a sheaf $F \circ \tau$ on $C(X)$.</description>

      <title>Enriched Grothendieck topologies under change of base</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of a monoidal adjunction between locally finitely presentable B\'{e}nabou cosmoi $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$, we examine the behavior of enriched coverages on a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category $\mathcal{U}$, and that of their constituent covering sieves, under the change of enriching category induced by the right adjoint $G : \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{U}$ of the pair. We exhibit a construction of a $\mathcal{U}$-Grothendieck topology on $\mathcal{C}$ given a $\mathcal{V}$-Grothendieck topology, and prove in particular that when $G$ is faithful and conservative, any upward-directed $\mathcal{V}$-coverage on $\mathcal{C}$ corresponds uniquely to an upward-directed $\mathcal{U}$-coverage on $G_*\mathcal{C}$. We show that when $G$ is fully faithful, base change commutes with enriched sheafification in the sense of Borceux-Quinteiro.</description>

      <title>Higher Verlinde Categories: The Mixed Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, the higher Verlinde categories $\mathrm{Ver}_{p^n}$ are obtained by taking the abelian envelope of quotients of the category of tilting modules for the algebraic group $\mathrm{SL}_2$. These symmetric tensor categories have been introduced in arXiv:2003.10499 &amp; arXiv:2003.10105, and their properties have been extensively studied in the former reference. In arXiv:2105.07724, the above construction for $\mathrm{SL}_2$ has been generalized to Lusztig's quantum group for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and root of unity $\zeta$, which produces the mixed higher Verlinde categories $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$. Inspired by the results of arXiv:2003.10499, we study the properties of these braided tensor categories in detail. In particular, we establish a Steinberg tensor product formula for the simple objects of $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$, construct a braided embedding $\mathrm{Ver}_{p^n}\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n+1)}}$, compute the symmetric center of $\mathrm{Ver}^{\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$, and identify its Grothendieck ring.</description>
