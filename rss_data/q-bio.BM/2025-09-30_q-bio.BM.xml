      <title>Discontinuous Epitope Fragments as Sufficient Target Templates for Efficient Binder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in structure-based protein design have accelerated de novo binder generation, yet interfaces on large domains or spanning multiple domains remain challenging due to high computational cost and declining success with increasing target size. We hypothesized that protein folding neural networks (PFNNs) operate in a ``local-first'' manner, prioritizing local interactions while displaying limited sensitivity to global foldability.Guided by this hypothesis, we propose an epitope-only strategy that retains only the discontinuous surface residues surrounding the binding site. Compared to intact-domain workflows, this approach improves in silico success rates by up to 80% and reduces the average time per successful design by up to forty-fold, enabling binder design against previously intractable targets such as ClpP and ALS3. Building on this foundation, we further developed a tailored pipeline that incorporates a Monte Carlo-based evolution step to overcome local minima and a position-specific biased inverse folding step to refine sequence patterns. Together, these advances not only establish a generalizable framework for efficient binder design against structurally large and otherwise inaccessible targets, but also support the broader ``local-first'' hypothesis as a guiding principle for PFNN-based design.</description>

      <title>Marginal Girsanov Reweighting: Stable Variance Reduction via Neural Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering unbiased properties from biased or perturbed simulations is a central challenge in rare-event sampling. Classical Girsanov Reweighting (GR) offers a principled solution by yielding exact pathwise probability ratios between perturbed and reference processes. However, the variance of GR weights grows rapidly with time, rendering it impractical for long-horizon reweighting. We introduce Marginal Girsanov Reweighting (MGR), which mitigates variance explosion by marginalizing over intermediate paths, producing stable and scalable weights for long-timescale dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that MGR (i) accurately recovers kinetic properties from umbrella-sampling trajectories in molecular dynamics, and (ii) enables efficient Bayesian parameter inference for stochastic differential equations with temporally sparse observations.</description>

      <title>Commutative algebra neural network reveals genetic origins of diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic mutations can disrupt protein structure, stability, and solubility, contributing to a wide range of diseases. Existing predictive models often lack interpretability and fail to integrate physical and chemical interactions critical to molecular mechanisms. Moreover, current approaches treat disease association, stability changes, and solubility alterations as separate tasks, limiting model generalizability. In this study, we introduce a unified framework based on multiscale commutative algebra to capture intrinsic physical and chemical interactions for the first time. Leveraging Persistent Stanley-Reisner Theory, we extract multiscale algebraic invariants to build a Commutative Algebra neural Network (CANet). Integrated with transformer features and auxiliary physical features, we apply CANet to tackle three key domains for the first time: disease-associated mutations, mutation-induced protein stability changes, and solubility changes upon mutations. Across six benchmark tasks, CANet and its gradient boosting tree counterpart, CATree, consistently attain state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in predictive accuracy. Our approach offers multiscale, mechanistic, interpretable,and generalizable models for predicting disease-mutation associations.</description>

      <title>MarS-FM: Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics via Markov State Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues) with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events, and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing methods, often by a substantial margin.</description>
