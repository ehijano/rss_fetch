      <title>A uniqueness theorem for nonvariational solutions of the Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bounded open subset $\Omega$ of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in]0,1[$, and we define a distributional outward unit normal derivative for $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous solutions of the Helmholtz equation in the exterior of $\Omega$ that may not have a classical outward unit normal derivative at the boundary points of $\Omega$ and that may have an infinite Dirichlet integral around the boundary of $\Omega$. Namely for solutions that do not belong to the classical variational setting. Then we show a Schauder boundary regularity result for $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions that have the Laplace operator in a Schauder space of negative exponent and we prove a uniqueness theorem for $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous solutions of the exterior Dirichlet and impedance boundary value problems for the Helmholtz equation that satisfy the Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity in the above mentioned nonvariational setting.</description>

      <title>Local Lipschitz continuity of the minimizers of nonuniformly convex functionals under the Lower Bounded Slope Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the local Lipschitz regularity of the minimizers of functionals of the form \[ \mathcal I(u)=\int_\Omega f(\nabla u(x))+g(x)u(x)\,dx\qquad u\in\phi+W^{1,1}_0(\Omega) \] where $g$ is bounded and $\phi$ satisfies the Lower Bounded Slope Condition. The function $f$ is assumed to be convex but not uniformly convex everywhere. As byproduct, we also prove the existence of a locally Lipschitz minimizer for a class of functionals of the type above but allowing to the function $f$ to be nonconvex.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the Cauchy problem for the spatially inhomogeneous Landau equation with soft potential in the perturbative framework around the Maxwellian distribution. Under a smallness assumption on the initial datum with exponential decay in the velocity variable, we establish the optimal Gevrey Gelfand-Shilov regularizing effect for the solution to the Cauchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the equivalence between superharmonic functions and locally renormalized solutions for the elliptic measure data problems with $(p, q)$-growth. By showing that locally renormalized solutions are essentially bounded below and using Wolff potential estimates, we extend the results of [T. Kilpel\"{a}inen, T. Kuusi, A. Tuhola-Kujanp\"{a}\"{a}, Superharmonic functions are locally renormalized solutions, Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'{e} C Anal. Non Lin\'{e}aire, 2011] to a broader class of problems. Our work provides the first equivalence result between locally renormalized solutions and superharmonic functions for the nonstandard growth equations.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for an instantaneous and non-instantaneous fourth-order differential system with local assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of fourth-order differential systems with instantaneous and non-instantaneous impulses. Our technical approach is mainly based on a variant of Clark's theorem without the global assumptions. Under locally subquadratic growth conditions imposed on the nonlinear terms $f_i(t,u)$ and impulsive terms $I_i$, combined with perturbations governed by arbitrary continuous functions of small coefficient $\varepsilon$, we establish the existence of multiple small solutions. Specifically, the system exhibits infinitely many solutions in the case where $\varepsilon=0$.</description>

      <title>Ground state and multiple normalized solutions of quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations in the $L^2$-supercritical case and the Sobolev critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the existence of normalized solutions for the following quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned}
  -\Delta u-u\Delta u^2 +\lambda u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad\mathrm{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{N}, \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $N=3,4$, $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier and $p \in (4+\frac{4}{N},2\cdot2^*]$. The solutions correspond to critical points of the energy functional subject to the $L^2$-norm constraint $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2dx=a^2&gt;0$. In the Sobolev critical case $p=2\cdot 2^*$, the energy functional has no critical point. As for $L^2$-supercritical case $p \in (4+\frac{4}{N},2\cdot2^*)$: on the one hand, taking into account Pohozaev manifold and perturbation method, we obtain the existence of ground state normalized solutions for the non-radial case; on the other hand, we get the existence of infinitely many normalized solutions in $H^1_r(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Moreover, our results cover several relevant existing results. And in the end, we get the asymptotic properties of energy as $a$ tends to $+\infty$ and $a$ tends to $0^+$.</description>

      <title>The vanishing discount problem for nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a convergence result for the vanishing discount problem in the context of nonlocal HJ equations. We consider a fairly general class of discounted first-order and convex HJ equations which incorporate an integro-differential operator posed on the $d$-dimensional torus, and we show that the solutions converge to a specific critical solution as the discount factor tends to zero. Our approach relies on duality techniques for nonlocal convex HJ equations, building upon Hahn-Banach separation theorems to develop a generalized notion of Mather measure. The results are applied to a specific class of convex and superlinear Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Threshold, subthreshold and global unbounded solutions of superlinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear heat equation with a superlinear nonlinearity and we study the properties of threshold or subthreshold solutions, lying on or below the boundary between blow-up and global existence, respectively. For the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem, we prove the boundedness of any subthreshold solution. This implies, in particular, that all global unbounded solutions -- if they exist -- are threshold solutions. For the Cauchy problem, these properties fail in general but we show that they become true for a suitably modified notion of threshold. Our results strongly improve known results even in the model case of power nonlinearities, especially in the Sobolev critical and supercritical cases.</description>

      <title>Sharp Asymptotic Behavior of the Steady Pressure-free Prandtl system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11870v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the steady pressure-free Prandtl system. By employing a modified von Mises transformation, we rigorously prove the far-field convergence of Prandtl solutions to Blasius flow. A weighted energy method is employed to establish the optimal convergence rate assuming that the initial data constitutes a perturbation of the Blasius profile. Furthermore, a sharp maximum principle technique is applied to derive the optimal convergence rate for concave initial data. The critical weights and comparison functions depend on the first eigenfunction of the linearized operator associated with the system.</description>

      <title>Generic regularity in time for solutions of the Stefan problem in 4+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the free boundary of a solution of the Stefan problem in $\mathbb R^{4+1}$ is a $3$-dimensional manifold of class $C^\infty$ in $\mathbb R^4$ for almost every time. This is achieved by showing that for all dimensions $n$ the singular set $\Sigma\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$ can be decomposed in two parts $\Sigma=\Sigma^\infty\cup \Sigma^*$, where $\Sigma^\infty$ is covered by one $(n-1)$-dimensional manifold of class $C^\infty$ in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ and its projection onto the time axis has Hausdorff dimension 0, while $\Sigma^*$ is parabolically countably $(n-2)$-rectifiable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the two-dimensional compressible magneto-micropolar boundary layer equations on the half-plane, which are derived from 2D compressible magneto-micropolar fluid equations with the non-slip boundary condition on velocity, Dirichlet boundary condition on micro-rotational velocity and perfectly conducting boundary condition on magnetic field. Based on a nonlinear coordinate transformation proposed in \cite{LXY2019}, we first prove the local-in-time well-posedness for the compressible magneto-micropolar boundary layer system in Sobolev spaces, provided that initial tangential magnetic field is non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of the Symmetry Groups of Monge-Amp\`{e}re Equation and Affine Maximal type Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The affine maximal type hypersurface has been a core topic in Affine Geometry. When the hypersurface is presented as a regular graph of a convex function $u$, the statement that the graph is of affine maximal type is equivalent to the statement that $u$ satisfies the fully nonlinear partial differential equation
  $$
  D_{ij}(U^{ij}w)=0, \ \ w\equiv[\det D^2u]^{-\theta}, \ \ \theta&gt;0, \ \ \forall x\in{\mathbb{R}}^N
  $$ of fourth order. This equation can be regarded as a generalization of the $N$-dimensional Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation
  $$
  \det D^2u=1, \ \ \forall x\in{\mathbb{R}}^N
  $$ of second order, since each solution of Monge-Amp\`{e}re Equation satisfies affine maximal type equation automatically. In this paper, we will determine the symmetry groups of these two important fully nonlinear equations without asymptotic growth assumption. Our method develops the Lie's theory to fully nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify shortcomings in two popular measures of localization of functions: the $L^p-L^q$ participation ratio and the mass concentration comparison. We then introduce a novel localization measure for functions on bounded subsets of $\mathbf{R}^d$, $d=1,2,3,\dots$, based on a Wasserstein metric. For efficient computation, we prove the equality of this measure with a suitable Sobolev norm in dimension one. We demonstrate our approach by numerical experiments in one and two dimensions. Finally, we discuss and mitigate challenges arising from boundary effects.</description>

      <title>Green's functions of the fractional Laplacian on a square -- boundary considerations and applications to the L\'{e}vy flight narrow capture problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the unit square, we introduce a method for accurately computing source-neutral Green's functions of the fractional Laplacian operator with either periodic or homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. This method involves analytically constructing the singular behavior of the Green's function in a neighborhood around the location of the singularity, and then formulating a ``smooth'' problem for the remainder term. This smooth problem can be solved for numerically using a basic finite difference scheme. This approach allows immediate and accurate extraction of the regular part of the Green's function (and its gradient, if so desired). We apply this tool to gain insights into the narrow capture problem on the unit square, where a particle undergoing a L\'{e}vy flight of index $\alpha \in (0,1)$ searches for small target(s) of radius $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ for $0 &lt; \varepsilon \ll 1$. In the case of Neumann boundary conditions, we provide a physical interpretation for how the particle interacts with the boundary. Using a matched asymptotic method, we compute a two-term expansion for the average search time, where the second order term is computed in terms of Green's functions, encoding both boundary effects (in the Neumann case) as well as how the targets are distributed within the search domain. We also illustrate through an analysis of splitting probabilities how a desired ``target'' can be ``shielded'' by ``obstacle'' targets, and how this shielding effect is lessened for decreasing $\alpha$. As in the case of the search time problem, this shielding effect is encoded in a correction term requiring accurate computation of Green's functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of a perturbed circular interface for the two-phase Mullins-Sekerka evolution in flat two-dimensional space. Our method is based on the gradient flow structure of the evolution and captures two distinct regimes of the dynamics, an initial - and novel - phase of algebraic-in-time decay and a later - and previously explored - phase of exponential-in-time decay. By quantifying the initial phase of relaxation, our method allows for the investigation of systems with large initial dissipation as long as the isoperimetric deficit is small enough. We include quantitative estimates of the solution in terms of its initial data, including the $C^{1}$-distance to the center manifold of circles and the displacement of the barycenter.</description>

      <title>Analysis of steady-state solutions to a vasculogenesis model in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady state solutions of a vasculogenesis model governed by coupled partial differential equations in a bounded two dimensional domain. Explicit steady state solutions are analytically constructed, and their stability is rigorously analyzed under prescribed initial and boundary conditions. By employing the energy method, we prove that these solutions exhibit local asymptotic stability when specific parametric criteria are satisfied. The analysis establishes a direct connection between the stability thresholds and the system's diffusion coefficient, offering quantitative insights into the mechanisms governing pattern formation. These results provide foundational theoretical advances for understanding self organization in chemotaxis-driven biological systems, particularly vasculogenesis.</description>

      <title>Traveling wave profiles for a semi-discrete Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look for traveling waves of the semi-discrete conservation law $4\dot u_j +u_{j+1}^2-u_{j-1}^2 = 0$, using variational principles related to concepts of ``hidden convexity'' appearing in recent studies of various PDE (partial differential equations). We analyze and numerically compute with two variational formulations related to dual convex optimization problems constrained by either the differential-difference equation (DDE) or nonlinear integral equation (NIE) that wave profiles should satisfy. We prove existence theorems conditional on the existence of extrema that satisfy a strict convexity criterion, and numerically exhibit a variety of localized, periodic and non-periodic wave phenomena.</description>

      <title>Finite time blowup for Keller-Segel equation with logistic damping in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Keller-Segel equation, a classical chemotaxis model, and many of its variants have been extensively studied for decades. In this work, we focus on 3D Keller-Segel equation with a quadratic logistic damping term $-\mu \rho^2$ (modeling density-dependent mortality rate) and show the existence of finite-time blowup solutions with nonnegative density and finite mass for any $\mu \in \big[0,\frac{1}{3}\big)$. This range of $\mu$ is sharp; for $\mu \ge \frac{1}{3}$, the logistic damping effect suppresses the blowup as shown in [Kang-Stevens, 2016] and [Tello-Winkler, 2007]. A key ingredient is to construct a self-similar blowup solution to a related aggregation equation as an approximate solution, with subcritical scaling relative to the original model. Based on this construction, we employ a robust weighted $L^2$ method to prove the stability of this approximate solution, where modulation ODEs are introduced to enforce local vanishing conditions for the perturbation lying in a singular-weighted $L^2$ space. As a byproduct, we exhibit a new family of type I blowup mechanisms for the classical 3D Keller-Segel equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse applications, including medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The inverse problem of reconstructing internal electrical conductivity from boundary measurements is nonlinear and highly ill-posed, making it difficult to solve accurately. In recent years, there has been growing interest in combining analytical methods with machine learning to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the convex hull of inclusions from boundary measurements by combining the enclosure method proposed by Ikehata with neural networks. We demonstrate its performance using experimental data. Compared to the classical enclosure method with least squares fitting, the learned convex hull achieves superior performance on both simulated and experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive sharp two side heat kernel estimate on exterior $C^{1,1}$ domains in the plane, and sharp upper heat kernel bound on exterior $C^{1,\mathrm{Dini}}$ domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$. Estimates for Green's function and Riesz potentials on exterior domains in the plane are also presented. Based on the heat kernel estimates, we show the boundedness of the fractional Riesz transforms on exterior $C^{1,\mathrm{Dini}}$ domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$. Some further applications to product and chain rules and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation are also presented.</description>

      <title>Stability for linearized gravity on the Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.03859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove integrated energy and pointwise decay estimates for solutions of the vacuum linearized Einstein equation on the domain of outer communication of the Kerr black hole spacetime. The estimates are valid for the full subextreme range of Kerr black holes, provided integrated energy estimates for the Teukolsky equation hold. For slowly rotating Kerr backgrounds, such estimates are known to hold, due to the work of one of the authors. The results in this paper thus provide the first stability results for linearized gravity on the Kerr background, in the slowly rotating case, and reduce the linearized stability problem for the full subextreme range to proving integrated energy estimates for the Teukolsky equation. This constitutes an essential step towards a proof of the black hole stability conjecture, i.e. the statement that the Kerr family is dynamically stable, one of the central open problems in general relativity.</description>

      <title>New results on the global solvability and blow-up for a class of weakly dissipative Camassa-Holm equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.01843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for a class of weakly dissipative Camassa-Holm equations in nonhomogeneous Besov spaces. First, we prove that the Cauchy problem admits a unique global strong solution in Besov spaces with proper condition on the dissipation parameter $\lambda&gt;0$. The novel ingredients in the proof lies in transforming the equations into a class of damped Camassa-Holm equations, and performing a non-standard iterative method. It is shown that our result holds for the damped equations with more general time-dependent parameters, which improves the existed results from Sobolev spaces to Besov spaces without assuming any sign condition on the initial data. Second, we derive two kinds of blow-up criteria in suitable Sobolev spaces, which in some sense inform us how the dissipation parameter $\lambda$ influences the singularity formation of strong solutions.</description>

      <title>On a Hardy-Morrey inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morrey's classical inequality implies the H\"older continuity of a function whose gradient is sufficiently integrable. Another consequence is the Hardy-type inequality $$ \lambda\biggl\|\frac{u}{d_\Omega^{1-n/p}}\biggr\|_{\infty}^p\le \int_\Omega |Du|^p \,dx $$ for any open set $\Omega\subsetneq \mathbb{R}^n$. This inequality is valid for functions supported in $\Omega$ and with $\lambda$ a positive constant independent of $u$. The crucial hypothesis is that the exponent $p$ exceeds the dimension $n$. This paper aims to develop a basic theory for this inequality and the associated variational problem. In particular, we study the relationship between the geometry of $\Omega$, sharp constants, and the existence of a nontrivial $u$ which saturates the inequality.</description>

      <title>Optimal stability of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev and Sobolev inequalities of arbitrary orders with dimension-dependent constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Dolbeault-Esteban-Figalli-Frank-Loss [20] established the optimal stability of the first-order $L^2$-Sobolev inequality with dimension-dependent constant. Subsequently, Chen-Lu-Tang [18] obtained the optimal stability for the $L^2$ fractional Sobolev inequality of order $s$ when $0&lt;s&lt;1$.This paper considers the remaining case $1&lt;s&lt;\frac{n}{2}$. Our strategy is to first establish the optimal stability for the HLS inequality directly without using the stability of the Sobolev inequality. The main difficulty lies in establishing the optimal local stability of HLS inequality when $1&lt;s&lt;\frac{n}{2}$. The loss of the Hilbert structure of the distance appearing in the stability of the HLS inequality brings challenge in establishing the desired stability. To achieve our goal, we develop a new strategy based on the $H^{-s}-$decomposition instead of $L^{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}-$decomposition to obtain the local stability of the HLS inequality with $L^{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}-$distance. However, new difficulties arise to deduce the global stability from the local stability because of the non-uniqueness and non-continuity of $\|r\|_{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}$ for the rearrangement flow.
  As an important application of the optimal stability of the HLS inequality together with the duality theory of the stability developed initially by Carlen [11] and further improved in [17], we deduce the optimal stability of the $L^2$-Sobolev inequality of order s when $1\le s&lt;\frac{n}{2}$ and the non-Hilbertian $L^{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}$-Sobolev inequality with the dimension-dependent constants. As another application, we can derive the optimal stability of Beckner's [5] restrictive Sobolev inequality on the flat sub-manifold $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ with dimension-dependent constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sharp orbital stability result for a class of exact steady solutions, expressed in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind, of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation in a disk. A special case of these solutions is the truncated Lamb dipole, whose stream function corresponds to the second eigenfunction of the Dirichlet Laplacian. The proof is achieved by establishing a suitable variational characterization for these solutions via conserved quantities of the Euler equation and employing a compactness argument.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we show the existence of a solution operator to the $\bar\partial-$equation in the polydisc that preserves H\"older regularity. This solution operator is constructed using Henkin's formula. It is a well-known fact that solution operators to the $\bar\partial-$equation on product domains do not improve H\"older regularity. Hence, this solution operator is optimal in that regard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the evolution of tokens within a deep stack of Transformer layers as a continuous-time flow on the unit sphere, governed by a mean-field interacting particle system, building on the framework introduced in (Geshkovski et al., 2023). Studying the corresponding mean-field Partial Differential Equation (PDE), which can be interpreted as a Wasserstein gradient flow, in this paper we provide a mathematical investigation of the long-term behavior of this system, with a particular focus on the emergence and persistence of meta-stable phases and clustering phenomena, key elements in applications like next-token prediction. More specifically, we perform a perturbative analysis of the mean-field PDE around the iid uniform initialization and prove that, in the limit of large number of tokens, the model remains close to a meta-stable manifold of solutions with a given structure (e.g., periodicity). Further, the structure characterizing the meta-stable manifold is explicitly identified, as a function of the inverse temperature parameter of the model, by the index maximizing a certain rescaling of Gegenbauer polynomials.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Nino Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Allard's Interior $\varepsilon$-Regularity Theorem for $m$-dimensional varifolds with generalized mean curvature in $L^p_{loc}$, for $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $p&gt;m$, in Alexandrov spaces of dimension $n$ with double-sided bounded intrinsic sectional curvature. We first give an intrinsic proof of this theorem in the case of varifolds in Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$ whose metric tensor is at least of class $\mathcal{C}^2$, without using Nash's Isometric Embedding Theorem. This approach provides explicitly computable constants that depend only on $n$, $m$, the injectivity radius and bounds on the sectional curvature, which is essential for proving our main theorem, as we establish it through a density argument in the topological space of Riemannian manifolds with positive lower bounds on the injectivity radius and double-sided bounds on sectional curvature, equipped with the $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ topology, for every $\alpha \in ]0,1[$ (in fact, it is enough with the $W^{2,q}$ topology for some suitable $q$ large enough).</description>
