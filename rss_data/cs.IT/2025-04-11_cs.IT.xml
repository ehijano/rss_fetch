      <title>Task-oriented Age of Information for Remote Inference with Hybrid Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence (AI) through their advanced reasoning capabilities, but their extensive parameter sets introduce significant inference latency, posing a challenge to ensure the timeliness of inference results. While Small Language Models (SLMs) offer faster inference speeds with fewer parameters, they often compromise accuracy on complex tasks. This study proposes a novel remote inference system comprising a user, a sensor, and an edge server that integrates both model types alongside a decision maker. The system dynamically determines the resolution of images transmitted by the sensor and routes inference tasks to either an SLM or LLM to optimize performance. The key objective is to minimize the Task-oriented Age of Information (TAoI) by jointly considering the accuracy and timeliness of the inference task. Due to the non-uniform transmission time and inference time, we formulate this problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). By converting the SMDP to an equivalent Markov decision process, we prove that the optimal control policy follows a threshold-based structure. We further develop a relative policy iteration algorithm leveraging this threshold property. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed optimal policy significantly outperforms baseline approaches in managing the accuracy-timeliness trade-off.</description>

      <title>Enabling Gigantic MIMO Beamforming with Analog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we have introduced a microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) as an analog computer that processes microwave signals linearly, demonstrating its potential to reduce the computational complexity of specific signal processing tasks. In this paper, we extend these benefits to wireless communications, showcasing how MiLAC enables gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming entirely in the analog domain. MiLAC-aided beamforming can implement regularized zero-forcing beamforming (R-ZFBF) at the transmitter and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection at the receiver, while significantly reducing hardware costs by minimizing the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and only relying on low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In addition, it eliminates per-symbol operations by completely avoiding digital-domain processing and remarkably reduces the computational complexity of R-ZFBF, which scales quadratically with the number of antennas instead of cubically. Numerical results show that it can perform R-ZFBF with a computational complexity reduction of up to 7400 times compared to digital beamforming.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient UAV Replacement in Software-Defined UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in networked environments face significant challenges due to energy constraints and limited battery life, which necessitate periodic replacements to maintain continuous operation. Efficiently managing the handover of data flows during these replacements is crucial to avoid disruptions in communication and to optimize energy consumption. This paper addresses the complex issue of energy-efficient UAV replacement in software-defined UAV network. We introduce a novel approach based on establishing a strict total ordering relation for UAVs and data flows, allowing us to formulate the problem as an integer linear program. By utilizing the Gurobi solver, we obtain optimal handover schedules for the tested problem instances. Additionally, we propose a heuristic algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining near-optimal performance. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that our heuristic offers practical and scalable solution, ensuring energy-efficient UAV replacement while minimizing network disruptions. Our results suggest that the proposed approach can enhance UAV battery life and improve overall network reliability in real-world applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we derive an expression for the achievable rate in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) when the channels to and from the BD-RIS are line-of-sight (LoS) while the direct link is non-line-of-sight (NLoS). The rate expression allows to derive the optimal unitary and symmetric scattering BD-RIS matrix in closed form. Our simulation results show that the proposed solution is competitive even under the more usual Ricean channel fading model when the direct link is weak.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Beamforming for Enforcing Semantic Secrecy in 5G NR mmWave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the performance of semantically-secure physical layer security (PLS) in 5G new radio (NR) mmWave communications during the initial cell search procedure in the NR band n257 at 27 GHz. A gNB transmits PLS-encoded messages in the presence of an eavesdropper, who intercepts the communication by non-intrusively collecting channel readings in the form of IQ samples. For the message transmission, we use the physical broadcast channel (PBCH) within the synchronization signal block. We analyze different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions by progressively reducing the transmit power of the subcarriers carrying the PBCH channel, while ensuring optimal conditions for over-the-air frequency and timing synchronization. We measure the secrecy performance of the communication in terms of upper and lower bounds for the distinguishing error rate (DER) metric for different SNR levels and beam angles when performing beamsteering in indoor scenarios, such as office environments and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) design for pinching antenna systems (PASS) is proposed, where the pinching antennas are deployed for establishing reliable line-of-sight communication and sensing links. More particularly, a separated ISAC design is proposed for the two-waveguide PASS, where one waveguide is used to emit the joint communication and sensing signals while the other waveguide is used to receive the reflected echo signals. Based on this framework, a penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the illumination power as well as ensure the communication quality-of-service requirement. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed PASS-ISAC scheme outperforms the other baseline schemes, and 2) the considered equal power allocation model achieves a performance comparable to the optimal power allocation.</description>

      <title>Finite-Blocklength Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional asymptotic information-theoretic studies of the fundamental limits of wireless communication systems primarily rely on some ideal assumptions, such as infinite blocklength and vanishing error probability. While these assumptions enable tractable mathematical characterizations, they fail to capture the stringent requirements of some emerging next-generation wireless applications, such as ultra-reliable low latency communication and ultra-massive machine type communication, in which it is required to support a much wider range of features including short-packet communication, extremely low latency, and/or low energy consumption. To better support such applications, it is important to consider finite-blocklength information theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the advances in this field, followed by a discussion on the open questions. Specifically, we commence with the fundamental limits of source coding in the non-asymptotic regime, with a particular focus on lossless and lossy compression in point-to-point~(P2P) and multiterminal cases. Next, we discuss the fundamental limits of channel coding in P2P channels, multiple access channels, and emerging massive access channels. We further introduce recent advances in joint source and channel coding, highlighting its considerable performance advantage over separate source and channel coding in the non-asymptotic regime. In each part, we review various non-asymptotic achievability bounds, converse bounds, and approximations, as well as key ideas behind them, which are essential for providing engineering insights into the design of future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Function-Correcting Codes for $\rho$-locally $\lambda$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore $\rho$-locally $\lambda$-functions and develop function-correcting codes for these functions. We propose an upper bound on the redundancy of these codes, based on the minimum possible length of an error-correcting code with a given number of codewords and minimum distance. Additionally, we provide a sufficient optimality condition for the function-correcting codes when $\lambda = 4$. We also demonstrate that any function can be represented as a $\rho$-locally $\lambda$-function, illustrating this with a representation of Hamming weight distribution functions. Furthermore, we present another construction of function-correcting codes for Hamming weight distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Introducing Repository Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing from engineering systems and control theory, we introduce a framework to understand repository stability, which is a repository activity capacity to return to equilibrium following disturbances - such as a sudden influx of bug reports, key contributor departures, or a spike in feature requests. The framework quantifies stability through four indicators: commit patterns, issue resolution, pull request processing, and community engagement, measuring development consistency, problem-solving efficiency, integration effectiveness, and sustainable participation, respectively. These indicators are synthesized into a Composite Stability Index (CSI) that provides a normalized measure of repository health proxied by its stability. Finally, the framework introduces several important theoretical properties that validate its usefulness as a measure of repository health and stability. At a conceptual phase and open to debate, our work establishes mathematical criteria for evaluating repository stability and proposes new ways to understand sustainable development practices. The framework bridges control theory concepts with modern collaborative software development, providing a foundation for future empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Bregman-Hausdorff divergence: strengthening the connections between computational geometry and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. On a technical side, we propose an extension of the Hausdorff distance from metric spaces to spaces equipped with asymmetric distance measures. Specifically, we focus on the family of Bregman divergences, which includes the popular Kullback--Leibler divergence (also known as relative entropy).
  As a proof of concept, we use the resulting Bregman--Hausdorff divergence to compare two collections of probabilistic predictions produced by different machine learning models trained using the relative entropy loss. The algorithms we propose are surprisingly efficient even for large inputs with hundreds of dimensions.
  In addition to the introduction of this technical concept, we provide a survey. It outlines the basics of Bregman geometry, as well as computational geometry algorithms. We focus on algorithms that are compatible with this geometry and are relevant for machine learning.</description>

      <title>Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Computing, and Semantic Communication with Fluid Antenna for Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for the Metaverse but faces challenges like high data volume and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a novel integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework, which uses semantic communication to transmit only contextual information, reducing data overhead and enhancing efficiency. To address the sensitivity of semantic communication to channel conditions, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced, enabling dynamic adaptability. The FA-enabled ISCSC framework considers multiple users and extended targets composed of a series of scatterers, formulating a joint optimization problem to maximize the data rate while ensuring sensing accuracy and meeting computational and power constraints. An alternating optimization (AO) method decomposes the problem into subproblems for ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction. Simulations confirm the framework's effectiveness in improving data rates and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Spectrum Sharing for Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Networks with Large-Scale CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.03979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellites and terrestrial cellular networks can be integrated together for extended broadband coverage in e.g., maritime communication scenarios. The co-channel interference (CCI) is a challenging issue for spectrum sharing between satellites and terrestrial networks. Different from previous studies that adopt full channel state information (CSI) or CSI with Gaussian estimation errors for CCI mitigation, we consider a more practical case with only slowly-varying large-scale CSI to facilitate overhead reduction. A joint power and channel allocation scheme is proposed for the terrestrial system, under the constraint of leakage interference to satellite mobile terminals (MTs). The proposed scheme provides near-optimal performance according to both theoretical analysis and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Physical Layer Security: From Far-Field to Near-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The secrecy performance in both near-field and far-field communications is analyzed using two fundamental metrics: the secrecy capacity under a power constraint and the minimum power requirement to achieve a specified secrecy rate target. 1) For the secrecy capacity, a closed-form expression is derived under a discrete-time memoryless setup. This expression is further analyzed under several far-field and near-field channel models, and the capacity scaling law is revealed by assuming an infinitely large transmit array and an infinitely high power. A novel concept of "depth of insecurity" is proposed to evaluate the secrecy performance achieved by near-field beamfocusing. It is demonstrated that increasing the number of transmit antennas reduces this depth and thus improves the secrecy performance. 2) Regarding the minimum required power, a closed-form expression is derived and analyzed within far-field and near-field scenarios. Asymptotic analyses are performed by setting the number of transmit antennas to infinity to unveil the power scaling law. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: i) compared to far-field communications, near-field communications expand the areas where secure transmission is feasible, specifically when the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the intended receiver; ii) as the number of transmit antennas increases, neither the secrecy capacity nor the minimum required power scales or vanishes unboundedly, adhering to the principle of energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Policies in a Multi-Source Status Update System with Dedicated and Shared Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Use of multi-path network topologies has become a prominent technique to assert timeliness in terms of age of information (AoI) and to improve resilience to link disruptions in communication systems. However, establishing multiple dedicated communication links among network nodes is a costly endeavor. Therefore, quite often, these secondary communication links are shared among multiple entities. Moreover, these multi-path networks come with the added challenge of out-of-order transmissions. In this paper, we study an amalgamation of the above two aspects, i.e., multi-path transmissions and link sharing. In contrast to the existing literature where the main focus has been scheduling multiple sources on a single shared server, we delve into the realm where each source sharing the shared server is also supplemented with its dedicated server so as to improve its timeliness. In this multi-path link sharing setting with generate-at-will transmissions, we first present the optimal probabilistic scheduler, and then propose several heuristic-based cyclic scheduling algorithms for the shared server, to minimize the weighted average age of information of the sources.</description>

      <title>First Real-Time Detection of Ambient Backscatters using Uplink Sounding Reference Signals of a Commercial 4G Smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15576</link>

Abstract: Recently, cellular Ambient Backscattering has been proposed for cellular networks. Up to now an Ambient backscatter device, called zero-energy device or tag, broadcasted its message by backscattering ambient downlink waves from the closest Base Station (BS) according to a predefined pattern. A tag was detected by smartphones nearby. This paper presents, for the first time, a novel ambient backscatter communication system exploiting uplink ambient waves from smartphones instead of downlink waves. In this novel system, a BS connected to a smartphone monitors the uplink pilot signals and detects TAGs in proximity. The proposed system is implemented and tested with one prototype of TAG, a commercial off-the shelf 4G smartphone and a 4G Software Defined Radio (SDR) BS. Indoor and outdoor experiments were conducted to assess the proposed technique. These very preliminary experiments exhibit a promising potential. In indoor, a detection probability of more than 90% has been achieved without false alarm when the TAG was 3 meters from the UE, and the BS 20 meters away of them, behind walls and obstacles.</description>

      <title>Intersection of linear and multi-twisted codes with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a formula for constructing a generator matrix for the intersection of any pair of linear codes over a finite field. Consequently, we establish a condition under which a linear code has a trivial intersection with another linear code (or its Galois dual). Furthermore, we provide a condition for reversibility and propose a generator matrix formula for the largest reversible subcode of any linear code. We then focus on the comprehensive class of multi-twisted (MT) codes, which are naturally and more effectively represented using generator polynomial matrices (GPMs). We prove that the reversed code of an MT code remains MT and derive an explicit formula for its GPM. Additionally, we examine the intersection of a pair of MT codes, possibly with different shift constants, and demonstrate that this intersection is not necessarily MT. However, when the intersection admits an MT structure, we propose the corresponding shift constants. We also establish a GPM formula for the intersection of a pair of MT codes with the same shift constants. This result enables us to derive a GPM formula for the intersection of an MT code and the Galois dual of another MT code. Finally, we examine conditions for various properties on MT codes. Perhaps most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for an MT code to be Galois self-orthogonal, Galois dual-containing, Galois linear complementary dual (LCD), or reversible.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ill-conditioned Hankel Matrix Recovery via Structured Newton-like Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust Hankel recovery problem, which simultaneously removes the sparse outliers and fulfills missing entries from the partial observation. We propose a novel non-convex algorithm, coined Hankel Structured Newton-Like Descent (HSNLD), to tackle the robust Hankel recovery problem. HSNLD is highly efficient with linear convergence, and its convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the underlying Hankel matrix. The recovery guarantee has been established under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show the superior performance of HSNLD against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>
