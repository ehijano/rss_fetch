      <title>Deep learning-based sequential data assimilation for chaotic dynamics identifies local instabilities from single state forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ability to discover data assimilation (DA) schemes meant for chaotic dynamics with deep learning (DL). The focus is on learning the analysis step of sequential DA, from state trajectories and their observations, using a simple residual convolutional neural network, while assuming the dynamics to be known. Experiments are performed with the Lorenz 96 dynamics, which display spatiotemporal chaos and for which solid benchmarks for DA performance exist. The accuracy of the states obtained from the learned analysis approaches that of the best possibly tuned ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and is far better than that of variational DA alternatives. Critically, this can be achieved while propagating even just a single state in the forecast step. We investigate the reason for achieving ensemble filtering accuracy without an ensemble. We diagnose that the analysis scheme actually identifies key dynamical perturbations, mildly aligned with the unstable subspace, from the forecast state alone, without any ensemble-based covariances representation. This reveals that the analysis scheme has learned some multiplicative ergodic theorem associated to the DA process seen as a non-autonomous random dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Dissipative fractional standard maps: Riemann-Liouville and Caputo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, given the inherent nature of dissipation in realistic dynamical systems, we explore the effects of dissipation within the context of fractional dynamics. Specifically, we consider the dissipative versions of two well known fractional maps: the Riemann-Liouville (RL) and the Caputo (C) fractional standard maps (fSMs). Both fSMs are two-dimensional nonlinear maps with memory given in action-angle variables $(I_n,\theta_n)$; $n$ being the discrete iteration time of the maps. In the dissipative versions these fSMs are parameterized by the strength of nonlinearity $K$, the fractional order of the derivative $\alpha\in(1,2]$, and the dissipation strength $\gamma\in(0,1]$. In this work we focus on the average action $\left&lt; I_n \right&gt;$ and the average squared action $\left&lt; I_n^2 \right&gt;$ when~$K\gg1$, i.e. along strongly chaotic orbits. We first demonstrate, for $|I_0|&gt;K$, that dissipation produces the exponential decay of the average action $\left&lt; I_n \right&gt; \approx I_0\exp(-\gamma n)$ in both dissipative fSMs. Then, we show that while $\left&lt; I_n^2 \right&gt;_{RL-fSM}$ barely depends on $\alpha$ (effects are visible only when $\alpha\to 1$), any $\alpha&lt; 2$ strongly influences the behavior of $\left&lt; I_n^2 \right&gt;_{C-fSM}$. We also derive an analytical expression able to describe $\left&lt; I_n^2 \right&gt;_{RL-fSM}(K,\alpha,\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>The two-dimensional border-collision normal form with a zero determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The border-collision normal form is a piecewise-linear family of continuous maps that describe the dynamics near border-collision bifurcations. Most prior studies assume each piece of the normal form is invertible, as is generic from an abstract viewpoint, but in applied problems one piece of the map often has degenerate range, corresponding to a zero determinant. This provides simplification, yet even in two dimensions the dynamics can be incredibly rich. The purpose of this paper is to determine broadly how the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form with a zero determinant differs for different values of its parameters. We identify parameter regions of period-adding, period-incrementing, mode-locking, and component doubling of chaotic attractors, and characterise the dominant bifurcation boundaries. The intention is for the results to enable border-collision bifurcations in mathematical models to be analysed more easily and effectively, and we illustrate this with a flu epidemic model and two stick-slip friction oscillator models. We also describe three novel bifurcation structures that remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>Chaotic fields behave universally out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamics is always characterized by swarms of unstable trajectories, unpredictable individually, and thus generally studied statistically. It is often the case that such phase-space densities relax exponentially fast to a limiting distribution, that rules the long-time average of every observable of interest. Before that asymptotic timescale, the statistics of chaos is generally believed to depend on both the initial conditions and the chosen observable. I show that this is not the case for a widely applicable class of models, that feature a phase-space (`field') distribution common to all pushed-forward or integrated observables, while the system is still relaxing towards statistical equilibrium or a steady state. This universal profile is determined by both leading and first subleading eigenfunctions of the transport operator (Koopman or Perron-Frobenius) that maps phase-space densities forward or backward in time.</description>

      <title>Bound states in the continuum induced via local symmetries in complex structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) defy conventional wisdom that assumes a spectral separation between propagating waves, that carry energy away, and spatially localized waves corresponding to discrete frequencies. They can be described as resonance states with infinite lifetime, i.e., leaky modes with zero leakage. The advent of metamaterials and nanophotonics allowed the creation of BICs in a variety of systems. Mainly, BICs have been realized by destructive interference between outgoing resonant modes or exploiting engineered global symmetries that enforce the decoupling of a symmetry-incompatible bound mode from the surrounding radiation modes. Here, we introduce theoretically BICs relying on a different mechanism, namely local symmetries that enforce a field concentration on a part of a complex system without implying any global symmetry. We experimentally implement such BICs using microwaves in a compact one-dimensional photonic network and show that they emerge from the annihilation of two topological singularities, a zero and a pole, of the measured scattering matrix. Our alternative for achieving BICs in complex wave systems may be useful for applications like sensing, lasing, and enhancement of nonlinear interactions that require high-$Q$ modes.</description>
