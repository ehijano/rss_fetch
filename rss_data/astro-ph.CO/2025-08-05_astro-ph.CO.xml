      <title>Viability of generalized $\alpha$-inflation from Planck, ACT, and DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two classes of single-field inflationary models - a generalization of the alpha-attractor and the alpha-Starobinsky model - and examine their compatibility with current observational data from Planck, ACT DR6, and BAO measurements from DESI DR2. Our analysis focuses on the reheating phase that follows inflation, characterized by the equation-of-state parameter omega_re, the reheating temperature T_re, and the number of e-folds N_re. We use a semi-analytical approach based on an equation linking inflationary dynamics to reheating, allowing us to compute the inflaton value at horizon crossing phi_k and other related cosmological quantities. We consider different decay channels for the inflaton: gravitational, Yukawa, and scalar. We are particularly interested in studying these models in the r-n_s and T_re-n_s planes, especially in regions close to the P-ACT-LB2 combination, which is the area most distant from the Planck data. To do this, we explore a wide range of values for the model parameters and show the graphs where the closest approximation to the P-ACT-LB2 region occurs. Other authors have already carried out related work; where there is overlap, our results are consistent with those obtained by other means.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on $f(T,B)$ Gravity from Observations of Early and Late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified framework comprising two complementary approaches to constrain three functional forms of $f(T,B)$ gravity, namely the linear, quadratic, and general power law models, by jointly utilizing early and late Universe observations. First, we impose bounds on deviations in the weak interaction freeze-out temperature, informed by the latest measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we incorporate direct Hubble parameter data, $H(\mathcal{z})$, obtained from Cosmic Chronometers in the redshift range $0.07\le\mathcal{z}\le2.0$, to trace the expansion history of the Universe. By minimizing a combined chi-square statistic across both datasets, we derive the best-fit values and confidence intervals for each model parameter. The joint analysis significantly refines the parameter constraints compared to methods based solely on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, thereby offering a more robust test of $f(T,B)$ gravity across cosmic epochs. The results support the viability of torsion-based modifications to General Relativity and provide a consistent methodology for future evaluation using upcoming observational data.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe. Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model are also resolved in our model.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{GENGARS}$: Accurate non-Gaussian initial conditions with arbitrary bispectrum for N-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity is predicted by various inflationary models, and N-body simulations are a crucial tool for studying its imprints on large-scale structure. In this work, we present \texttt{GENGARS} ( GEnerator of Non-Gaussian ARbitrary Shapes), a framework for generating accurate non-Gaussian initial conditions for N-body simulations. It builds upon the formulation introduced by Wagner \&amp; Verde (2012), enabling to generate a primordial gravitational potential with a desired separable bispectrum $B_{\Phi}(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. For the local, equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussian templates, we benchmark our method against the well-established \texttt{2LPT-PNG} code. We show that \texttt{GENGARS} achieves improved accuracy and lower noise by suppressing spurious contributions to the primordial power spectrum. This paper aims at presenting the method, quantifying its performance and illustrating the benefits and applicable use cases over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Clustering of Primordial Black Holes in Excursion Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) within the framework of Excursion Set Theory (EST). The EST formalism is extended to compute the joint probability of forming PBH pairs within a clustering distance, based on two stochastic trajectories with a shared history. Our results show that an enhanced power spectrum not only increases the formation of PBHs in specific mass ranges but also enhances their clustering probability. We find a one-to-one correspondence between the blue-tilted spectral index and the mass ranges in which PBHs form and cluster. Additionally, we demonstrate that the clustering probability decreases asymptotically with increasing clustering distance, while a higher critical density threshold (barrier) leads to a suppression of clustering abundance.</description>

      <title>Wiener filtering and multi-tracer techniques for dark matter cross-correlations between gamma-ray emission and galaxy catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.</description>

      <title>New Radio Data on Sources of the Big Trio Program for Searching for Distant Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sample of objects with steep and ultra-steep spectra was prepared from radio sources of the Cold experiment surveys conducted on the RATAN-600 radio telescope. It formed the basis for the Big Trio program for searching for distant radio galaxies. With the advent of high-sensitivity, high-angular-resolution radio sky surveys, as well as deep optical and infrared surveys, it became possible to conduct additional studies of the sample. We refined the morphology and spectra of continuous radio emissions from radio galaxies.
  A detailed study of the morphological features of the sample sources revealed that 4 of the sample sources are formed by close radio sources with a distance of about 60 kpc between the parent galaxies. 8% of the radio sources demonstrate a restart of activity in the radio range, 20% of the sources are in an environment that leads to the deformation of the lobes, 11% are young sources and 2% are fading.
  A high percentage of sources with a variability index greater than 3 is associated with a large difference in the angular resolution of the compared TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as an underestimated flux density for some double sources in the latter survey. Comparison of spectral indices obtained from old and new data showed that in the studied sample the share of sources with steep spectra has significantly decreased. Most likely, this is due to the addition of low-frequency GLEAM data, although for some radio sources a possible evolution of the continuum spectrum over an interval of several decades is not excluded -- a shift towards low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Higher order methods for Radiative Transfer in Astrophysical simulations: $\rm P_n$ vs $\rm M_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current cosmological simulations, the radiative transfer modules generally rely on the M_1 approximation, which has some glaring flaws related to its fluid-like behaviour, such as spurious pseudo-sources and loss of directionality when radiation fronts from different directions collide. P_n, another moment-based model used in other fields of physics, may correct these issues. We aim at testing out P_n in an astrophysical setting and compare it to M_1, in order to see if it can indeed correct M_1's flaws. Also, we want to use P_n's solutions to better pinpoint M_1 errors. We implement a P_n radiation transport method and couple it to a photo-thermo-chemistry module to account for the interaction of ionising radiation with the Hydrogen gas, and benchmark it using tests for radiative transfer models comparison in astrophysics as defined in arXiv:astro-ph/0603199. We find that high order P_n (e.g. P_9) indeed correct M_1's flaws, while faring as well or even better in some aspects in the tests, in particular when directionality is important or colliding radiation fronts occur. By comparing P_9 and M_1 radiation fields in an idealised and cosmological test case, we highlight a new, thus far unreported artefact of M_1, the 'dark sombrero'. A dark sombrero appears as a spherical photon-deficit shell around the source. The photon density in dark sombreros can be underestimated by a factor up to 2-3. They occur in regions where a source's radiation field connects with that of another source or group of sources. These basic properties (position and amplitude) of the dark sombreros may depend on the sources' relative intensities, positions, spatial resolution, although we have not been able to test this in detail in this study.</description>

      <title>(Non-)Perturbative Dynamics of a Light QCD Axion: Dark Matter and the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considerable theoretical efforts have gone into expanding the reach of the QCD axion beyond its canonical mass--decay-constant relation. The $Z_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion model reduces the QCD axion mass naturally, by invoking a discrete $Z_\mathcal{N}$ symmetry through which the axion field is coupled to $\mathcal{N}$ copies of the Standard Model. Before the QCD phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm QCD}$, the $Z_\mathcal{N}$ potential has a minimum at misalignment angle $\theta=\pi$. At $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta =\pi$ becomes a maximum; the axion potential becomes exponentially suppressed and develops $\mathcal{N}$ minima -- only one of which actually solves the strong CP problem. Before $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta$ relaxes towards $\pi$. After $T_{\rm QCD}$, the axion field starts from around the hilltop and may have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the newly suppressed potential barriers. Such a field evolution leads to nonlinear effects via the self-interactions near the hilltop, which can cause the exponential growth of fluctuations and backreaction on the coherent motion. This behavior can influence the relic density of the field and the minimum in which it settles. We conduct the first lattice simulations of the $Z_{\mathcal{N}}$ QCD axion using ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice to accurately calculate dark matter abundances and find nonlinear dynamics reduce the abundance by up to a factor of two. We furthermore find that the probability of solving the strong CP problem tends to diverge considerably from the naive expectation of $1/\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent anisotropy of cosmic-ray muons: A twelve-year study with IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, energy-resolved study of cosmic-ray muon anisotropy using 12 years (2011-2023) of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, comprising 7.92 x 10^11 events in the 13 TeV to 5.3 PeV energy range. Dividing the spectrum at log-scale energy 5 GeV, we contrast low- and high-energy anisotropy features via sidereal modulation, angular profiles, Fourier analysis, and full-sky HEALPix mapping. Gaussian and power-law fits to energy distributions are evaluated using chi-squared, reduced chi-squared, and Bayesian Information Criterion. Results show strong dipolar and large-scale anisotropy at low energies, likely due to geomagnetic and atmospheric effects, while high-energy muons display weaker, more localized structures consistent with reduced scattering and source-related anisotropy. Energy distributions are well fit by Gaussians, especially in the 6.5 to 100 bin, validating IceCube's reconstruction at PeV scales. These findings confirm energy-dependent anisotropy and support cosmic-ray diffusion models.</description>

      <title>A General Model for Dark Energy Crossing the Phantom Divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of spatially covariant theories, we propose a general model for dark energy (DE) in which the cosmological background and perturbations are independently controlled by different sets of coefficients, and the equation of state of DE is directly determined by two free functions of time from the Lagrangian. These properties allow to realize arbitrary background evolutions while avoiding ghost and gradient instabilities in linear perturbations. They also enable a more direct analysis of phantom crossing without having to first solve the background equations of motion. In this model, the sound speed of the scalar mode is scale-dependent and approaches infinity at large scale, so that the field becomes non-dynamical in the infrared (IR) limit. Even though this usually indicates a strong coupling issue, we speculate that this is avoided because the scalar degree of freedom becomes frozen not only at linear order but also at any higher order in IR limit. Given this characteristic large scales behavior, we dub the model \emph{Freezing Gravity}. On smaller scales, the scalar mode propagates with a finite speed of sound. The theory has a cut-off in energy, signaled by the pole in the speed of sound, when the effective Planck mass exceeds Planck mass.</description>

      <title>Geometric multipartite entanglement from gravitational particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore novel generation of genuine multipartite entanglement within gravitational particle production processes during inflationary stages. To this end, we focus on perturbative production mechanisms, considering a non-minimally coupled scalar inflaton field with quartic self-coupling potential and computing probability amplitudes arising from its gravitational interaction with background perturbations. The corresponding entanglement amount is quantified using the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, that provides a \emph{geometric interpretation of particle entanglement, in terms of the Fubini-Study metric}. We observe that, in the limit of negligible squeezing, the total amount of entanglement is dominated by the infrared cutoff scale, in agreement with previous studies analyzing the von Neumann entropy within bipartite scenarios. We then show that \emph{non-negligible multipartite entanglement signatures may emerge across inflation, even during the latest stages of slow-roll}, highlighting their dependence on inflationary momentum scales. Generalizations to regimes with non-negligible squeezing, cubic non-Gaussianities, additional spectator fields and possible observational signatures are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Polynomial Hybrid Inflation: Planck and ACT Compatibility via Radiative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of one-loop radiative corrections in a non-supersymmetric model of hybrid inflation with a chaotic (polynomial-like) potential,$V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p$, in the light of the latest constraints from \textit{Planck} and \textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope} (ACT) observations. Here, $V_0$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, and $\lambda_p$ is a coupling associated with the polynomial term of power $p$. These corrections can naturally arise from couplings of the inflaton to other matter fields, which also facilitate the reheating process. At the tree level, the predictions of such models for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ typically lie outside the current observational bounds. However, incorporating one-loop radiative corrections modifies the potential to, \[ V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p + A \phi^4 \ln (\phi/ \mu), \] where $A$ characterizes the strength of the inflaton's coupling to other fields, and \(\mu\) is an appropriate renormalization scale. This radiatively corrected potential can reconcile the model with the combined \textit{Planck}+ACT data over a suitable range of parameter space explored in this work. In particular, radiative corrections from fermionic loops ($A &lt; 0$) suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, while simultaneously yielding a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s &lt; 1$, even for sub-Planckian field excursions. This brings the prediction in line with current observations, while still allowing for potentially detectable signatures of primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, the inflaton's couplings enable successful reheating and naturally accommodate non-thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified framework for inflation and baryogenesis.</description>

Abstract: EDGES-3 is the third iteration of the EDGES experiment, designed to measure the predicted global absorption feature in the radio spectrum produced by neutral hydrogen gas at cosmic dawn, a critical observation determining when and how the first stars populated the universe. The EDGES-3 instrument has been redesigned to include both the analog and digital electronics within the antenna, allowing for in-situ calibration and removal of the lossy balun found in EDGES-2. EDGES-3 has been on multiple deployments in the past 4 years; to Oregon, Devon Island, Adak Island, and is currently installed and taking data in the outback of Western Australia. This paper provides an accounting of the challenges inherent in the detection of the global, cosmological 21-cm signal, the strategies EDGES employs to mitigate each of these challenges, a description of the instrument, and a report on the Western Australia deployment along with observational data.</description>

      <title>Lepton parity dark matter and naturally unstable domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple and predictive setup that connects neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and gravitational waves. A minimal lepton parity DM scenario is considered where the residual symmetry $(-1)^L$ from the type I seesaw acts as the dark parity $D=(-1)^{L+2j}$, ensuring DM stability without imposing any new symmetry. A singlet Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity serves as the DM candidate, interacting via a real scalar $\sigma$ which is also even lepton parity. The scalar potential possesses an accidental $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, whose spontaneous breaking gives rise to unstable domain walls (DW) in the presence of explicit $\mathcal{Z}_2$ breaking terms allowed by the lepton parity. The subsequent DW annihilation generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background potentially observable at different GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing Dark Matter with Generative Models for Extragalactic Stellar Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming ground and space-based surveys are poised to illuminate low surface brightness tidal features, providing a new observable connection to dark matter physics. From imaging of tidal debris, the morphology of stellar streams can be used to infer the geometry of dark matter halos. In this paper, we develop a generative approach, X-Stream, which translates stream imaging into constraints on the radial density profile of dark matter halos--from the inner region out to the virial radius. Using the GPU-accelerated code streamsculptor, we generate thousands of stream realizations in trial gravitational potentials and apply nested sampling with a custom objective function to explore viable regions of parameter space. We find that multiple stellar streams can be used to constrain the entire radial density profile of a halo, including both its inner and outer density slopes. These constraints provide a test for alternatives to cold dark matter, such as self-interacting dark matter, which predicts cored density profiles. From cosmological simulations, the outer density slope is expected to correlate with merger histories though remains underexplored observationally. With ongoing and upcoming missions such as Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, ARRAKIHS, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, X-Stream will enable detailed mapping of dark matter for thousands of galaxies across a wide range of redshifts and halo masses.</description>

      <title>Redshift Evolution of the HII Galaxy $L$-$\sigma$ Relation: Gaussian Process Analysis and Cosmological Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utility of HII starburst galaxies (HIIGs) as cosmic standard candles relies on the empirical $L$-$\sigma$ relation between the H$\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and ionized gas velocity dispersion ($\sigma$). However, the classic scaling $L$-$\sigma$ relation well-calibrated with the low-redshift HIIGs fails to properly describe their high-redshift counterparts. To address this, we try to explore new parameterization of the $L$-$\sigma$ relation, which is expected to be valid across all redshifts. Using Gaussian process reconstruction of the Hubble diagram from the Pantheon+ supernovae Ia sample, we compare three modified versions of the $L$-$\sigma$ relation against the classic scaling form through Bayesian evidence analysis. Our results identify the logarithmic redshift-dependent correction as the most statistically favored parameterization. This conclusion remains valid when repeating the analysis in the $\Lambda$CDM model with cosmological parameters fixed to their Planck 2018 fiducial values, which demonstrates the robustness of our results across different cosmological distance estimation approaches. After accounting for Malmquist bias effects, we still detect redshift evolution in the $L-\sigma$ relation, albeit with reduced statistical significance. Furthermore, we perform cosmological analysis within the $\Lambda$CDM model from a joint sample of HIIGs and giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHRs), and yield constraints on $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ that are approximately one order of magnitude less precise than Planck 2018 results.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Temperature and E-mode Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background from the Full 500-square-degree SPTpol Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the full four-year SPTpol 500 deg$^2$ dataset in both the 95 GHz and 150 GHz frequency bands, we present measurements of the temperature and $E$-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as well as the $E$-mode polarization auto-power spectrum ($EE$) and temperature-$E$-mode cross-power spectrum ($TE$) in the angular multipole range $50&lt;\ell&lt;8000$. We find the SPTpol dataset to be self-consistent, passing several internal consistency tests based on maps, frequency bands, bandpowers, and cosmological parameters. The full SPTpol dataset is well-fit by the $\Lambda CDM$ model, for which we find $H_0=70.48\pm2.16$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_m=0.271\pm0.026$, when using only the SPTpol data and a Planck-based prior on the optical depth to reionization. The $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints are consistent across the 95 GHz-only, 150 GHz-only, $TE$-only, and $EE$-only data splits. Between the $\ell&lt;1000$ and $\ell&gt;1000$ data splits, the $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints are borderline consistent at the $\sim2\sigma$ level. This consistency improves when including a parameter $A_L$, the degree of lensing of the CMB inferred from the smearing of acoustic peaks. When marginalized over $A_L$, the $\Lambda CDM$ parameter constraints from SPTpol are consistent with those from Planck. The power spectra presented here are the most sensitive measurements of the lensed CMB damping tail to date for roughly $\ell &gt; 1700$ in $TE$ and $\ell &gt; 2000$ in $EE$.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axially Symmetric Bianchi Type I Model with Self-Consistent Recombination History and Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological measurements suggest the possibility of an anisotropic universe. As a result, the Bianchi Type I model, being the simplest anisotropic extension to the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric has been extensively studied. In this work, we show how the recombination history should be modified in an anisotropic universe and derive observables by considering the null geodesic. We then constrain the axially symmetric Bianchi Type I model by performing Markov Chain Monte Carlo with the acoustic scales in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, together with local measurements of $H(z)$ and Pantheon Supernova data. Our results reveal that the anisotropic model is not worth a bare mention compared to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, and we obtain a tight constraint on the anisotropy that generally agrees with previous studies under a maximum temperature anisotropy fraction of $2\times 10^{-5}$. To allow for a non-kinematic CMB dipole, we also present constraints based on a relaxed maximum temperature anisotropy comparable to that of the CMB dipole. We stress that there is a significant difference between the geodesic-based observables and the naive isotropic analogies when there is a noticeable anisotropy. However, the changes in recombination history are insignificant even under the relaxed anisotropy limit.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Implies a Coupled Dark Sector: Insights from DESI DR2 via a Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) have revealed compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy, challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we adopt a data-driven, model-independent approach to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and its potential interaction with dark matter using combined background cosmological datasets, including DESI DR2, cosmic chronometers, observational Hubble data, and Type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Process regression and a non-parametric formalism, we first confirm a $\sim 2\sigma$ indication of dynamical dark energy, featuring a phantom crossing around redshift $z \sim 0.4$, consistent with DESI results. We then explore the implications of dynamical EoS from DESI DR2 for dark sector coupling. Incorporating priors on the EoS from DESI DR2, we find a $\sim 2\sigma$ signal for non-zero interactions between dark energy and dark matter at low redshift. Our results suggest that if DESI's evidence for time-varying dark energy is confirmed, a coupled dark sector may be a necessary extension beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>

Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for sufficiently large $\kappa$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the [CII] luminosity function from the power spectrum of line-intensity maps at redshift 3.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forthcoming measurements of the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum (PS) are expected to provide valuable constraints on astrophysical and cosmological quantities. We focus on the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at high redshift, which remains poorly constrained, especially at the faint end. We present forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) that is to be conducted with the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) at $z\simeq3.6$. We also make predictions for surveys with a ten times larger sky coverage and/or a $\sqrt{10}$ times higher sensitivity, accounting for the Lorentzian spectral profile of Fabry-P\'erot interferometers and the impact of their resolving power $R$. Motivated by the halo-occupation properties of [CII] emitters in the MARIGOLD simulations, we derived a luminosity-mass relation by abundance matching two ALPINE LFs to the halo mass function. This relation was then used in a halo-model framework to predict the PS and its uncertainty. Bayesian inference on mock PS data provided forecasts for the first two LF moments and Schechter parameters. Depending on the true LF, the DSS is expected to be able to detect clustering and shot-noise components with signal-to-noise ratios of $\gtrsim2$. At $R=100$, spectral smoothing masks redshift-space distortions, rendering the damping scale $\sigma$ unmeasurable. For $R\gtrsim500$, $\sigma$ is distinguishable from instrumental effects, though degeneracies with amplitude parameters increase. Joint fits to the PS and LF yield precise constraints on the Schechter normalisation and cutoff luminosity, while the faint-end slope remains uncertain (unless the true value approaches $-2$). An increased survey sensitivity offers greater gains than a wider area. A higher spectral resolution improves the access to physical parameters, but intensifies degeneracies. This highlights key design trade-offs in LIM surveys.</description>

      <title>Damping Wing-Like Features in the Spectra of High Redshift Quasars: a Challenge for Fully-Coupled Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several observational detections of damping-wing-like features at the edges of ``dark gaps" in the spectra of distant quasars (the ``Malloy-Lidz effect") have been reported, rendering strong support for the existence of ``neutral islands" in the universe at redshifts as low as $z&lt;5.5$. We apply the procedure from one of these works, Zhu et al (2024), to the outputs of fully coupled cosmological simulations from two recent large projects, ``Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and ``Thesan". Synthetic spectra in both simulations have statistics of dark gaps similar to observations, but do not exhibit the damping wing features. Moreover, a toy model with neutral islands added ``by hand" only reproduces the observational results when the fraction of neutral islands among all dark gaps approaches 90%. I.e., simulations and observations appear to produce two distinct ``populations" of dark gaps. In addition, in the simulations, the neutral islands at $z=5.9$ should be short-lived and should not extend to $z&lt;5.5$. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that both simulations underestimate the fluctuations in the photoionization rate and, hence, miss a population of long-lived neutral islands, located in the large downward fluctuations of the photoionization rate.</description>

      <title>Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pop III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts that a substantial fraction of the early universe was ionized by supermassive stars at redshifts $z\sim20-30$, an era we refer to as ``The Flash''. This is followed by recombination to a mainly neutral state within a few tens of Myr. Here we discuss the implication of this ionization for the scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), $\tau$. We find a fiducial contribution of $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.04$. Combining this with the contribution to reionization by standard galaxy populations at $z\lesssim 10$ with $\tau_{\rm gal}\simeq0.06$, yields a total of $\tau\simeq0.10$. As noted recently by several authors, such a value may help resolve apparent ``problems'' faced by $\Lambda$CDM of discrepant CMB-based measures of the Hubble constant (``Hubble tension''), as well as negative neutrino masses and dynamical dark energy that have been implied by recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In addition, free-free emission from The Flash boosts the cosmic radio background, which could help explain the large 21-cm absorption depth reported by the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES).</description>

      <title>Luminosity Function of Galaxies in Voids: A Modification Inspired by Excursion Set Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard picture of cosmology, the galaxies reside in dark matter (DM) halos. DM halos are distributed in the cosmic web in different environments. The luminosity of the galaxies in different environments can be used as a probe to assess a cosmological model. This study focuses on the properties of galaxies in void regions, where halos typically do not experience extreme conditions. By examining the galaxy luminosity function, we aim to understand the dependence of galaxy properties on their environment and redshift so that later, we can use this as a tool to evaluate cosmological models. We employ the excursion set theory to incorporate parameters related to the number density of DM halos into the luminosity function. Using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and 2dFGRS datasets, we fit our theoretical models to observational data, examining the environmental and redshift dependence of the galaxy luminosity function. Our results indicate that we model the galaxy luminosity function in voids effectively by considering the linear density contrast of the environment and the growth function $D(z)$ for redshift dependence. This study provides a model for the environmental dependence of galaxy luminosity function that offers an improvement in the $\chi ^2$ parameter compared to the previously proposed model in \cite{mcnaught2014galaxy}. Both Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) tests support the superiority of this model for the void region.</description>

      <title>How Early Could the Milky Way's Disk Form?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate early, $z &gt; 3$, galaxy formation in a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a close, early-forming Milky Way (MW) analog extracted from TNG50 simulation and resimulated with detailed modeling of cold interstellar medium (ISM) formation, coupled with on-the-fly UV radiative transfer, turbulence-regulated star formation, and stellar feedback. In our enhanced-physics simulation, the galaxy develops a bistable ISM structure (warm, with $T \sim 10^4$ K, and cold, with $T &lt; 100$ K) and exhibits significantly more efficient, early, and bursty star formation than in TNG. Notably, the stellar disk of this MW progenitor forms extremely early, around $z\sim6-7$, and exhibits chemo-kinematic properties consistent with the low-metallicity population of the MW stars. The disk forms rapidly, on a timescale of $\sim$0.2 Gyr which is significantly shorter than the timescale implied by the observable chemo-kinematic signatures of disk spinup, $\sim$0.7 Gyr, due to the scatter in the age--metallicity relation. The rotational support of the gas disk and the location of the galaxy on the main sequence are consistent with early disk galaxies observed by JWST and ALMA at $z\sim4-7$, suggesting that some of these galaxies could be progenitors of MW-like systems. Remarkably, the variation of the global star formation rate (SFR) before disk formation is similar to the observed SFR scatter at these early times. Our findings underscore the critical role of modeling a turbulent cold ISM and turbulence-regulated star formation and feedback in driving early SFR variability, while at the same time enabling early disk formation, without destroying it with overly efficient stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>From UV-bright Galaxies to Early Disks: the Importance of Turbulent Star Formation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bursty star formation at early times can explain the surprising abundance of early UV-bright galaxies revealed by JWST but can also be a reason for the delayed formation of galactic disks in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We investigate this interplay in a cosmological simulation of an early-forming Milky Way analog with detailed modeling of the cold turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), star formation, and feedback. We find that the modeling of locally variable star formation efficiency (SFE) coupled with the ISM turbulence on the scales of star-forming regions is important for producing both early bursty evolution and early formation and survival of galactic disks. Such a model introduces a qualitatively new channel of the global star formation rate (SFR) burstiness caused by chaotic fluctuations in the average SFE due to changes in the ISM turbulence, which, in our simulation, dominates the short-term SFR variability. The average SFE stays low, close to $\sim 1\%$ per freefall time, and its variation decreases when the gas disk forms, leading to only mild effects of stellar feedback on the early disk, enabling its survival. By rerunning our simulation with fixed SFE values, we explicitly show that low SFEs lead to smoother SFR histories and disk survival, while high SFEs lead to bursty SFRs and hinder disk formation. The model with variable SFE switches between these two regimes at the moment of disk formation. These trends are missing in more commonly used star formation prescriptions with fixed SFE; in particular, the prescriptions tying star formation to molecular gas should be interpreted with caution because the two are decoupled at early times, as we also show in this paper.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Local Stellar Radiation on Dwarf Galaxy Formation Around Milky Way Analogues Across Cosmic Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the effect of local stellar radiation on the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies around Milky Way (MW) analogues. Using five simulations from the Auriga project, both with and without local stellar radiation, we find that local stellar radiation, as a pre-reionization source, is highly effective at photoionizing and heating the gas around the proto-MW analogues. As a result, the formation of surrounding dwarf galaxies in dark matter halos with masses below approximately $10^{9.5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are significantly suppressed. After reionization, the intensity of local stellar radiation eventually becomes comparable to the ultraviolet background (UVB). Consequently, the impact of local stellar radiation on the surrounding dwarf galaxy formation decreases with decreasing redshift and nearly vanishes after redshift $z=4$. At present day, the bright satellite population in the simulations with and without local stellar radiation is nearly identical. While our simulations do not have sufficient resolution to resolve the faintest satellite galaxies which are most prone to the local stellar radiation, we use the accreted galaxy mass function to assess the impact and find that the reduction in the faintest satellite is around $13$ percent in the presence of local stellar radiation, but this difference is within $\sim2\sigma$ of the Poisson uncertainty and thus not statistically significant.</description>

      <title>The Massive Flat Space Limit of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying useful flat-space limits for cosmological correlators, where they can be expressed in terms of observables in Minkowski space is nontrivial due to their scale-invariant nature. In recent years, it has been shown that momentum-space correlators encode flat-space amplitudes at specific singularities that emerge in the complex plane of their kinematics after analytical continuation. This flat-space limit is massless in the sense that the amplitude corresponds to the ultraviolet regime of the associated flat-space process, where the masses of the internal propagators are effectively zero. In this paper, we introduce a novel massive flat-space (MFS) limit, in which the internal masses in the corresponding flat-space Feynman graph remain finite. Our proposal applies to arbitrary graphs with light external legs and heavy internal lines, using a double-scaling limit. In this limit, the external energies, treated as independent variables, approach zero in inverse proportion to the propagator masses, which are sent to infinity. We present a general reduction formula that expresses diagrams in this limit in terms of amputated Feynman graphs in flat space. Our findings underscore the deep connections between the rich structure of massive Feynman integrals and the properties of cosmological correlators involving the exchange of heavy fields. Using this reduction formula, we compute sample one-loop contributions from heavy particles to inflationary correlators in the small sound-speed regime, revealing novel bispectrum shapes. The non-Gaussian signals we uncover, which are especially pronounced around the equilateral configuration, cannot be reproduced by adding local terms to the effective field theory of single-field inflation. Instead, they are captured by incorporating prescribed spatially non-local operators into the EFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the minimal gauged B-L extension of the Standard Model, we demonstrate that PeV-scale dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) can be simultaneously explained through the three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) present in the theory. The DM candidate undergoes decay into light neutrinos, providing an explanation for the observed IceCube events, while the other two RHNs generate the BAU via leptogenesis. The breaking of gauge symmetry gives rise to detectable gravitational waves (GWs) from decaying cosmic strings (CS), making this framework testable at several future GW detectors-despite being beyond the reach of conventional collider experiments due to the extremely weak coupling. The symmetry-breaking scale establishes a connection between particle masses, couplings, and the GW spectrum, offering a unified and predictive scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although previous results have ruled out the possibility of a static horizon in cosmology, we present black hole and white hole metrics that retain static horizons while reproducing cosmological behavior at large distances. Using an appropriate coordinate choice, we demonstrate that a static horizon can exist in a cosmological setting without introducing curvature invariant singularities at the horizon. The resulting metric reduces to the Schwarzschild de Sitter solution when the Hubble parameter is constant. We find that white hole metrics in an expanding universe (or black holes in a contracting universe) are significantly easier to construct, as a black hole in an expanding cosmology requires the velocity function to change sign. Consequently, this work primarily examines white holes in expanding cosmologies as a foundation for subsequent analysis of black holes in expanding universes. In later sections, we investigate scenarios involving a white hole coupled with cosmological matter, as well as a white hole with both matter and a cosmological constant. Assuming the pressure component takes its cosmological value, we show that the physical radius of the apparent horizon can asymptotically approach a constant value at late times. This metric avoids pathologies such as a singular horizon in the limit of a vanishing Hubble parameter. Finally, we analyze the realistic case of a black hole embedded in pressureless cosmological matter with and without a cosmological constant and explore its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for realizing slow-roll inflation that is fully consistent with observational data, based on conformal transformations acting exclusively on a complex scalar field -- without coupling to the gravitational sector. These transformations generically produce a plateau in the inflaton potential, as guaranteed by the maximum modulus theorem, thereby naturally satisfying the slow-roll conditions.
  Our framework utilizes squeezing operations generated by the Virasoro algebra without central extension, as developed in our earlier work. The resulting inflationary potentials depend on the Virasoro mode $n$, the power $m$ of the original potential, and the squeezing parameter $\theta$.
  We present approximate analytical expressions at leading order for the special case $n=-2$, and perform numerical analyses for both $n=-2$ and other values of $n$. These reveal parameter regimes in which the predicted cosmological observables $(n_{s},r)$ align remarkably well with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): A Census of Star Formation and Cold Gas Properties in Massive protoclusters at 1.5&lt;z&lt;4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field at z&gt;2. We further show that, instead of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end. Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_\star$&gt;8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass assembly in forming cluster cores.</description>

Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be generated in the early Universe through mechanisms such as misalignment production, thermal processes, and the decay of topological defects. In this paper, we show that scalar perturbations in the early universe could produce a significant amount of these particles primarily through mass parametric resonance effects. Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g. during the QCD phase transition. These temperature fluctuations modulate the particle mass, transferring energy into the field through parametric mass resonance, a nonlinear process. This mechanism exhibits substantially unstable regions that could lead to explosive particle productions. Notably, it does not generate additional isocurvature perturbations.</description>
