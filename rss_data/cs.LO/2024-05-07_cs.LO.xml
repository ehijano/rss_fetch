      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics I: Presheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of modal logic has witnessed tremendous development following the introduction of Kripke semantics. However, recent developments in programming languages and type theory have led to a second way of studying modalities, namely through their categorical semantics. We show how the two correspond.</description>

      <title>Certified Policy Verification and Synthesis for MDPs under Distributional Reach-avoidance Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a classical model for decision making in the presence of uncertainty. Often they are viewed as state transformers with planning objectives defined with respect to paths over MDP states. An increasingly popular alternative is to view them as distribution transformers, giving rise to a sequence of probability distributions over MDP states. For instance, reachability and safety properties in modeling robot swarms or chemical reaction networks are naturally defined in terms of probability distributions over states. Verifying such distributional properties is known to be hard and often beyond the reach of classical state-based verification techniques.
  In this work, we consider the problems of certified policy (i.e. controller) verification and synthesis in MDPs under distributional reach-avoidance specifications. By certified we mean that, along with a policy, we also aim to synthesize a (checkable) certificate ensuring that the MDP indeed satisfies the property. Thus, given the target set of distributions and an unsafe set of distributions over MDP states, our goal is to either synthesize a certificate for a given policy or synthesize a policy along with a certificate, proving that the target distribution can be reached while avoiding unsafe distributions. To solve this problem, we introduce the novel notion of distributional reach-avoid certificates and present automated procedures for (1) synthesizing a certificate for a given policy, and (2) synthesizing a policy together with the certificate, both providing formal guarantees on certificate correctness. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the ability of our method to solve several non-trivial examples, including a multi-agent robot-swarm model, to synthesize certified policies and to certify existing policies.</description>

      <title>Graded Monads and Behavioural Equivalence Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of graded semantics uses graded monads to capture behavioural equivalences of varying granularity, for example as found on the linear-time/branching-time spectrum, over general system types. We describe a generic Spoiler-Duplicator game for graded semantics that is extracted from the given graded monad, and may be seen as playing out an equational proof; instances include standard pebble games for simulation and bisimulation as well as games for trace-like equivalences and coalgebraic behavioural equivalence. Considerations on an infinite variant of such games lead to a novel notion of infinite-depth graded semantics. Under reasonable restrictions, the infinite-depth graded semantics associated to a given graded equivalence can be characterized in terms of a determinization construction for coalgebras under the equivalence at hand.</description>

      <title>The higher dimensional propositional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00435v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent research, some of the present authors introduced the concept of an n-dimensional Boolean algebra and its corresponding propositional logic nCL, generalising the Boolean propositional calculus to n&gt;= 2 perfectly symmetric truth values. This paper presents a sound and complete sequent calculus for nCL, named nLK. We provide two proofs of completeness: one syntactic and one semantic. The former implies as a corollary that nLK enjoys the cut admissibility property. The latter relies on the generalisation to the n-ary case of the classical proof based on the Lindenbaum algebra of formulas and Boolean ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>Mirroring Call-by-Need, or Values Acting Silly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Call-by-need evaluation for the lambda-calculus can be seen as merging the best of call-by-name and call-by-value, namely the wise erasing behaviour of the former and the wise duplicating behaviour of the latter. To better understand how duplication and erasure can be combined, we design a degenerated calculus, dubbed call-by-silly, that is symmetric to call-by-need in that it merges the worst of call-by-name and call-by-value, namely silly duplications by-name and silly erasures by-value.
  We validate the design of the call-by-silly calculus via rewriting properties and multi types. In particular, we mirror the main theorem about call-by-need -- that is, its operational equivalence with call-by-name -- showing that call-by-silly and call-by-value induce the same contextual equivalence. This fact shows the blindness with respect to efficiency of call-by-value contextual equivalence. We also define a call-by-silly strategy and measure its length via tight multi types. Lastly, we prove that the call-by-silly strategy computes evaluation sequences of maximal length in the calculus.</description>

      <title>What Formal Languages Can Transformers Express? A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As transformers have gained prominence in natural language processing, some researchers have investigated theoretically what problems they can and cannot solve, by treating problems as formal languages. Exploring such questions can help clarify the power of transformers relative to other models of computation, their fundamental capabilities and limits, and the impact of architectural choices. Work in this subarea has made considerable progress in recent years. Here, we undertake a comprehensive survey of this work, documenting the diverse assumptions that underlie different results and providing a unified framework for harmonizing seemingly contradictory findings.</description>

      <title>Boolean Variation and Boolean Logic BackPropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of variation is introduced for the Boolean set and based on which Boolean logic backpropagation principle is developed. Using this concept, deep models can be built with weights and activations being Boolean numbers and operated with Boolean logic instead of real arithmetic. In particular, Boolean deep models can be trained directly in the Boolean domain without latent weights. No gradient but logic is synthesized and backpropagated through layers.</description>

      <title>Indivisibility and uniform computational strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03919v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable structure is indivisible if for every coloring with finite range there is a monochromatic isomorphic subcopy of the structure. Each indivisible structure naturally corresponds to an indivisibility problem which outputs such a subcopy given a presentation and coloring. We investigate the Weihrauch complexity of the indivisibility problems for two structures: the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ as a linear order, and the equivalence relation $\mathscr{E}$ with countably many equivalence classes each having countably many members. We separate the Weihrauch degrees of both corresponding indivisibility problems from several benchmarks, showing in particular that the indivisibility problem for $\mathbb{Q}$ cannot solve the problem of finding a monochromatic rational interval given a coloring for which there is one; and that the Weihrauch degree of the indivisibility problem for $\mathscr{E}$ is strictly between those of $\mathsf{RT}^2$ and $\mathsf{SRT}^2$, two widely studied variants of Ramsey's theorem for pairs whose reverse-mathematical separation was open until recently.</description>
