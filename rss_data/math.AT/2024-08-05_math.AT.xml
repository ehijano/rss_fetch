      <title>Computation of $\gamma$-linear projected barcodes for multiparameter persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-linear projected barcode was recently introduced as an alternative to the well-known fibered barcode for multiparameter persistence, in which restrictions of the modules to lines are replaced by pushforwards of the modules along linear forms in the polar of some fixed cone $\gamma$. So far, the computation of the $\gamma$-linear projected barcode has only been studied in the functional setting, in which persistence modules come from the persistent cohomology of $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued functions. Here we develop a method that works in the algebraic setting directly, for any multiparameter persistence module over $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is given via a finite free resolution. Our approach is similar to that of RIVET: first, it pre-processes the resolution to build an arrangement in the dual of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a barcode template in each face of the arrangement; second, given any query linear form $u$ in the polar of $\gamma$, it locates $u$ within the arrangement to produce the corresponding barcode efficiently. While our theoretical complexity bounds are similar to the ones of RIVET, our arrangement turns out to be simpler thanks to the linear structure of the space of linear forms. Our theoretical analysis combines sheaf-theoretic and module-theoretic techniques, showing that multiparameter persistence modules can be converted into a special type of complexes of sheaves on vector spaces called conic-complexes, whose derived pushforwards by linear forms have predictable barcodes.</description>

      <title>Facets in the Vietoris--Rips complexes of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01288v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the facets of the Vietoris--Rips complex $\mathcal{VR}(Q_n; r)$ where $Q_n$ denotes the $n$-dimensional hypercube. We are particularly interested in those facets which are somehow independent of the dimension $n$. Using Hadamard matrices, we prove that the number of different dimensions of such facets is a super-polynomial function of the scale $r$, assuming that $n$ is sufficiently large. We show also that the $(2r-1)$-th dimensional homology of the complex $\mathcal{VR}(Q_n; r)$ is non-trivial when $n$ is large enough, provided that the Hadamard matrix of order $2r$ exists.</description>

      <title>Moderately discontinuous homology of real surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moderately Discontinuous Homology (MD-Homology, for short) was created recently in 2022 by Fern\'andez de Bobadilla at al. and it captures deep Lipschitz phenomena. However, to become a definitive powerful tool, it must be widely comprehended.
  In this paper, we investigate the MD-Homology of definable surface germs for the inner and outer metrics. We completely determine the MD-Homology of surfaces for the inner metric and we present a great variety of interesting MD-Homology of surfaces for the outer metric, for instance, we determine the MD-Homology of some bubbles, snake surfaces, and horns. Furthermore, we explicit the diversity of MD-Homology of surfaces for the outer metric in general, showing how hard it is to completely solve the outer classification problem. On the other hand, we show that, under specific conditions, the weakly outer Lipschitz equivalence determines completely the MD-Homology of surfaces for the outer metric, showing that these two subjects are quite related.</description>

      <title>Positivity of Peterson Schubert Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Peterson variety is a subvariety of the flag manifold $G/B$ equipped with an action of a one-dimensional torus, and a torus invariant paving by affine cells, called Peterson cells. We prove that the equivariant pull-backs of Schubert classes indexed by arbitrary Coxeter elements are dual (up to an intersection multiplicity) to the fundamental classes of Peterson cell closures. Dividing these classes by the intersection multiplicities yields a $\mathbb Z$-basis for the equivariant cohomology of the Peterson variety. We prove several properties of this basis, including a Graham positivity property for its structure constants, and stability with respect to inclusion in a larger Peterson variety. We also find formulae for intersection multiplicities with Peterson classes. This explains geometrically, in arbitrary Lie type, recent positivity statements proved in type A by Goldin and Gorbutt.</description>

      <title>Compact and finite-type support in the homology of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any infinite-type surface $S$, a natural question is whether the homology of its mapping class group contains any non-trivial classes that are supported on (i) a compact subsurface or (ii) a finite-type subsurface. Our purpose here is to study this question, in particular giving an almost-complete answer when the genus of $S$ is positive (including infinite) and a partial answer when the genus of $S$ is zero. Our methods involve the notion of shiftable subsurfaces as well as homological stability for mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>Computer-assisted methods in Sigma-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for recognizing whether a character belongs to $\Sigma^m$. In order to apply it we just need to know that the ambient group is of type $\mathrm{FP}_m$ or of type $\mathrm{F}_2$ and that the word problem is solvable for this group. Then finite data is sufficient proof of membership in $\Sigma^m$, not just for the given character but also for a neighborhood of it.</description>
