      <title>Localization and splitting of a quantum droplet by immersing a heavy impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central repulsive or attractive potential well mimicking the effect of a heavy impurity. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets fragment into two for increasing repulsive potential heights, a process that occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at the attractive potential, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for repulsive potentials as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of attractive potential wells. The many-body character of the dynamics is explicated by evaluating the participating single-particle eigenstates manifesting the superposition nature of the droplet state. Our results should be detectable by current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics with the aid of external potentials.</description>

      <title>Effective Interactions in Quasi-One-Dimensional Dipolar Quantum Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar atoms and molecules provide a flexible quantum simulation platform for studying strongly interacting many-body systems. Determining microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of the simulator is crucial for it to be useful. We study effective interactions emerging in quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) dipolar quantum gases, revealing significant nonuniversal corrections to the commonly used 1D pseudopotential. We demonstrate that a full 3D treatment employing realistic interaction potentials is essential for describing the reduced-dimensional system. Our findings are particularly relevant to experiments probing excited states and nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Turquoise Magic Wavelength of the ${}^{87}$Sr Clock Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks of fermionic strontium offer a versatile platform for probing fundamental physics and developing quantum technologies. The bivalent electronic structure of strontium gives rise to a doubly-forbidden atomic transition that is accessible due to hyperfine mixing in fermionic strontium-87, thus resulting in a sub-millihertz natural linewidth. Currently, the most accurate optical lattice clocks operate on this narrow transition by tightly trapping strontium-87 atoms in a {\em magic} optical lattice at 813~nm. {\em Magic} wavelengths occur where the Stark shifts of both the ground and excited states are equivalent, thus eliminating any position and intensity-dependent broadening of the corresponding transition. Theoretical calculations of the electronic structure of strontium-87 have also predicted another {\em magic} wavelength of the clock transition at 497.01(57)~nm. In this work, we experimentally measure the novel {\em magic} wavelength to be $497.4363(3)$~nm. Compared to the 813~nm {\em magic} wavelength, 497~nm is closer to the strong 461~nm dipolar transition of strontium, resulting in larger atomic polarizability by an order of magnitude, providing deeper traps with less optical power. The proximity to the 461~transition also leads to an enhanced sensitivity of 334(10)~Hz/(nm\,$E_{R}$) at the {\em magic} wavelength.</description>

      <title>Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$ numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: III. Thermodynamic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic consequences of the hidden Bose-Einstein singularities, which have been predicted to cause a pseudogap phase, based on quantum field theory of ordered phases. Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of thermodynamics: Maxwell relations for pair correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators hold enormous promise for advancing the modelling of materials and understanding emergent physics, such as high temperature superconductivity and topological order. While correlation functions are, typically, straightforward to measure in quantum simulators, thermodynamic properties are not. This limits our ability to directly compare the results of quantum simulations to experiments on the materials being modelled. Maxwell relations are an extremely powerful tool for characterising complex materials, as they enable the determination of challenging-to-measure thermodynamic properties from more accessible ones. Here, we introduce generalised Maxwell relations that relate every thermodynamic quantity to a single local correlation function. We illustrate their utility by deducing the thermodynamic properties of several iconic quantum many-body models from pair correlation functions using the generalised Maxwell relations. We show that this {universal} approach is readily accessible in quantum simulators and suggest applications to condensed matter systems where thermodynamic measurements are challenging, such as atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Long-range Order in a Short-range Quasi-2D XY Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase of spins in the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) XY model has emerged as a topic of significant interest across multiple physics subfields. Here, we propose a short-range (SR) Q2D XY model defined on a plane perpendicularly intersected by a group of parallel planes, with each plane consisting of nearest-neighbor-coupled XY spins. We perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to establish the full phase diagram of the Q2D XY model, aided by finite-size scaling. A long-range (LR) ordered phase emerges in the Q2D model when the spins on the parallel planes develop a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical phase. In the LR ordered phase, ordering is anisotropic: LR correlations develop along the direction of the intersection lines, while critical correlations emerge perpendicular to them. Furthermore, the LR ordered phase exhibits Goldstone-mode physics. Our study hence reveals the existence of LR order in a Q2D XY model with finite SR couplings and opens up a new avenue to explore superfluid orders in low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the origin of bound state in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound state in the continuum (BIC) and quasi-BIC represent a remarkable class of wave functions that disobey conventional intuition by exhibiting spatially localized modes embedded in the continuum spectrum. In recent years, these states have found important applications in interdisciplinary systems as a non-radiating mode with ultra-long lifetime. In these applications, a key question is how to convert a quasi-BIC into an exact BIC, and what the general criterion is for this transition. In this work, we uncover its origin using two steps in a two-band model with an arbitrary confining potential. Firstly, we demonstrate that a bound state coupled to a continuum band can yield quasi-BIC. Then, we show that tuning the coupling between the bands can convert the quasi-BIC into an exact BIC. In our theory, the real and complex poles of the spectra have a clear physical meaning for the quasi- and exact BICs, and we give the general criterion for exact BICs. Unlike previous proposals, our theory requires neither symmetry protection nor topological constraints and can be extended to a multiband model, providing a new framework for realizing BICs and offering new insights for their design in different fields, including photonics, acoustics, ultracold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensate with and without many-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Narrow-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling in the $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{2}$ metastable state of strontium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate narrow-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling of magnetically trapped strontium (Sr) in the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{2}$ state. A 641 nm standing-wave, blue-detuned from the $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$$\,\rightarrow$ $\,5p4d\,^{3}\textrm{F}_{4}$ transition, creates a dissipative optical lattice in the $^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ state. By combining Doppler cooling and Sisyphus cooling on the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{2}$$\,\rightarrow$ $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ transition at 2.92 ${\mu}$m, we observed efficient cooling of magnetically trapped atoms. By optically pumping the atoms to the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{0}$ state, we facilitate continuous outcoupling via a moving optical lattice with two fold improvement in atom number. Our scheme applies to next-generation quantum sensors using continuous ultracold atomic beams.</description>

      <title>Dynamical probe of the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in one-dimensional confined fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of a quenched quantum impurity immersed in a one-dimensional ultracold Fermi gas, focusing on the breakdown of the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation due to non-adiabatic effects. Despite a sizable impurity-bath mass imbalance, increasing interactions induce strong non-adiabatic couplings, disrupting adiabatic motion and enabling population transfer between the adiabatic potential energy curves. These transitions are governed by conical intersections arising from the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, dynamically shaping the impurity's motion through the bath. Using ab initio simulations via the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree method and a multi-channel Born-Oppenheimer framework, we track the impurity's evolution and directly prove the dynamical manifestation of the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect. We analyze two key scenarios: (i) a small initial shift, where a single avoided crossing drives transitions, and (ii) a large shift, where multiple avoided crossings lead to enhanced non-adiabaticity, self-trapping, and energy redistribution. Our findings establish ultracold fermionic few-body systems as tunable platforms for studying non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, opening new avenues for controlled impurity transport in strongly correlated environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experimentally, the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions dominate over Umklapp and boundary scattering events. In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase, due to the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electrons. Combined with unavoidable anharmonicity, the field-induced phase of the molecular wave-function gives rise to a geometric [Berry] phase for phonons and modifies three-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement, $\delta u_m$, of phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold atoms using Fermi-Hubbard models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.</description>

      <title>Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recently developed orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n$-Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo method arises for the double occupancy as well as qualitative agreement for the filling and compressibility across the Mott transition. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model as a useful alternative perspective for studying strong correlations in SU($N$) systems.</description>
