      <title>Non naturally reductive Einstein metrics on $\SU(N)$ via generalized flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new invariant Einstein metrics on the compact Lie group
  $\SU(N)$ which are not naturally reductive.
  This is achieved by using the generalized flag manifold $G/K=\SU(k_1+\cdots +k_p)/\s(\U(k_1)\times\cdots\times\U(k_p))$ and by taking an appropriate choice of orthogonal basis of the center of Lie subalgebra $\frak k$ for $K$, which poses
  certain symmetry conditions to the $\Ad(K)$-invariant metrics of $\SU(N)$. We also study the isometry problem for the Einstein metrics found.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Morphisms and Minimal Conformal Foliations on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Lie group equipped with a left-invariant Riemannian metric. Let $K$ be a semisimple and normal subgroup of $G$ generating a left-invariant conformal foliation $\F$ of on $G$. We then show that the foliation $\F$ is Riemannian and minimal. This means that locally the leaves of $\F$ are fibres of a harmonic morphism. We also prove that if the metric restricted to $K$ is biinvariant then $\F$ is totally geodesic.</description>

      <title>$\theta$-almost twisted Poisson cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson structure on manifolds which consists of introducing a closed 1-form $\theta$ in twisted Poisson structures satisfying some conditions. We give its characterization on low dimensional manifolds. We construct the Lie-Rinehart algebra on a 1-forms module on manifolds endowed with such structure. That induces a cochain complex, and therefore its cohomology named $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson cohomology. An example of $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson cohomology is given.</description>

      <title>Which singular tangent bundles are isomorphic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logarithmic and $b$-tangent bundles provide a versatile framework for addressing singularities in geometry. Introduced by Deligne and Melrose, these modified bundles resolve singularities by reframing singular vector fields as well-behaved sections of these singular bundles. This approach has gained significant attention in symplectic geometry, particularly through its applications to the study of Poisson manifolds that are symplectic away from a hypersurface ($b^m$-symplectic forms).
  In this article, we investigate the conditions under which these singular tangent bundles are isomorphic to the tangent bundle or other singular bundles, analyzing in detail the case of spheres. Furthermore, we establish a Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem for the $b^m$-tangent bundle, offering new insights into the interplay between singular structures and topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Lie theory of the slice Riemannian geometry on the quaternionic unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quaternionic unit ball carries a Riemannian metric built using regular M\"obius transformations: the slice Riemannian metric. We prove that the geometry induced by this metric is strongly related to the group $\mathrm{Sp}(1,1)$. We also develop the foundations for a Lie theoretic study of the slice Riemannian metric. In particular, we compute its isometry group and prove that it is built from symmetries of the Lie group $\mathrm{Sp}(1,1)$. We also compare the slice Riemannian geometry with the quaternionic Poincar\'e geometry, where the latter is considered within the setup of Riemannian symmetric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a compact, intrinsically symmetric submanifold of a Euclidean space is extrinsically symmetric if and only if its maximal tori are Clifford tori in the ambient space. Moreover, we show that this result can be used to give a geometric proof of a result of Harish-Chandra on strongly orthogonal roots in semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Plebanski complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is very well-known, linearisation of the instanton equations on a 4-manifold gives rise to an elliptic complex of differential operators, the truncated (twisted) Hodge complex $\Lambda^0(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Lambda^1(\mathfrak{g})\to \Lambda^2_+(\mathfrak{g})$. Moreover, the linearisation of the full YM equations also fits into this framework, as it is given by the second map followed by its adjoint. We define and study properties of what we call the Pleba\'nski complex. This is a differential complex that arises by linearisation of the equations implying that a Riemannian 4-manifold is hyper-K\"ahler. We recall that these are most naturally stated as the condition that there exists a perfect $\Sigma^i\wedge \Sigma^j\sim\delta^{ij}$ triple $\Sigma^i, i=1,2,3$ of 2-forms that are closed $d\Sigma^i=0$. The Riemannian metric is encoded by the 2-forms $\Sigma^i$. We show that what results is an elliptic differential complex $TM \to S\to E\times \Lambda^1 \to E$, where $S$ is the tangent space to the space of perfect triples, and $E=\mathbb{R}^3$. We also show that, as in the case with instanton equations, the full Einstein equations $Ric=0$ also fit into this framework, their linearisation being given by the second map followed by its adjoint. Our second result concerns the elliptic operator that the Pleba\'nski complex defines. In the case of the instanton complex, operators appearing in the complex supplemented with their adjoints assemble to give the Dirac operator. We show how the same holds true for the Pleba\'nski complex. Supplemented by suitable adjoints, operators assemble into an elliptic operator that squares to the Laplacian and is given by the direct sum of two Dirac operators.</description>

Abstract: This work studies simply connected, noncompact $G/H$ in which $G$ is semi-simple, $H$ is connected, and $G/H$ has two irreducible summands. Here, we classify all such spaces and we provide solutions to the so-called Prescribed Ricci Curvature problem for all such spaces.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) Method for NURBS-based Conformal Surface Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of computer graphics, conformal surface flattening has been widely studied for tasks such as texture mapping, geometry processing, and mesh generation. Typically, existing methods aim to flatten a given input geometry while preserving conformality as much as possible, meaning the result is only as conformal as possible. By contrast, this study focuses on surfaces that can be flattened conformally without singularities, making the process a coupled problem: the input (or target) surface must be recursively refined while its flattening is computed.
  Although the uniformization theorem or the Riemann mapping theorem guarantees the existence of a conformal flattening for any simply connected, orientable surface, those theorems permit singularities in the flattening. If singularities are not allowed, only a special class of surfaces can be conformally flattened-though many practical surfaces do fall into this class.
  To address this, we develop a NURBS-based approach in which both the input surface and its flattening are refined in tandem, ensuring mutual conformality. Because NURBS surfaces cannot represent singularities, the resulting pair of surfaces is naturally singularity-free. Our work is inspired by the form-finding method by [Miki and Mitchell 2022, 2024], which solves bilinear PDEs by iteratively refining two surfaces together. Building on their demonstration of the effectiveness of variable projection (VarPro), we adopt a similar strategy: VarPro alternates between a linear projection and a nonlinear iteration, leveraging a partially linear (separable) problem structure. However, since our conformal condition separates into two nonlinear subproblems, we introduce a nonlinear extension of VarPro. Although this significantly increases computational cost, the quality of the results is noteworthy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Weyl law for the volume spectrum in a compact Riemannian manifold conjectured by Gromov can be derived from parametric generalizations of two famous inequalities: isoperimetric inequality and coarea inequality. We prove two such generalizations in low dimensions and obtain the Weyl law for 1-cycles in 3-manifolds. We also give a new proof of the Almgren isomorphism theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08154v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the concept of ``fat bundles'' within Riemannian submersions. One explores the structural implications of fat Riemannian submersions, particularly focusing on those with non-negative sectional curvature. The main results include the classification of fibers as symmetric spaces, the isometric correspondence of fat foliations with coset foliations on Lie groups, and the rigidity of dual foliations associated with fat Riemannian submersions.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hodge Theorem: curl and asymmetric pseudodifferential projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit.</description>

      <title>Metrizability and Dynamics of Weil Bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper bridges synthetic and classical differential geometry by investigating the metrizability and dynamics of Weil bundles. For a smooth, compact manifold \(M\) and a Weil algebra \(\mathbf{A}\), we prove that the manifold \(M^\mathbf{A}\) of \(\mathbf{A}\)-points admits a canonical, complete, weighted metric \(\mathfrak{d}_w\) that encodes both base-manifold geometry and infinitesimal deformations. Key results include: (1) Metrization: \(\mathfrak{d}_w\) induces a complete metric topology on \(M^\mathbf{A}\). (2) Path Lifting: Curves lift from \(M\) to \(M^\mathbf{A}\) while preserving topological invariants. (3) Dynamics: Fixed-point theorems for diffeomorphisms on \(M^\mathbf{A}\) connected to stability analysis. (4) Topological Equivalence: \(H^*(M^\mathbf{A}) \cong H^*(M)\) and \(\pi_\ast(M^\mathbf{A}) \cong \pi_\ast(M)\).</description>

As a corollary, we construct self-diffeomorphisms of $4$-manifolds with boundary that fix the boundary and act trivially on homology but cannot be isotoped to any self-diffeomorphism supported in a collar of the boundary and, in particular, are not isotopic to any generalised Dehn twist.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the slice regular M\"obius transformations of the quaternionic unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the quaternionic unit ball $\mathbb{B}$, let us denote by $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ the set of slice regular M\"obius transformations mapping $\mathbb{B}$ onto itself. We introduce a smooth manifold structure on $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$, for which the evaluation(-action) map of $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ on $\mathbb{B}$ is smooth. The manifold structure considered on $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ is obtained by realizing this set as a quotient of the Lie group $\mathrm{Sp}(1,1)$, Furthermore, it turns out that $\mathbb{B}$ is a quotient as well of both $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ and $\mathrm{Sp}(1,1)$. These quotients are in the sense of principal fiber bundles. The manifold $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{B})$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^4 \times S^3$.</description>
