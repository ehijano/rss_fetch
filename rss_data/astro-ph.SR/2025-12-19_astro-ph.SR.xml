      <title>Bright Long Secondary Period Stars for Follow-up Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long secondary period (LSP) variable stars are a subclass of long-period variables (LPV) that exhibit additional long-term variability alongside pulsations. Despite being observed in over 30% of LPVs, the reason behind the LSP phenomenon is still debated. The most favoured explanation, supported by recent growing evidence, is binarity, where the pulsating giant star has a substellar-mass companion. To further test this hypothesis, it is important to identify bright LSP variables, for which high-quality spectroscopic and interferometric observations can be obtained more easily. Motivated by the absence of a catalog of bright nearby LSPs, we searched the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data in the $V$-band magnitude range 5.5-14 mag, and for declinations $&lt; +28^\circ$. The resulting catalog contains 23 LSPs, 13 of which are new discoveries. We compare our catalog with the LSP lists available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the origin of the elements. X. Combining NLTE and machine learning for chemical diagnostics of 4 million stars in the 4MIDABLE-HR survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 4MOST-HR resolution Non-Local Thermal Equilibrium (NLTE) Payne artificial neural network (ANN), trained on 404,793 new FGK spectra with 16 elements computed in NLTE. This network will be part of the Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline (SAPP), which will analyse 4 million stars during the five year long 4MOST consortium 4: MIlky way Disc And BuLgE High-Resolution (4MIDABLE-HR) survey. A fitting algorithm using this ANN is also presented that is able to fully-automatically and self-consistently derive both stellar parameters and elemental abundances. The ANN is validated by fitting 121 observed spectra of low-mass FGKM type stars, including main-sequence dwarf, subgiant and giant stars down to [Fe/H] $\approx -3.4$ degraded to 4MOST-HR resolution, and comparing the derived abundances with the output of the classical radiative transfer code TSFitPy. We are able to recover all 18 elemental abundances with a bias &lt;0.13 and spread &lt;0.16 dex, although the typical values are &lt;0.09 dex for most elements. These abundances are compared to the OMEGA+ Galactic Chemical Evolution model, showcasing for the first time, the expected performance and results obtained from high-resolution spectra of the quality expected to be obtained with 4MOST. The expected Galactic trends are recovered, and we highlight the potential of using many chemical elements to constrain the formation history of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>IPA. Accretion rate of a low-mass Class 0 protostar, measured via mid-infrared fluorescent OH emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earliest stages of star formation are highlighted by complex interactions between accretion, outflow, and radiative processes, which shape the chemical and physical environment of the emerging protostar. James Webb Space Telescope observations of the low-mass, low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 reveal a central compact source. This object exhibits a rich mid-infrared emission spectrum of OH pure rotational lines and $\rm CO_2$ ro-vibrational lines. Unusually for a young stellar object, it has no mid-infrared line emission from $\rm H_2O$ to match the other molecules. We demonstrate that the emitting OH molecules arise from UV photodissociation of $\rm H_2O$ in its second absorption band at $\lambda = 114-145$ nm, and that the OH emission is a fluorescent cascade starting with highest-excitation rotational states. This situation offers the opportunity of using the infrared OH spectrum to measure the UV flux from the central protostar. Thereby we determine the disk-star accretion rate to be $3 \times 10^{-10} \ M_\sun \ {\rm year^{-1}}$, and demonstrate that the system luminosity arises mostly from the protostar's photosphere rather than from accretion luminosity. The result is in accord with the measured outflow rate of IRAS 16253-2429 and lies within the outflow/accretion-flow rate trend often inferred for protostars; and with episodic accretion as the dominant mechanism by which this protostar has grown.</description>

      <title>Direct calculation of steady-state hydrodynamic solar wind solutions with newtonian viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are known to admit solutions that are singular at the sonic point. Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Smooth-Fit Extrapolation of the $^{12}\mathrm{C}+{}^{12}\mathrm{C}$ Astrophysical $S$ Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bayesian analysis of the astrophysical $S$ factor for the $^{12}\mathrm{C}+^{12}\mathrm{C}$ fusion reaction is presented, based on available experimental information at carbon--carbon relative energies $E \gtrsim 2~\mathrm{MeV}$, including direct measurements, indirect Coulomb-renormalized Trojan Horse Method (THM) results, and recent inverse-kinematics data. The Bayesian inference is performed on the quantity $\log_{10}S^{*}(E)$ rather than on $S^{*}(E)$ itself, which naturally accommodates the wide dynamic range of the data and leads to approximately Gaussian uncertainties. The logarithm of the astrophysical factor is parametrized by a quadratic polynomial in energy, and the posterior distribution of the fit coefficients is determined using a weighted Bayesian regression. From this posterior, a global median $S^{*}(E)$ curve is constructed, and the associated covariance matrix is used to define a low/medium/high (LO/MED/HI) band corresponding to a $68\%$ credible interval.
  Particular emphasis is placed on the extrapolation below $E_{\mathrm{cm}}=2~\mathrm{MeV}$, where the fusion reaction rate is most relevant for stellar carbon burning. At $E_{\mathrm{cm}}=1.5~\mathrm{MeV}$, the posterior distribution yields $S_{\mathrm{global}}^{*}(1.5~\mathrm{MeV})= \left(2.13^{+0.01}_{-0.01}\right)\times10^{16}\,\mathrm{keV\,b}, $ corresponding to a $68\%$ credible interval. The extracted result is consistent with recent inverse-kinematics measurements and with Coulomb-corrected Trojan Horse Method constraints, providing a tightly constrained estimate of the $^{12}\mathrm{C}+^{12}\mathrm{C}$ fusion $S$ factor in the energy region relevant for stellar carbon burning.</description>

      <title>Infrared SED Modeling of Velocity-Excess Maser Sources: Identifying Incipient Water-Fountain Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated whether "velocity excess" in circumstellar maser lines can diagnose the earliest evolutionary phases of Water Fountains (WFs). Here we define "velocity excess" as maser emission (e.g., H$_2$O 22.235 GHz or OH 1665/1667 MHz) detected at velocities outside the velocity range of the OH 1612 MHz line, which traces the terminal expansion velocity of a spherical circumstellar envelope (CSE). Such excess velocities serve as an indicator of gas motions deviating from spherical expansion and may signify the onset of asymmetric outflows. Based on recent studies (Fan et al.2024; Xie et al.2025), we analyzed 17 sources showing velocity excess and fitted their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with the one-dimensional radiative transfer code DUSTY. Seven sources are well reproduced, implying outer CSEs that remain nearly spherical despite inner asymmetries. Among these, five exhibit single-peaked, AGB-like SEDs and two show double-peaked, post-AGB-like profiles. IRAS variability indices and NEOWISE-R light curves reveal pulsations (~600-1000 days) in three sources, supporting their AGB classification. Considering the magnitude of the velocity excess, two objects-IRAS 19229+1708 and IRAS 19052+0922-may represent the earliest or incipient WF phase, in which asymmetric outflows are beginning to emerge within otherwise spherical envelopes. These results support a morphological sequence in which bipolar jets and tori arise first in the central regions while the outer CSE remains spherical, and they show that selecting WF candidates via velocity excess effectively identifies objects at the onset of jet formation and early morphological transformation.</description>

      <title>Weakened Inspirals I: High Mass Ratio Common Envelope Interactions in RGB Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common envelope (CE) interaction between an expanding giant star and a compact companion typically leads to a rapid orbital decay, ending in either a merger or the formation of a close binary. However, the existence of post-red giant and post-asymptotic giant branch binaries with separations of 100 to 800 Rsun challenges this standard picture, as these systems appear to have experienced strong interactions without undergoing a classic CE inspiral. In this work, we investigate the effect of high mass ratio, q = M2/M1, on the CE inspiral using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations performed with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM. The primary is a 0.88 Msun, 90 Rsun red giant branch star, while the companion masses span q = 0.68 to 1.5. Higher mass ratios lead to wider post-CE separations, with a maximum of approximately 40 Rsun. The pre-CE mass transfer phase is longer for larger companion masses, and for q greater than or equal to 1 the inspiral becomes significantly more stable, broadly consistent with analytical expectations. This phase is not fully converged with respect to numerical resolution, and higher resolution simulations are expected to further increase its duration and stability. Although higher q systems show enhanced mass loss through the L2 and L3 Lagrange points, we find that circumbinary discs are more likely to form from fallback of bound envelope material. Fallback times are short, of order a few hundred years, and fallback radii lie well outside the binary, between 0.5 and 5 au, where discs are expected to spread efficiently through viscous torques. While high mass ratio systems produce wider post-interaction separations, these remain smaller than those observed. In contrast, fallback-formed discs have properties consistent with observed circumbinary discs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic protons (SEPs) in different energy channels from 10 to above 100 MeV are analyzed and their relationship to solar and geomagnetic activity is investigated. We performed temporal association analysis between the SEPs, solar flares (SFs), coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and geomagnetic storms (GSs) that occurred during solar cycles 23 and 24. The energy dependencies between the SEPs and the strength of the space weather activity are evaluated and presented.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a rapidly evolving global magnetic field in the M-dwarf YZ Cet and constraints on the magnetic field of its planet YZ Cet b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectropolarimetric study of the nearby M4.5V exoplanet host star YZ Cet, based on near-infrared observations obtained with the SpectroPolarim\`etre InfraRouge (SPIRou) at the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope. We detect striking changes in the large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry over the course of just a few stellar rotations, a level of short-term global magnetic field evolution rarely reported in M dwarfs. We modeled the temporal variation of the longitudinal magnetic field using a Gaussian regression process, which allowed us to robustly determine the stellar rotation period and quantify the evolution timescale of the magnetic field. Independent Zeeman Doppler Imaging reconstructions of the two epochs confirm a significant reconfiguration of the star's global magnetic strength and topology. The detection of a weaker, complex, axisymmetric magnetic field (mean $|B| \sim 201$~G), which changes into a stronger, non-axisymmetric, dipole-dominated field (mean $|B| \sim 276$~G) over a few rotation cycles, is in contrast to results from similar fully convective M-dwarf stars. YZ Cet is known to exhibit polarized radio bursts potentially driven by auroral radio emission from star--planet interaction (SPI). By combining our magnetic maps with recent radio observations, we refine the constraints on the magnetic field strength of the innermost planet, YZ Cet b. These results underscore the importance of monitoring stellar magnetic variability to interpret multi-wavelength SPI signatures and to characterize the magnetospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present report is to outline the observational methods used to determine the solar origin - in terms of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - of the in situ observed solar energetic protons. Several widely used guidelines are given and different sources of uncertainties are summarized and discussed. In the present study, a new quality factor is proposed as a certainty check on the so-identified flare-CME pairs. In addition, the correlations between the proton peak intensity and the properties of their solar origin are evaluated as a function of the quality factor.</description>

      <title>High mass accretion rates onto evolved stripped-envelope massive stars by jet-induced mass removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating one-dimensional stellar evolution models with MESA, we show that removing the outer inflated envelope of a mass-accreting evolved stripped-envelope star, like a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star, substantially moderates the stellar expansion during accretion at high-mass accretion rates. We study the accretion onto a star via an accretion disk, which launches jets that remove the high-entropy outer layers of the inflated envelope. This is the `jetted mass removal accretion scenario.' By manually removing the entire hydrogen-rich envelope from a red supergiant, we build a hydrogen-deficient WR stellar model with a mass of 6.03Mo and a radius of 0.67Ro. We then accrete mass onto it at a high rate. We mimic the real process of simultaneous mass addition near the equatorial plane and jet-induced mass removal from the outer envelope by dividing the accretion period into hundreds of pulses: in the first half of each pulse, we add mass, and in the second, we remove a fraction of this mass. The removal of tens of percent from the added mass decreases the stellar expansion by a factor of about 2-5. Our results show that WR stars can maintain a deep potential well and not expand much while accreting mass at high rates. This allows the formation of an accretion disk and the liberation of large amounts of gravitational energy. Our results strengthen models of intermediate-luminosity optical transients, such as luminous red novae, in which a non-degenerate star accretes at high rates and launches jets that power the transient event.</description>

      <title>The Preliminary Mauve Science Programme: Science themes identified for the first year of operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mauve is a low-cost small satellite developed and operated by Blue Skies Space Ltd. The payload features a 13 cm telescope connected with a fibre that feeds into a UV-Vis spectrometer. The detector covers the 200-700 nm range in a single shot, obtaining low resolution spectra at R~20-65. Mauve has launched on 28th November 2025, reaching a 510 km Low-Earth Sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite will enable UV and visible observations of a variety of stellar objects in our Galaxy, filling the gaps in the ultraviolet space-based data. The researchers that have already joined the mission have defined the science themes, observational strategy and targets that Mauve will observe in the first year of operations. To date, 10 science themes have been developed by the Mauve science collaboration for year 1, with observational strategies that include both long duration monitoring and short cadence snapshots. Here, we describe these themes and the science that Mauve will undertake in its first year of operations.</description>

      <title>SNR 1987A : Spitzer data from days 6000 to 8000 revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excess emission has been observed by Spitzer in the [3, 5] micron range of the SNR 1987A spectrum. It is generally argued that this excess could be due to the presence of warm amorphous carbon dust in the equatorial ring (ER) around the supernova, but the proposed models all have problems. This prompted us to present an alternative view on the interpretation of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of SNR 1987A from the near-IR wavelengths to the radio frequencies (from 3 micron up to 1.4 GHz), between 6000 and 8000 days after outburst. We argue that the origin of that excess could be attributed instead to a free-free emission. We show that under very specific conditions (the free-free is self-absorbed at a cut-off frequency imposed by the mass of the emitting region), it could be produced by collisional heating of the gas. We then discuss the time evolution of the various components of the SED. We establish a linear relationship between the growth of the warm carbon dust mass and that of the silicates dust during the analyzed period. Finally, we build the Spitzer light curves and we show that our models reproduce the observations pretty well, although our study clearly favors the free-free case. In conclusion, we argue that the free-free model provides a formally very good description of the data, however the model does require some very specific parameter choices, and results in an unusually low temperature for the ionized gas.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of white dwarfs in the 2040s</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs, the final evolutionary stage of the vast majority of stars, serve as critical tools for cosmochronology, studies of planetary system evolution, and laboratories for non-standard physics, including exotic cooling channels and weakly interacting particles, as well as crystallization processes. Beyond surface properties accessible via spectroscopy and model atmospheres, global pulsations exhibited by white dwarfs during various evolutionary phases provide a direct window into their deep interiors. Asteroseismology, the comparison of observed pulsation periods with theoretical models, enables us to infer internal chemical stratification, total mass, rotation profiles, and magnetic field strengths. Despite major advances from space missions providing uninterrupted, high-precision photometry, key challenges remain: many predicted pulsators remain quiet, while others oscillate outside theoretical instability strips, highlighting gaps in our understanding of mode excitation, diffusion, and convective mixing. Determining the masses of white dwarfs, particularly for massive and hydrogen-deficient stars, remains uncertain, with discrepancies between spectroscopic, asteroseismic, astrometric, and photometric methods. In the coming decades, large-scale surveys combining high-precision space-based photometry with coordinated ground-based spectroscopic follow-up will dramatically increase both the number and quality of pulsating white dwarf observations.</description>

      <title>Sailing to the next safe harbour in our trip to the early Universe: The massive star population of metal-poor galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very metal-poor massive stars in the Local Group are our best proxies for the Universe's first stars, making them essential for modeling reionization and early galactic chemical evolution. Studying such stars in our Local Universe is key to extrapolating our knowledge to more distant regions, where individual massive stars cannot be resolved but are dynamically and chemically shaping their environments. The MUSE integral field spectrograph has transformed massive star studies in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, but resolving star-forming galaxies containing very metal-poor stars is at the limit of the current field of view and sensitivity. Therefore, only small dedicated efforts of selected regions are studied, providing us with snapshots of low-metallicity massive stars rather than a comprehensive picture. This scarcity is a major bottleneck for understanding and sufficiently modelling the evolution and feedback of massive stars across cosmic time. We therefore envision a new generation of panoramic integral-field spectrographs and high multiplex multi-object spectrographs mounted on dedicated large optical telescopes. Such facilities will not only allow to resolve very-metal-pool galaxies, but further enable the systematic exploration of the massive stellar content across the entire Local Group, thereby reaching a new era in massive star studies and understanding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novae are thermonuclear explosions on the surface of accreting white dwarfs and are key laboratories for studying explosive nucleosynthesis, particle acceleration, shock physics, and binary evolution. Despite major progress driven by wide-field time-domain surveys and multi-wavelength facilities, our understanding of nova explosions remains limited by incomplete temporal coverage, heterogeneous spectroscopic follow-up, and poorly constrained ejecta properties. In this white paper we outline the open scientific questions that will define nova research in the 2040s, focusing on the mass, composition, geometry, and dynamics of the ejecta, the role of the underlying binary system, and the connection between nuclear burning, shocks, and emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. We argue that decisive progress requires rapid-response, high-cadence, multi-wavelength observations, anchored by systematic high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy from eruption to quiescence. Finally, we identify key technological requirements needed to enable transformative advances in the physics of nova explosions over the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Binarity Beyond Gaia: The case for a dedicated spectroscopic survey of binary stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar multiplicity is a fundamental ingredient of stellar astrophysics, yet binary statistics across the Galaxy remain poorly constrained. The \emph{Gaia} mission has revolutionised binary star astrophysics by delivering high-precision astrometry, photometry and global radial velocities, and by providing hundreds of thousands of non-single-star solutions in DR3. However, the RVS magnitude limit, mission time span and scanning law impose strong selection effects in period, mass ratio, inclination and semi-amplitude, leaving large regions of the binary parameter space either sparsely sampled or effectively inaccessible. In this white paper we outline the case for a dedicated, wide-field, multi-epoch spectroscopic survey explicitly optimised for binary science: deeper than the \emph{Gaia} RVS limit, with flexible cadence from hours to years, and with moderate to high spectral resolution. Using a simplified forward model of \emph{Gaia} DR5-like performance, we highlight the populations for which robust orbital solutions will be rare (ultra short period, very long period, low-amplitude and compact-object binaries), and show how a ``Binarity Beyond \emph{Gaia}'' survey would fill these gaps. Such a programme would deliver a bias correctable census of stellar multiplicity across the Milky Way and provide the spectroscopic backbone needed to exploit binary samples from \emph{Rubin}/LSST, \emph{Roman} and \emph{LISA}.</description>

      <title>Astrometric and Spectroscopic Analysis of IC 2714: An Open Cluster Hosting a Lithium-Rich Giant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open clusters serve as laboratories to study and evaluate stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution models. Chemical peculiarities, such as lithium-rich giants, are rarely observed in these stellar systems. This work focuses on eight red giants (#005, #028, #034, #053, #087, #121, #126, and #190) previously reported as members of the Galactic cluster IC 2714. We conducted a detailed investigation using high-resolution spectroscopy, supplemented with data from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Besides deriving the cluster's fundamental parameters, we provide the most thorough chemical characterization of IC 2714 to date, reporting the abundance of 23 species, including light elements (Li, C, N, O), odd-Z elements (Na, Al), $\alpha$-elements (Si, Ca, Ti, Mg), iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Ni), $\textit{s}$-process-dominated elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd) and $\textit{r}$-process elements (Sm, Eu). We also present the carbon isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C for the first time for seven stars. One particular star (#087) exhibits a high lithium abundance ($\log \varepsilon$(Li)$_{\rm NLTE}$ = $+$1.54 dex) and a slightly higher projected rotational velocity ($v \sin i$ = 6.7 km s$^{-1}$). Our results suggest that the analyzed stars are in the core-helium-burning phase of evolution, where the most lithium-rich giants are found. Combining astrometric probabilities and chemical abundances, we conclude that two giants (#028 and #034) might not be cluster members.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Modeling of DSHARP Dusty Disks: Asymmetric Structures and Inner-Disk Dispersal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution observations of Class II protoplanetary disks frequently reveal annular structures that may indicate the presence of embedded planets. In this study, we model brightness profiles and geometries for 16 dusty disks in the DSHARP observations to identify asymmetric substructures, including possible planet-induced signatures. We find no compelling evidence for circumplanetary emission in these systems. We identify a possible one-armed spiral in Elias 27; while previous studies report an $m=2$ spiral, the morphology of the newly identified spiral agrees with a spiral for a possible protoplanet. Although non-detection of circumplanetary emission is consistent with low expected luminosities, the absence of additional dust spirals except for Elias 27 may constrain properties of potential embedded planets given their theoretical detectability. The analyses further suggest that spiral amplitudes and phases correlated with gap and ring locations in WaOph 6 and IM Lup, appearing as deflections of spirals in images. Five disks exhibit strong residual asymmetries attributable to the vertical extent of their dust layers. We find that the brightness temperature of inner disks ($1$-$5$ au) declines with stellar age on a $\sim 3$ Myr timescale, while the total flux shows no clear decreasing trend. This trend is consistent with the presence of pressure bumps that retain large dust grains at outer radii, while allowing the inner disks to disperse. The universality of disk dispersal timescale at millimeter wavelengths, observed in both the extended DSHARP disks and the compact disks from previous demographic surveys, may constrain timing of planet formation, including habitable planets.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the anomaly in the production of $^{60}$Fe nucleus in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of $^{60}$Fe is crucial for nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. In this work, by using the microscopic EP+IPM (exact pairing plus the independent-particle model) for the nuclear level density (NLD) and extended EP+PDM (exact pairing plus phonon damping model) for the $\gamma$-ray strength function (gSF), we re-evaluate the substantial enhancement of $^{60}$Fe production recently reported in {\it A. Spyrou et al., Nat. Comm. {\bf 15}, 9608 (2024)}, which was attributed to an unexpectedly large Maxwellian-averaged cross section (MACS). Our analysis demonstrates that this enhancement indeed originates from the choice of NLD, which, despite being constrained to reproduce the total NLD and gSF data, lacks a reliable spin dependence, a critical input for Hauser-Feshbach calculations of nuclear reaction rate. In contrast, our predictions yield a significantly lower MACS, calling the claimed enhancement into question. In particular, our approach highlights the microscopic nature of the low-energy enhancement of the gSF, the so-called upbend resonance, which arises from strong particle-particle ($pp$) and hole-hole ($hh$) excitations that emerge only at finite temperature, thereby further reinsisting on the invalidity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis in this low-energy region. Overall, our study reopens the question on the long-standing problem of $^{60}$Fe production in massive stars.</description>

      <title>A Square Kilometre Array Pulsar Census</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the pulsar science case with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) depends on long-term precision pulsar timing of a large number of pulsars, as well as astrometric measurements of these using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). But before we can time them, or VLBI them, we must first find them. Here, we describe the considerations and strategies one needs to account for when planning an all-sky blind pulsar survey using the SKA. Based on our understanding of the pulsar population, the performance of the now-under-construction SKA elements, and practical constraints such as evading radio frequency interference, we project pulsar survey yields using two complementary methods for a number of illustrative survey designs, combining SKA1-Low and SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2 in a variety of ways. A composite survey using both Mid and Low is optimal, with Mid Band 2 focused in the plane. We find that, given its much higher effective area and survey speed, the best strategy is to use SKA1-Low to cover as much sky as possible, ideally also overlapping with the areas covered by Mid. In our most realistic scenario, we find that an all-sky blind survey with Phase 1 of the SKA with the AA* array assembly will detect $\sim10,000$ slow pulsars and $\sim 800$ millisecond pulsars (MSPs) if SKA1-Mid covers the region within $5\deg$ of the plane, while higher latitudes will be covered with SKA1-Low. The yield with AA4 is $\sim 20\%$ higher. One could increase these numbers by increasing the range covered by SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2, at the cost of a considerably longer survey. The pulsar census will enable us to set new constraints on the uncertain physical properties of the entire neutron star population. This will be crucial for addressing major SKA science questions including the dense-matter equation of state, strong-field gravity tests, and gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Pulsars in Globular Clusters With the SKAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of their extreme stellar densities, globular clusters are highly efficient factories of X-ray binaries and radio pulsars: per unit of stellar mass, they contain about 1000 times more of these exotic objects. Thus far, 345 radio pulsars have been found in globular clusters. These can be used as precision probes of the structure, gas content, magnetic field, and dynamic history of their host clusters; some of them are also highly interesting in their own right because they probe exotic stellar evolution scenarios as well as the physics of dense matter, accretion, and gravity; one of them (PSR~J0514$-$4002E) might even be the first pulsar - black hole system known. Deep searches with SKA-MID and SKA-LOW will only require one to a few tied-array beams, and can be done during early commissioning of the telescope, before an all-sky pulsar survey using hundreds to thousands of tied-array beams is feasible. Even a conservative approach predicts new discoveries only with the core of SKA-MID AA*, and the full AA* and eventually AA4 is expected to increase the number of discoveries even more, leading to more than doubling the current known population. This offers a great opportunity for early SKAO pulsar science, even before all the collecting area is in place. On the other hand, a more optimistic prediction calls for a 4-5 times growth of the population, leading to a total of about 1700 pulsars to be detectable with SKA-MID AA4 configuration in all Galactic GCs visible by SKA telescopes. Thus, a dedicated search for pulsars in globular clusters will fully exploit the best possible natural laboratories to study many branches of physics and astrophysics, including properties of dense matter, stellar evolution, and the dynamical history of the Galactic globular cluster systems.</description>

      <title>Testing Gravity with Binary Pulsars in the SKA Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary (and trinary) radio pulsars are natural laboratories in space for understanding gravity in the strong field regime, with many unique and precise tests carried out so far, including the most precise tests of the strong equivalence principle and of the radiative properties of gravity. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, with its high sensitivity in the Southern Hemisphere, will vastly improve the timing precision of recycled pulsars, allowing for a deeper search of potential deviations from general relativity (GR) in currently known systems. A Galactic census of pulsars will, in addition, will yield the discovery of dozens of relativistic pulsar systems, including potentially pulsar -- black hole binaries, which can be used to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis and the ``no-hair'' theorem. Aspects of gravitation to be explored include tests of strong equivalence principles, gravitational dipole radiation, extra field components of gravitation, gravitomagnetism, and spacetime symmetries. In this chapter, we describe the kinds of gravity tests possible with binary pulsar and outline the features and abilities that SKA must possess to best contribute to this science.</description>

      <title>Expanding Horizons - Transforming Astronomy in the 2040s Time-Domain Multi-Messenger Astronomy in the 2040s: EM Follow-up of LGWA Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coming decades will see gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy expand decisively into the mHz-Hz frequency range, opening access to a population of compact binaries that are currently invisible or only detectable moments before merger. The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) concept is designed to probe this gap, enabling continuous observation of compact binaries over months to years prior to coalescence, and detecting sources inaccessible to both space-based mHz detectors and current ground-based &gt;10 Hz facilities. This new GW window fundamentally alters the landscape of time-domain multi-messenger astronomy. Rather than reacting to mergers after the fact, LGWA enables predictive, scheduled electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, transforming how compact-object mergers, their environments, and their astrophysical channels are studied. However, fully exploiting LGWA discoveries requires EM capabilities that do not exist today and are unlikely to be available by the 2030s, particularly for wide-area, rapid, spectroscopically rich follow-up at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This White Paper identifies the key science cases enabled by LGWA that motivate new ground-based capabilities in the 2040s.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Evolution and Detectability of Nova Remnants in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\sim{10^{6}~\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\sim{10~\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$\alpha$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\sim10^{32}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\sim10^{31}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\%, 8\%, and 18\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$\alpha$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe Discovery of an X-ray Flare from K-type Star PM J23221-0301</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares are an intense stellar activity that can significantly impact the atmospheric composition of the surrounding planets and even the possible existence of life. During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation. This discovery underscores EP's capability in understanding stellar magnetic activity via observing stellar transients.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Kinematic Structure in the Young Association Serpens OB2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Serpens OB2 association (l ~ 18.5 deg, b ~ 1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex ~65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending ~50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic plane, while the YSOs are generally younger and more strongly clustered around molecular-cloud clumps detected in 13CO MWISP data. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales &lt;2 pc, two-point velocity statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual, but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The expansion of the H II region Sh 2-54, powered by the association's OB stars, may be accelerating the star-forming cloud away from the plane given the system's geometry, plausibly inducing the vertical stellar velocity gradient. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.</description>

      <title>The WINTER Observatory: A One-Degree InGaAs Survey Camera to study the Transient Infrared Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new near-infrared time-domain survey instrument installed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of the recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for near-infrared photometry without cryogenic cooling. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt;1 degree-squared field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.</description>

      <title>A Radio Search for Star-Planet Interaction in TOI-540 and SPECULOOS-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first targeted centimeter-band radio observations of two recently-discovered exoplanet systems that are prime candidates for magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI): TOI-540 and SPECULOOS-3. The targets were selected due to the small orbital separation of their known planets, as well as for indications of stellar magnetic activity, given that for SPI radio emission may be strongest when a sufficiently magnetized star hosts a close-in planet. The deep, multi-epoch Very Large Array (SPECULOOS-3) and MeerKAT (TOI-540) observations yield non-detections, with $3\sigma$ limits of $\lesssim 7.5$ $\mu$Jy ($4-8$ GHz) and $\lesssim 30-80$ $\mu$Jy ($0.8-1.7$ GHz), respectively. For SPECULOOS-3 b we rule out observable SPI for most of its orbit, while for TOI-540 b we sample a narrower range, around planetary transit. We model possible planetary magnetic field strength constraints for both systems, and conclude that our observations are sensitive enough to sample SPI emission in these systems if present and directed at us, even for a planetary field of only $\sim 1$ G.</description>

      <title>Science Requirement Document (SRD) for the European Solar Telescope (EST) (3rd Edition, December 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.08650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) included the European Solar Telescope (EST) as an ESFRI Project in its 2016 Roadmap and confirmed this status in 2021. During the Preparatory Phase (2017 to 2022), the EST Science Advisory Group (SAG) was established in 2017. Its first task was to revise the Science Requirements Document (SRD), originally formulated in 2011. This second edition of the SRD was published in December 2019 (Schlichenmaier et al. 2019, 2019arXiv191208650S).
  Since 2019, the EST Project Office has advanced the telescope design and developed the Science Instrumentation Suite (SIS). All telescope subsystems and the SIS have now passed their Design Reviews. Aligned with the discussions and resolutions of the SAG, the SIS comprises three categories of first-generation instruments: (1) Tunable Imaging Spectropolarimeters coupled with Fixed Band Imagers (TIS/FBIs), employing large-aperture Fabry-P\'erot etalons; (2) Integral Field Spectropolarimeters based on microlens arrays (IFS-M); (3) The near-infrared spectropolarimeter EMBER (spectropolariMeter Based on slicEr-mirrors for the near-infraRed), using image-slicing technology. This configuration enables simultaneous observations of the same two-dimensional solar region across a broad wavelength range (380-2200 nm), giving EST a uniquely powerful multi-wavelength observing capability.
  This has made it necessary to revise the Observing Programmes so that they accurately reflect the capabilities of the SIS and ensure that all science objectives can be met. This third edition of the EST SRD integrates the outcomes of numerous SAG meetings held between 2020 and 2025 and incorporates all design developments up to 2025. It updates the Observing Programmes accordingly and assesses their alignment with the scientific objectives defined by the SAG.</description>

      <title>J-VAR: Analysis of RR Lyrae light curves in seven optical bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context:RR Lyrae stars, with their accurate period and amplitude measurements, constrain stellar evolution and map Galactic structure. The Javalambre VARiability (J-VAR) survey is the time-domain extension of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe survey, which provides time-series data across seven optical bands, including $gri$ and four medium and narrow bands. Aims: Our goal is to construct and analyze light curves for RR Lyrae stars identified in the J-VAR's first data release using the \textit{Gaia} third data release (DR3) Variable Stars catalog as a reference. Methods: The light curves of $315$ RR Lyrae were analyzed by fitting templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Multiband Template Library. The periods and amplitudes for the seven bands in J-VAR were independently obtained from the best-fitted templates. Results: The J-VAR periods show strong agreement with \textit{Gaia} DR3 values. The Bailey diagram for each J-VAR filter shows larger pulsation amplitudes at bluer wavelengths. Amplitudes, after normalizing by the $r$-band amplitude, show an exponential trend, with the bluer J-VAR filter centered at $395~\text{nm}$ having twice the amplitude of the reddest J-VAR passband at $861~\text{nm}$. The normalized amplitudes of the RR Lyrae stars from {\it Gaia} and the Zwicky Transient Facility are consistent with the J-VAR trend. Finally, the SDSS templates derived from broadbands also provide a proper description for the medium and narrow band light curves. Conclusions: The J-VAR RR Lyrae catalog offers reliable pulsation parameters and light curves in seven optical filters, allowing the systematic study of amplitude trends from $395~\text{nm}$ to $860~\text{nm}$.</description>

      <title>Segmentation and Tracking of Eruptive Solar Phenomena with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar eruptive events are complex phenomena, which most often include coronal mass ejections (CME), CME-driven compressive and shock waves, flares, and filament eruptions. CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observational data has become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has recently required the development of software approaches for automated characterisation of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced Wavetrack - a general algorithmic method for smart characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features. The method, based on a-trous wavelet decomposition, intensity rankings and a set of filtering techniques, allows to simplify and automate image processing and feature tracking. Previously, we applied the method successfully to several types of remote solar observations. Here we present the natural evolution of this approach. We discuss various aspects of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques towards segmentation of high-dynamic range heliophysics observations. We trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image segmentation models using feature masks obtained from the Wavetrack code. We present results from pre-trained models for segmentation of solar eruptive features and demonstrate their performance on a set of CME events based on SDO/AIA instrument data.</description>

      <title>SN 2024aecx: a fast-evolving Type IIb supernova with a prominent shock-cooling peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric (typically 0.5$\sim$1 day) and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance (11.3$\pm$1.1 Mpc), metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. Nebular spectral modelling indicates a blueshifted O-rich clump moving toward observer, and the $[\text{OI}]/[\text{CaII}]$ line ratio suggests an intermediate-mass progenitor. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with $M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.04\pm{0.01} M_{\odot}$ and a low ejecta mass of$M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 1.55^{+0.18}_{-0.14} M_{\odot}$. And the nebular-phase spectra and light-curve modelling both suggest that it most likely originated from an intermediate-mass binary progenitor system. The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.</description>

      <title>Backtracking Bipolar Magnetic Regions to their emergence: Two groups and their implication in the tilt measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) that appear on the solar photosphere are surface manifestations of the Suns internal magnetic field. With modern observations and continuous data streams, the study of BMRs has moved from manual sunspot catalogs to automated detection and tracking methods. In this work, we present an additional module to the existing BMR tracking algorithm, AutoTAB, that focuses on identifying emerging signatures of BMRs. Specifically, for regions newly detected on the solar disk, this module backtracks the BMRs to their point of emergence. From a total of about 12,000 BMRs identified by AutoTAB, we successfully backtracked 3,080 cases. Within this backtracked sample, we find two distinct populations. One group shows the expected behavior of emerging regions, in which the magnetic flux increases significantly during the emerging phase. The other group consists of BMRs whose flux, however, does not exhibit substantial growth during their evolution, the instances where our algorithm fails to capture the initial emergence of the BMRs. We classify these as discarded BMRs and examine their statistical properties separately. Our analysis shows that these discarded BMRs do not display any preferred tilt angle distribution and do not show systematic latitudinal tilt dependence, in contrast to the trends typically associated with emerging BMRs. This indicates that including such regions in statistical studies of BMR properties can distort or mask the underlying physical characteristics. We therefore emphasise the importance of excluding the discarded population from the whole dataset when analysing the statistical behavior of BMRs.</description>

      <title>Eclipsing Stellar Flare on the Demon Star Algol Binary System Observed during the MAXI-NICER Follow-up Campaign in 2018</title>

Abstract: Algol is a well-known eclipsing binary hosting an active and variable star that exhibits frequent stellar flares. Here, we report our pre-planned and coordinated rapid X-ray follow-up observations of an eclipsing flare on Algol. The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected a flare on Algol at 05:52 UT on 2018 July 4. Subsequently, we carried out a prompt X-ray monitoring with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) starting at 19:45 UT on the same day, and the observation ended at 06:02 UT on 2018 July 6. During the decaying phase of the flare, we successfully detected a 5.8-hour-long eclipse, corresponding to the secondary eclipse in which Algol A blocks the line of sight to Algol B. During the eclipse, the 2-10 keV X-ray flux is decreased to 20% level from $1.9\times10^{-10}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$ to $4.5\times10^{-11}~ \mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1} }$. We found a configuration of the flare size and location to explain the X-ray observations; e.g., the flare occurred at the latitude 45{\deg}S of the Algol B surface with a flare height of $1.9\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}$, corresponding to 0.8 times the stellar radius of Algol B, giving 80% obscuration of the flare loop by Algol A. The apparent absorption increase before the eclipse might originate from coronal mass ejection (CME) in the line of sight ejected during the flare.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of a Main Sequence G-Star Astrosphere Using Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report resolution of a halo of X-ray line emission surrounding the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) G8.5V star HD 61005 by Chandra ACIS-S. Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).</description>

      <title>Stellar properties and chemical features of the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars observed by GALAH DR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS) comprises approximately 330 000 stars within 100 pc of the Sun, as observed by Gaia data release 3 (Gaia DR3). Meanwhile, the GALAH DR4 survey has spectroscopically characterised nearly one million stars, delivering detailed chemical abundances (up to 30 elements). We present a joint analysis of the $\sim$ 6 000 stars common to both catalogues, offering initial insights into the stellar and chemical properties of the solar neighborhood. Our preliminary results indicate that the majority of these stars are FGK main-sequence objects, with some A-type interlopers (with effective temperatures ranging between 3 000 and 8 000 K), with median ages of $\sim$ 1.6 Gyr (ranging from 0.10 to 14.79 Gyr), and metal-poorer when compared to the Sun: [Fe/H] $\approx$ -0.19 dex. Additionally, most of the stars are disc members, with some local halo (high-velocity) stars identified. Building on this foundation, future work will deeper exploit the full spectroscopic information and orbital parameters from value-added catalogues to refine Galactic component classifications (thin-thick disc versus halo membership), perform detailed chemical profiling, and deliver a comprehensive chemo-dynamical characterisation of the solar neighborhood. This will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of nearby stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Binary Black Hole Mergers: Spin and mass ratio effects on gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive parameter-space study of binary black hole (BBH) mergers using the SEOBNRv4\_opt waveform model. Our analysis spans $\sim 10^6$ simulated waveforms across a broad range of mass ratios \( q = \frac{m_1}{m_2} \in [1.0, 2.0] \) and aligned spin configurations. We investigate the influence of these parameters on remnant properties, including final spin ($\chi_f$), fractional mass loss ($M_{\mathrm{FL}}$), and peak gravitational-wave strain ($h_{\max}$). By systematically analyzing the trends across four distinct spin alignments (PP, PN, BP, BN), we identify non-monotonic behaviors and turning points in $M_{\mathrm{FL}}$ and $\chi_f$ as functions of $q$, highlighting subtle dynamical effects that are not explicitly emphasized in commonly used remnant fitting formulae. While confirming known correlations from numerical relativity, our results offer new insights into parameter interactions and waveform morphology, with implications for BBH population studies and remnant characterization. Across all configurations studied, the fractional mass loss due to gravitational-wave emission ranges between 2\% and 9.5\%, depending on the mass ratio and spin alignment. This work may also aid in understanding the spin and mass distributions of the more massive black holes formed post-merger, thereby contributing to future remnant-based astrophysical inference.</description>

      <title>Linear map-making with LuSEE-Night</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LuSEE-Night is a pathfinder radio telescope on the lunar far side employing four 3-m monopole antennas arranged as two horizontal cross pseudo-dipoles on a rotational stage and sensitive to the radio sky in the 1-50 MHz frequency band. LuSEE-Night measures the corresponding 16 correlation products as a function of frequency. While each antenna combination measures radiation coming from a large area of the sky, their aggregate information as a function of phase in the lunar cycle and rotational stage position can be deconvolved into a low-resolution map of the sky. We study this deconvolution using linear map-making based on the Wiener filter algorithm. We illustrate how systematic effects can be effectively marginalised over as contributions to the noise covariance and demonstrate this technique on beam knowledge uncertainty and gain fluctuations. With reasonable assumptions about instrument performance, we show that LuSEE-Night should be able to map the sub-50 MHz sky at a ~5-degree resolution.</description>
