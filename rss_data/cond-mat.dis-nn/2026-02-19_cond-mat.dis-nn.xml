      <title>Optimizing p-spin models through hypergraph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: p-spin glasses, characterized by frustrated many-body interactions beyond the conventional pairwise case (p&gt;2), are prototypical disordered systems whose ground-state search is NP-hard and computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>KPZ-like transport in long-range interacting spin chains proximate to integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isotropic integrable spin chains such as the Heisenberg model feature superdiffusive spin transport belonging to an as-yet-unidentified dynamical universality class closely related to that of Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang (KPZ). To determine whether these results extend to more generic one-dimensional models, particularly those realizable in quantum simulators, we investigate spin and energy transport in non-integrable, long-range Heisenberg models using state-of-the-art tensor network methods. Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges. Finally, we consider anisotropic spin models naturally realized in Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules, demonstrating that a wide range of long-lived, non-diffusive transport can be observed in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Non-local physics-informed neural networks for forward and inverse solutions of granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense granular flows exhibit nonlocal effects due to stress transmission in microplastic events, especially in quasi-static or slowly sheared regions. Hence, traditional local rheological models fail to capture spatial cooperativity effects that are prominent in many granular systems. The nonlocal granular fluidity (NGF) model addresses this limitation by introducing a diffusive-like partial differential equation for a fluidity field, governed by a key material-dependent parameter: the nonlocal amplitude A. However, determining A from experiments or simulations is known to be difficult and typically requires extensive calibration across multiple geometries. In this work, we present a data-driven platform based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embedded with the NGF model, capable of solving granular flows in a forward or inverse manner. We show that once trained on transient flow fields, these non-local PINNs can readily infer the material parameters, as well as the pressure and stress fields. These data-driven frameworks allow for accurate recovery of small variations in the nonlocal amplitude, A, which lead to sharp bifurcation-like transitions in the flow field. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven parameter inference in complex nonlocal models and opens up new possibilities for characterizing granular materials from sparse experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Hidden universality in dislocation-loops mediated three-dimensional crystal melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding why and how crystalline solids melt remains a central problem in condensed-matter physics. Dislocation loops are fundamental topological excitations that control the thermodynamic stability of crystals, yet their role in setting universal aspects of melting has remained unclear. Here we show, within dislocation-mediated melting theory, that the free-energy condition for loop proliferation leads to a universal ratio between the energy of a minimal dislocation loop and the thermal energy at melting. For minimal dislocation loops that begin to proliferate at the onset of melting, this ratio takes the purely geometric value $\mathcal{E}_* = E_{\rm loop}/(k_B T_m) \approx 25.1$, independent of elastic moduli and chemistry-dependent details. This result provides a microscopic explanation for recent empirical findings by Lunkenheimer \emph{et al.}, who identified a closely related universal energy scale $\approx 24.6$ from viscosity data. The same framework also rationalizes the empirical $2/3$ rule relating the glass-transition and melting temperatures.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A view from Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26920v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.</description>

      <title>Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, i.e., the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a stylized model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Furthermore, our results underscore that a proper balance between neutral and non-neutral mutations is needed for the emergence of functional bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T&gt; n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta&gt;0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Spins: Statistical mechanics for error correction with stabilizer circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful method for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes is to map them onto classical statistical mechanics models. Such mappings have thus far mostly focused on static codes, possibly subject to repeated syndrome measurements. Recent progress in quantum error correction, however, has prompted new paradigms where codes emerge from stabilizer circuits in spacetime -- a unifying perspective encompassing syndrome extraction circuits of static codes, dynamically generated codes, and logical operations. We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds. Our framework offers a universal prescription to analyze, simulate, and compare the decoding properties of any stabilizer circuit, while revealing the innate connections between dynamical quantum systems and noise-resilient phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\,\mathrm{MeV}\le T_{\mathrm{loc}}\le 158\,\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.</description>
