      <title>Efficient electron heating by laser in finite sized plasma micro-globular targets by repeated collisions of surface and bulk waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new mechanism of enhanced laser energy absorption in plasma microglobules is demonstrated with the help of two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations. The mechanism relies on the excitation of surface and bulk waves and the occurrence of repeated collisions in the confines of the finite-sized microglobular target. The episodic increase in the average particle energy correlates with the repeated collision of the surface and bulk waves that get excited by the laser on the target. It is shown that the size of the microglobular target governs the efficiency of absorption and the timings of episodic events of energy enhancement. This study thereby illustrates the novel efficient possibility that a closed plasma target provides for energy extraction. Parallels of such colliding waves creating havoc in terms of wave breaking etc. can be witnessed on the ocean surface, seismic disturbances traversing as body waves traverse reflecting and refracting in the interior of the Earth along with surface waves (propagating on the curved surface of the Earth) converge at the antipode to create destruction. Our studies here show the importance of choosing closed targets which aid in the process of repeated energy transfer to particles and often their thermalization. The waves keep propagating in the closed confines rather than getting dissipated over an extended region as would happen for extended targets.</description>

      <title>Constraining the inner boundaries of COCONUT through plasma \b{eta} and Alfv\'en speed</title>

Abstract: Space weather modelling has been gaining importance due to our increasing dependency on technology sensitive to space weather effects, such as satellite services, air traffic and power grids. Improving the reliability, accuracy and numerical performance of space weather modelling tools, including global coronal models, is essential to develop timely and accurate forecasts and to help partly mitigate the space weather threat. Global corona models, however, require accurate boundary conditions, for the formulations of which we have very limited observational data. Unsuitable boundary condition prescriptions may lead to inconsistent features in the solution flow field and spoil the code's accuracy and performance. In this paper, we develop an adjustment to the inner boundary condition of the COCONUT global corona model to better capture the dynamics over and around the regions of stronger magnetic fields by constraining the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed. Using data from solar observations and solar atmospheric modelling codes such as Bifrost, we find that the baseline homogeneous boundary condition formulations for pressure and density do not capture the plasma conditions physically accurately. We develop a method to adjust these prescribed pressure and density values by placing constraints on the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed that act as proxies. We demonstrate that we can remove inexplicable fast streams from the solution by constraining the maximum Alfv\'en speed and the minimum plasma \b{eta} on the boundary surface. We also show that the magnetic topology is not significantly affected by this treatment otherwise. The presented technique shows the potential to ease the modelling of solar maxima, especially removing inexplicable features while, at the same time, not significantly affecting the magnetic field topology around the affected regions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux emergence and solar eruptions in partially ionized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed 3D MHD simulations to study the effect of partial ionization in the process of magnetic flux emergence in the Sun. In fact, we continue previous work and we now focus: 1) on the emergence of the magnetic fields above the solar photosphere and 2) on the eruptive activity, which follows the emergence into the corona. We find that in the simulations with partial ionization (PI), the structure of the emerging field consists of arch-like fieldlines with very little twist since the axis of the initial rising field remains below the photosphere. The plasma inside the emerging volume is less dense and it is moving faster compared to the fully ionized (FI) simulation. In both cases, new flux ropes (FR) are formed due to reconnection between emerging fieldlines, and they eventually erupt in an ejective manner towards the outer solar atmosphere. We are witnessing three major eruptions in both simulations. At least for the first eruption, the formation of the eruptive FR occurs in the low atmosphere in the FI case and at coronal heights in the PI case. Also, in the first PI eruption, part of the eruptive FR carries neutrals in the high atmosphere, for a short period of time. Overall, the eruptions are relatively faster in the PI case, while a considerable amount of axial flux is found above the photosphere during the eruptions in both simulations.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of relativistic axionically active plasma in the field of dynamic aether. Part I: General formalism and new concept of equilibrium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an extended version of the kinetic theory of the relativistic axionically active multi-component plasma, which is based on the inclusion of a unit time-like vector field, associated with the velocity of dynamic aether, into the scheme of interactions. The proposed extension of the plasma theory can be indicated as semi-phenomenological. This term means that master equations for the gravitational, electromagnetic, pseudoscalar (axionic) and vector (aetheric) fields are derived using the Lagrange formalism, the kinetic equations for the distribution functions are obtained by the methods of the covariant statistics, however, the relativistic forces acting from the listed fields on the plasma particles are reconstructed phenomenologically based on classical analogies. We consider this work as a first part of a trilogy; here we presented, first, the complete formalism of this extended theory, second, the classification of forces, third, the new concept of equilibrium states in the relativistic axionically - aetherically active plasma.</description>

      <title>Collisionless zonal-flow dynamics in quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear collisionless plasma response to a zonal-density perturbation in quasisymmetric stellarators is studied, including the geodesic-acoustic-mode oscillations and the Rosenbluth--Hinton residual flow. While the geodesic-acoustic-mode oscillations in quasiaxisymmetric configurations are similar to tokamaks, they become non-existent in quasi-helically symmetric configurations when the effective safety factor in helical-angle coordinates is small. Compared with concentric circular tokamaks, the Rosenbluth--Hinton residual is also found to be multiplied by a geometric factor $\mathcal{C}$ that arises from the flux-surface averaged classical polarization. Using the near-axis-expansion framework, we derive an analytic expression for $\mathcal{C}$, which varies significantly among different configurations. These analytic results are compared with numerical simulation results from the global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code GTC, and good agreement with the theoretical Rosenbluth--Hinton residual level is achieved only when the quasisymmetry error is small enough. Since zonal flows can be important for regulating turbulent transport, these results suggest a possible relation between the transport level and the stellarator geometric parameters via nonlinear interactions with zonal flows.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ion Mobility on Electron Density and Temperature in Hypersonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of how ion mobility affects electron density and temperature in hypersonic flows. We compare two ion mobility models: one derived from Gupta-Yos cross-sections, and the other from swarm drift velocity experiments. The ion mobility model significantly alters the plasma density around a hypersonic waverider, with increases of more than twofold observed at low dynamic pressures and high Mach numbers. This is partly due to electron loss through surface catalysis, which depends on ambipolar diffusion scaling with ion mobility. We also derive novel scaling laws that highlight the strong dependence of electron cooling on ion mobility both within the quasi-neutral regions and the non-neutral plasma sheaths. Electron cooling influences the electron temperature across the plasma, leading to a previously unrecognized impact of ion mobility on plasma bulk temperature. This in turn affects plasma density via electron-ion recombination rates which are temperature-dependent. Accurately modeling ion mobility is critical for predicting hypersonic plasma behavior, with important implications for optimizing magnetohydrodynamic technologies and mitigating or exploiting plasma-induced interference with electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of two magnetized counter-propagating weakly collisional plasma flows in arch configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of the interaction process of two counter-streaming supersonic plasma flows with an arched magnetic field configuration in the regime of a magnetic Mach number of the order of unity $M_m \sim 1$ is carried out. The flows were launched from the bases of the arch along the direction of the magnetic field. It is shown that the interaction has non-equilibrium and non-stationary nature. It is accompanied by an expansion of the resulting magnetic plasma arch due to $E \times B$ drift with the formation of a region with oppositely directed magnetic fields, in which magnetic reconnection is observed. In the subcritical regime Mm &lt; 1 the reconnection process is slow, and in the overcritical one Mm &gt; 1 it is more intense and leads to plasma turbulization. Filamentation of flows due to the development of Weibel instability, as well as excitation of surface waves near the ion-cyclotron frequency on the surface of the plasma tube are also observed. The modeling was carried out for the parameters of an experiment planned for the near future, which made it possible to formulate the conditions for observing the effects discovered in the modeling.</description>
