      <title>Neural Network Analysis of S2-Star Dynamics: Extended mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural network (PINN) analysis of the dynamics of S-stars in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center is performed within General Relativity treatment. The aim is to reveal the role of possible extended mass (dark matter) configuration in the dynamics of the S-stars, in addition to the dominating central black hole's mass. The PINN training fails to detect the extended mass perturbation in the observational data for S2 star within the existing data accuracy, and the precession constraint indicates no signature of extended mass up to 0.01% of the central mass inside the apocenter of S2. Neural networks analysis thus confirm its efficiency in the analysis of the S-star dynamics.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant from the $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ and $\textrm{M87}^\star$ shadow prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) achieved the realization of an image of the supermassive black hole $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ showing an angular shadow diameter $\mathcal{D}= 48.7 \pm 7\mu as$ and the fractional deviation $\mathbf{\delta} = -0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.09}~\text{(VLTI)},-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~\text{(Keck)}$, alongside the earlier image of $\textrm{M87}^\star$ with angular diameter $ \mathcal{D}=42 \pm 3 \mu as$, deviation $\mathbf{\delta}=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and deviations from circularity estimated to be $\Delta \mathcal{C}\lesssim 10\%$. In addition, the shadow radii are assessed within the ranges $3.38 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 6.91$ for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $3.85 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.72$ as well as $3.95 \le \frac{r_{\text{s}}}{M} \le 5.92$ for $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and Keck observatories, respectively. These values are provided with $1$-$\sigma$ and $2$-$\sigma$ measurements. Such realizations can unveil a better comprehension of gravitational physics at the horizon scale. In this paper, we use the EHT observational results for $\textrm{M87}^\star$ and $\textrm{Sgr~A}^\star$ to elaborate the constraints on parameters of accelerating black holes with a cosmological constant. Concretely, we utilize the mass and distance of both black holes to derive the observables associated with the accelerating black hole shadow. First, we compare our findings with observed quantities such as angular diameter, circularity, shadow radius, and the fractional deviation from the $\textrm{M87}^\star$ data. This comparison reveals constraints within the acceleration parameter and the cosmological constant...
  Lastly, one cannot rule out the possibility of the negative values for the cosmological constant on the emergence of accelerated black hole solutions within the context of minimal gauged supergravity...</description>

      <title>Accelerating AdS black holes in gravity's rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the effect of the energy of moving particles in $C-$metric, we first obtain exact accelerating black hole solutions in gravity's rainbow. Then, we study the effects of gravity's rainbow and $C-$metric parameters on the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, and also the asymptotical behavior of this solution. Next, we indicate how different parameters of the obtained accelerating black holes in gravity's rainbow affect thermodynamics quantities (such as the Hawking temperature, and entropy) and the local stability (by evaluating the heat capacity). In the following, we extract the geodesic equations to determine the effects of various parameters on photon trajectory in the vicinity of this black hole, as well as obtain the radius of the photon sphere and the corresponding critical impact parameter to gain insight into AdS black hole physics by adding the gravity's rainbow to $C-$metric.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear quasinormal mode detectability with next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the aftermath of a binary black hole merger event, the gravitational wave signal emitted by the remnant black hole is modeled as a superposition of damped sinusoids known as quasinormal modes. While the dominant quasinormal modes originating from linear black hole perturbation theory have been studied extensively in this post-merger "ringdown" phase, more accurate models of ringdown radiation include the nonlinear modes arising from higher-order perturbations of the remnant black hole spacetime. We explore the detectability of quadratic quasinormal modes with both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. We quantify how predictions of the quadratic mode detectability depend on the quasinormal mode starting times. We then calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of quadratic modes for several detectors and binary black hole populations, focusing on the ($220\times220$) mode - i.e., on the quadratic term sourced by the square of the linear $(220)$ mode. For the events with the loudest quadratic mode signal-to-noise ratios, we additionally compute statistical errors on the mode parameters in order to further ascertain the distinguishability of the quadratic mode from the linear quasinormal modes. The astrophysical models used in this paper suggest that while the quadratic mode may be detectable in at most a few events with ground-based detectors, the prospects for detection with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are more optimistic.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Barrow-Tsallis Cosmology in Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the Barrow and Tsallis $\delta$ entropies are one-parameter generalizations of the black-hole entropy, with the same microcanonical functional form. The ensuing deformation is quantified by a dimensionless parameter $\Delta$, which in the case of Barrow entropy represents the anomalous dimension, while in Tsallis' case, it describes the deviation of the holographic scaling from extensivity. Here, we utilize the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture with the Barrow--Tsallis entropy to investigate the implications of the related modified Friedmann equations on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. We show that, with the experimental sensitivity of the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, such as the Big Bang Observer, it will be possible to discriminate deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model up to $\Delta\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background generated by domain wall networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the power spectrum of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background produced by standard and biased domain wall networks, using the Velocity-dependent One-Scale model to compute the cosmological evolution of their characteristic scale and root-mean-squared velocity. We consider a standard radiation + $\Lambda \rm CDM$ background and assume that a constant fraction of the energy of collapsing domain walls is emitted in the form of gravitational waves. We show that, in an expanding background, the total energy density in gravitational radiation decreases with cosmic time (after a short initial period of quick growth). We also propose a two parameter model for the scale-dependence of the frequency distribution of the gravitational waves emitted by collapsing domain walls. We determine the corresponding power spectrum of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background generated by domain walls, showing that it is a monotonic decreasing function of the frequency for frequencies larger than that of the peak generated by the walls that have decayed most recently. We also develop an analytical approximation to this spectrum, assuming perfect linear scaling during both the radiation and matter eras, in order to characterize the dependence of the amplitude, peak frequency and slope of the power spectrum on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Axionic Static Neutron Stars with Masses in the Mass-Gap Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider an axionic scalar-tensor theory of gravity and its effects on static neutron stars. The axionic theory is considered in the regime in which the axion oscillates around its potential minimum, which cosmologically occurs post-inflationary, when the Hubble rate is of the same order as the axion mass. We construct the TOV equations for this axionic theory and for a spherically symmetric static spacetime and we solve these numerically using a quite robust double shooting LSODA based python integration method. Regarding the equations of state, we used nine mainstream and quite popular ones, namely, the WFF1, the SLy, the APR, the MS1, the AP3, the AP4, the ENG, the MPA1 and the MS1b, using the piecewise polytropic description for each. From the extracted data we calculate the Jordan frame masses and radii, and we confront the resulting phenomenology with five well-known neutron star constraints. As we demonstrate, the AP3, the ENG and the MPA1 equations of state yield phenomenologically viable results which are compatible with the constraints, with the MPA1 equation of state enjoying an elevated role among the three. The reason is that the MPA1 fits well the phenomenological constraints. A mentionable feature is the fact that all the viable phenomenologically equations of state produce maximum masses which are in the mass-gap region with $M_{max}&gt;2.5M_{\odot}$, but lower that the causal 3 solar masses limit. We also compare the neutron star phenomenology produced by the axionic scalar-tensor theory with the phenomenology produced by inflationary attractors scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Gravitating Cylindrical Structures in Modified Gravity: Insights from Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>

      <title>Constraining modified gravity models through strong lensing cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze cosmography as a tool to constrain modified gravity theories. We take four distinct models and obtain their parameters in terms of the cosmographic parameters favored by observational data of strong gravitational lensing. We contrast with the values obtained by direct comparison between each model and the observational data. In general, we find consistency between the two approaches at 2$\sigma$ for all models considered in this work. Our study bridges the gap between theoretical predictions of modified gravity and empirical observations of strong gravitational lensing, providing a simple methodology to test the validity of these models.</description>

      <title>Probing Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity: Cosmological implications and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cosmological implications and constraints of Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity. This theory introduces a coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor, using the principles of proper Weyl geometry. In this geometry, the scalar non-metricity $Q$, which characterizes the deviations from Riemannian geometry, is expressed in its standard Weyl form $\nabla _{\mu }g_{\alpha \beta }=-w_{\mu }g_{\alpha \beta }$ and is determined by a vector field $w_{\mu }$. To study the implications of this theory, we propose a deceleration parameter with a single unknown parameter $\chi$, which we constrain by using the latest cosmological data. By solving the field equations derived from Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity, we aim to understand the behavior of the energy conditions within this framework. In the present work, we consider two well-motivated forms of the function $f(Q, T)$: (i) the linear model represented by $f(Q, T) = \alpha Q + \frac{\beta}{6\kappa^2} T$, and (ii) the coupling model represented by $f(Q, T) = \frac{\gamma}{6H_0^2 \kappa^2} QT$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are free parameters. Here, $\kappa^2 = \frac{1}{16\pi G}$ represents the gravitational coupling constant. In both of the models considered, the strong energy condition is violated, indicating consistency with the present accelerated expansion. However, the null, weak, and dominant energy conditions are satisfied in these models.</description>

      <title>Force-free Electromagnetic Configurations in FLRW Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Force-free electrodynamics is the theoretical paradigm used to describe electromagnetic fields in a region where the inertia of plasma is negligible compared to the strength of the electromagnetic field. While these fields are studied extensively around accreting black holes in an attempt to describe energy extraction, force-free fields also routinely appear in the study of cosmological magnetic fields. Despite this, there are no systematic studies of exact force-free fields in an expanding universe. In this paper, we use geometric methods to find a wide variety of force-free solutions in a fixed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric background. The method we use can be directly generalized to any arbitrary electrically neutral space-time, and hence, provides a powerful tool to study force-free fields in general.</description>

      <title>Angular and radial stabilities of spontaneously scalarized black holes in the presence of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of spontaneously scalarized black holes (BHs) induced by a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant $R_{\rm GB}^2$. For the scalar-GB coupling $\xi(\phi)=(\eta/8) (\phi^2+\alpha \phi^4)$, where $\eta$ and $\alpha$ are constants, we first show that there are no angular Laplacian instabilities of even-parity perturbations far away from the horizon for large multipoles $l \gg 1$. The deviation of angular propagation speeds from the speed of light is largest on the horizon, whose property can be used to put constraints on the model parameters. For $\alpha \gtrsim -1$, the region in which the scalarized BH is subject to angular Laplacian instabilities can emerge. Provided that $\alpha \lesssim -1$ and $-1/2&lt;\alpha \phi_0^2&lt;-0.1155$, where $\phi_0$ is the field value on the horizon with a unit of the reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}=1$, there are scalarized BH solutions satisfying all the linear stability conditions throughout the horizon exterior. We also study the stability of spontaneously scalarized BHs in scalar-GB theories with a nonminimal coupling $-\beta \phi^2 R/16$, where $\beta$ is a positive constant and $R$ is a Ricci scalar. As the amplitude of the field on the horizon approaches an upper limit $|\phi_0|=4/\sqrt{\beta}$, one of the squared angular propagation speeds $c_{\Omega-}^2$ enters the instability region $c_{\Omega-}^2&lt;0$. So long as $|\phi_0|$ is smaller than a maximum value determined for each $\beta$ in the range $\beta&gt;5$, however, the scalarized BHs are linearly stable in both angular and radial directions.</description>

      <title>Analytical perturbations of relativistic images in Kerr space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light rays passing very close to black holes may wind several times before escaping. For any given electromagnetic source around the black hole, a distant observer would thus observe two infinite sequences of images on either side of the black hole. These images are generated by light rays performing an increasing numbers of loops. The strong deflection limit provides a simple analytic formalism to describe such higher order images for spherically symmetric metrics, while for axially symmetric black holes one typically resorts to numerical approaches. Here we present the leading order perturbation to higher order images when the black hole spin is turned on. We show that the images slide around the black hole shadow as an effect of space-time dragging. We derive analytical formulae for their shifts and the perturbation of their time delays. We also discuss how such simple analytical formulae for images by Kerr black holes can be of great help in many applications.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic particle production scenario in algebraically coupled quintessence field with dark matter fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an algebraically coupled quintessence field with a dark matter fluid, considering a scenario involving non-adiabatic particle production, through the action principle by modifying the interaction Lagrangian. The interaction parameter serves as the source of dark matter particle and entropy production. As particle creation occurs due to the interaction between the field and fluid sectors, the system manifests an additional pressure. Our analysis includes studying the system's dynamics by considering an exponential type of interaction corresponding to the field's exponential potential. We find that the system exhibits phantom behavior at the current epoch before stabilizing in the accelerating future epoch of the universe.</description>

      <title>Spatial Dependence of the Growth Factor in Scalar-Tensor Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have taken on a key role in attempts to confront the growing open questions in standard cosmology. It is important to understand entirely their dynamics at perturbative level including any possible spatial dependence in their growth of large scale structures. In this work, we investigate the spatial dependence of the growth rate of scalar-tensor theories through the M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros equation. We confirm that at subhorizon level this dependence does not play a major role for viable models. However, we establish conditions on which this criterion is met which may be important for developing new models. In our work, we consider three specific models that exhibit spatial dependence of the growth rate at superhorizon modes, which may also be important for early Universe models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing post-Newtonian parameters and fixing the BMS frame for numerical-relativity waveform hybridizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black holes provide precise waveforms, but are typically too computationally expensive to produce waveforms with enough orbits to cover the whole frequency band of gravitational-wave observatories. Accordingly, it is important to be able to hybridize NR waveforms with analytic, post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, which are accurate during the early inspiral phase. We show that to build such hybrids, it is crucial to both fix the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the NR waveforms to match that of PN theory, and optimize over the PN parameters. We test such a hybridization procedure including all spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes with $|m|\leq \ell$ for $\ell\leq 8$, using 29 NR waveforms with mass ratios $q\leq 10$ and spin magnitudes $|\chi_1|, |\chi_2|\leq 0.8$. We find that for spin-aligned systems, the PN and NR waveforms agree very well. The difference is limited by the small nonzero orbital eccentricity of the NR waveforms, or equivalently by the lack of eccentric terms in the PN waveforms. To maintain full accuracy of the simulations, the matching window for spin-aligned systems should be at least 5 orbits long and end at least 15 orbits before merger. For precessing systems, the errors are larger than for spin-aligned cases. The errors are likely limited by the absence of precession-related spin-spin PN terms. Using $10^5\,M$ long NR waveforms, we find that there is no optimal choice of the matching window within this time span, because the hybridization result for precessing cases is always better if using earlier or longer matching windows. We provide the mean orbital frequency of the smallest acceptable matching window as a function of the target error between the PN and NR waveforms and the black hole spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, non perfect fluid, tilted source solutions in both Einstein-Hilbert General Relativity (GR) and Quadratic Gravity (QG) for the anisotropic Bianchi V model are addressed. Since the excellent CMBR match of Starobinsky's inflation with Planck's team measurements data, QG has acquired a prominent status in the effective sense, for sufficiently strong gravity fields. The main interest is in the numeric time evolution to the past towards the singularity and the behavior of the kinematic variables, vorticity, acceleration, and the expansion of this source substance. In QG we found that for universes with higher and smaller matter densities fall into the Kasner or isotropic singularity attractors to the past, respectively. We also found that the Kasner singularity attractor to the past has always zero vorticity, for both GR and QG theories. While for QG the isotropic singularity attractor may have divergent vorticity. For the set of assumptions and conditions supposed in this work, the isotropic singularity attractor, favors QG as compared to GR. Only in QG we were able to find a geometric singularity with divergences in all of the kinematic variables of the substance, decreasing to finite values to the future, upon time reversing. That is, we obtained an initial kinematic singularity substance, that approaches a perfect fluid source.</description>

      <title>Optimized Search for a Binary Black Hole Merger Population in LIGO-Virgo O3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximizing the number of detections in matched filter searches for compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational wave (GW) signals requires a model of the source population distribution. In previous searches using the PyCBC framework, sensitivity to the population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers was improved by restricting the range of filter template mass ratios and use of a simple one-dimensional population model. However, this approach does not make use of our full knowledge of the population and cannot be extended to a full parameter space search. Here, we introduce a new ranking method, based on kernel density estimation (KDE) with adaptive bandwidth, to accurately model the probability distributions of binary source parameters over a template bank, both for signals and for noise events. We demonstrate this ranking method by conducting a search over LIGO-Virgo O3 data for BBH with unrestricted mass ratio, using a signal model derived from previous significant detected events. We achieve over 10% increase in sensitive volume for a simple power-law simulated signal population, compared to the previous BBH search. Correspondingly, with the new ranking, 8 additional candidate events above an inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) threshold 0.5 yr are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider self-interacting scalar fields with a conformal coupling in the dS background and study the quantum corrections from bubble loop diagrams. Incorporating the perturbative in-in formalism, we calculate the quantum corrections in the vacuum zero point energy and pressure of self-interacting fields with the potential $V \propto \Phi^n $ for even values of $n$. We calculate the equation of state corresponding to these quantum corrections and examine the scaling of the divergent terms in the vacuum zero point energy and pressure associated to the dimensional regularization scheme. In particular, we show that for quartic self-interacting scalar field the conformal invariance is respected at two-loop order at the conformal point.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating Higgs field of scalar charge. II. Asymmetric scalar doublet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-gravitating Higgs field of a scalar charge is studied for the case of an asymmetric scalar doublet containing, along with a canonical and a phantom component. It is shown that in the zero and first approximation of the smallness of the canonical and phantom scalar charges, the gravitational field of the scalar charge is described by the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric with a cosmological constant determined by the stable equilibrium point - the vacuum potential of the canonical Higgs field and the zero value of the scalar potential. An equation for the perturbation of the stable value of the potential is obtained and studied, and the asymptotic behavior in the near and far zones is found. The averaging of microscopic oscillations of the scalar field is carried out and it is shown that the sign of the contribution of microscopic oscillations to the macroscopic energy of the scalar field is completely determined by the values of the fundamental constants of the Higgs potential of the asymmetric scalar doublet. Particular attention is paid to the case when the contribution of oscillations to the macroscopic energy and pressure densities is strictly equal to zero. Possible applications of the obtained solutions are discussed.
  Keywords: scalarly charged black hole, asymmetric scalar doublet, scalar Higgs field, asymptotic behavior, macroscopic characteristics, doublet orientation.</description>

      <title>Large Eddy Simulations of Magnetized Mergers of Black Holes and Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration has observed gravitational waves consistent with the mergers of a black hole and a neutron star, namely GW200105 and GW200115, providing evidence for such cataclysmic events. Although no electromagnetic counterpart was reported for either of these two events, under certain conditions black hole--neutron star mergers are expected to form a significant accretion disk and to produce both a short gamma ray burst and a kilonova, much as observed in the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Here, we extend our publicly available code \mhduet to study numerically the merger of a magnetized neutron star with a black hole. \mhduet employs Large Eddy Simulation techniques to help capture the magnetic field amplification resulting from turbulence and other sub-grid scale dynamics in the post-merger stage. In particular, we simulate a merger with parameters favorable to producing an accretion disk, focusing on the formation and dynamics of the turbulent disk and the resulting magnetic field amplification. Following the tidal disruption and during the formation of the accretion disk, the magnetic field undergoes significant amplification driven by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, reaching strengths of more than $10^{14}\,\rm{G}$ from a realistic initial strength of $10^{11}\,\rm{G}$ in short timescales of approximately $20\,\rm{ms}$. At later times in our simulations the magnetic field growth occurs at larger scales and is dominated mainly by magnetic winding.</description>

      <title>Consistent extinction model for type Ia supernovae in Cepheid-based calibration galaxies and its impact on $H_{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most recent SH0ES measurement of the Hubble constant, based on type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ compilation, employs corrections of supernova peak magnitudes which effectively accounts for extinction in the supernova host galaxies. These corrections are estimated using a probabilistic model which is trained on Hubble flow (z&gt;0.03) supernovae and extrapolated to the calibration galaxies (those with observed Cepheid distances). By comparing the corrected peak magnitudes to distance moduli from Cepheids, we show that this standard approach underestimates the brightness of reddened supernovae in the high stellar-mass ($M_{\star}&gt;10^{10}M_{\odot}$) calibration galaxies. This can be traced back to the fact that for these galaxies, a low total-to-selective extinction coefficient (R_B~3) is assumed, while for the low stellar-mass analogues a more standard R_B~4 is assumed. We propose a minimalistic modification of the Pantheon+ extinction model in order to alleviate this systematic effect. The modification is twofold and it involves: (i) the same, Milky Way-like distribution of R_B in all calibration galaxies (with mean R_B of 4.3 -- consistent with the extinction curve used for colour corrections of the Cepheids -- and scatter 0.4) and (ii) a modified shape of the E(B-V) reddening distribution while keeping the same effective slope of the supernova peak magnitude-colour relation and the same mean E(B-V) reddening as measured for supernovae in the Hubble flow. We show that this new approach yields a significantly better fit ($\Delta$BIC=-11) to the calibration data and results in a lower value of the derived Hubble constant through a stronger extinction correction of supernovae in the calibration galaxies. Our result is $H_{0}=70.5\pm1$ km/s/Mpc implying a reduction of the tension with the Planck $H_{0}$ measurement assuming a flat LCDM cosmology from $5.2\sigma$ to $2.8\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Inflationary non-Gaussianities in alpha vacua and consistency with conformal symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conformal invariance of inflationary non-Gaussianities associated with scalar fluctuations in a non-Bunch-Davies initial state, known as the $\alpha$-vacuum, in single-field slow-roll inflation. The $\alpha$-vacuum is a one-parameter family of states, including the Bunch-Davies one, that preserves the conformal symmetry of inflationary dynamics in a nearly de-Sitter space-time. Working within the leading slow-roll approximation, we compute the four-point scalar correlator (the trispectrum) in $\alpha$-vacuum using the in-in formalism. We check that the conformal Ward identities are met between the three and four-point scalar $\alpha$-vacua correlators. Surprisingly, this contrasts the previously reported negative result of the Ward identities being violated between the two and the three-point correlators. We have also extended the wave-functional method, previously used for correlators with Bunch-Davies initial condition, to compute the three and four-point scalar correlators in $\alpha$-vacua. The results obtained from the wave-function method match the corresponding in-in results, adding further justification to our check of Ward identities with $\alpha$-vacua correlators.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy beyond Kerr: agnostic and theory-based tests with next-generation interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy is a clean and powerful tool to test gravity in the strong-field regime and to probe the nature of compact objects. Next-generation ground-based detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will observe thousands of binary black hole mergers with large signal-to-noise ratios, allowing for accurate measurements of the remnant black hole quasinormal mode frequencies and damping times. In previous work we developed an observable-based parametrization of the quasinormal mode spectrum of spinning black holes beyond general relativity (ParSpec). In this paper we use this parametrization to ask: can next-generation detectors detect or constrain deviations from the Kerr spectrum by stacking multiple observations of binary mergers from astrophysically motivated populations? We focus on two families of tests: (i) agnostic (null) tests, and (ii) theory-based tests, which make use of quasinormal frequency calculations in specific modified theories of gravity. We consider in particular two quadratic gravity theories (Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity) and various effective field theory-based extensions of general relativity. We find that robust inference of hypothetical corrections to general relativity requires pushing the slow-rotation expansion to high orders. Even when high-order expansions are available, ringdown observations alone may not be sufficient to measure deviations from the Kerr spectrum for theories with dimensionful coupling constants. This is because the constraints are dominated by "light" black hole remnants, and only few of them have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio in the ringdown. Black hole spectroscopy with next-generation detectors may be able to set tight constraints on theories with dimensionless coupling, as long as we assume prior knowledge of the mass and spin of the remnant black hole.</description>

Abstract: We report a new method to calculate the quasinormal modes of rotating black holes, using a spectral decomposition to solve the partial differential equations that result from introducing linear metric perturbations to a rotating background. Our approach allows us to calculate a large sector of the quasinormal mode spectrum. In particular, we study the accuracy of the method for the $(l=2)$-led and $(l=3)$-led modes for different values of the $M_z$ azimuthal number, considering the fundamental modes as well as the first two excitations. We show that our method reproduces the Kerr fundamental modes with an accuracy of $10^{-6}$ or better for $a/M&lt;0.8$, while it stays below $0.1\%$ for $a/M&lt;0.98$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study phase structures of Lorentzian Dyonic Taub-NUT-AdS spacetimes for different horizon geometries, which are spherical, flat, and hyperbolic. We check the consistency of our extended thermodynamics approach through satisfying the first law, the Gibbs-Duhem relation, and the generalized Smarr's relation. Although we study the phase structure for the three cases, we give special attention to the flat and hyperbolic cases since they are known to show no phase transitions and weren't studied before. Working in a mixed ensemble, we found that the behaviors of the flat and hyperbolic cases are different from those of a charged black hole. In the latter case, a continuous phase transition occurs at high temperatures and pressures, i.e., above the critical point, but in our cases it occurs at low temperatures and pressures, i.e., below the critical point! Generically, the spherical case is characterized by two critical points with continuous phase transition between them.</description>

      <title>Normal modes of Proca fields in AdS$_d$ spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The normal modes of Proca field perturbations in $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, AdS$_d$ for short, with reflective Dirichlet boundary conditions, are obtained exactly. Within the Ishibashi-Kodama framework, we decompose the Proca field in scalar-type and vector-type components, according to their tensorial behavior on the $(d-2)$-sphere $\mathcal{S}^{d-2}$. Two of the degrees of freedom of the Proca field are described by scalar-type components, which in general are coupled due to the mass of the field, but in AdS$_d$ we show that they can be decoupled. The other $d-3$ degrees of freedom of the field are described by a vector-type component that generically decouples completely. The normal modes and their frequencies for both the scalar-type and vector-type components of the Proca field are then obtained analytically. Additionally, we analyze the normal modes of the Maxwell field as the massless limit of the Proca field. We find that for scalar-type perturbations in $d=4$ there is a discontinuity in the massless limit, in $d=5$ the massless limit is well defined using Dirichlet-Neumann rather than Dirichlet boundary conditions, and in $d&gt;5$ the massless limit is completely well defined, i.e., it is obtained smoothly from the massless limit of the scalar-type perturbations of the Proca field. For vector-type perturbations the Maxwell field limit is obtained smoothly for all $d$ from the massless limit of the vector-type perturbations of the Proca field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute departures in the black hole thermodynamics induced by either geometric or topological corrections to general relativity. Specifically, we analyze the spherically symmetric spacetime solutions of two modified gravity scenarios with Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}\sim R^{1+\epsilon}$ and $\mathcal{L}\sim R+\epsilon\, \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Euler density in four dimensions, while $ 0&lt;\epsilon\ll 1$ measures the perturbation around the Hilbert-Einstein action. Accordingly, we find the expressions of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by the Penrose formula, and the black hole temperature and horizon of the obtained solutions. We then investigate the heat capacities in terms of the free parameters of the theories under study. In doing so, we show that healing the problem of negative heat capacities can be possible under particular choices of the free constants, albeit with limitations on the masses allowed for the black hole solutions.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight boson fields, with a mass around $10^{-23}\text{eV}$, are promising candidates for the elusive cosmological dark matter. These fields induce a periodic oscillation of the spacetime metric in the nanohertz frequency band, which is detectable by pulsar timing arrays. In this paper, we investigate the gravitational effect of ultralight tensor dark matter on the arrival time of radio pulses from pulsars. We find that the pulsar timing signal caused by tensor dark matter exhibits a different angular dependence than that by scalar and vector dark matter, making it possible to distinguish the ultralight dark matter signal with different spins. Combining the gravitational effect and the coupling effect of ultralight tensor dark matter with standard model matter provides a complementary way to constrain the coupling parameter $\alpha$. We estimate $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-6}\sim 10^{-5}$ in the mass range $m&lt;5\times 10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ with current pulsar timing array.</description>

Abstract: The landscape of six-dimensional supergravities is dramatically constrained by the cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies, but the full extent of its implications has not been uncovered. We explore the cancellation of global anomalies of the Dai-Freed type in this setting with abelian and simply laced gauge groups, finding novel constraints. In particular, we exclude arbitrarily large abelian charges in an infinite family of theories for certain types of quadratic refinements, including a specific one defined in the literature. We also show that the Gepner orientifold with no tensor multiplets is anomaly-free for a different choice, as well as a number of heterotic models with and without spacetime supersymmetry in six dimensions. The latter analysis extends previous results in ten dimensions to some lower-dimensional settings in the heterotic landscape.</description>

      <title>Conformally compact and higher conformal Yang-Mills equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On conformally compact manifolds we study Yang-Mills equations, their boundary conditions, formal asymptotics, and Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps. We find that smooth solutions with "magnetic" Dirichlet boundary data are obstructed by a conformally invariant, higher order boundary current. We study the asymptotics of the interior Yang-Mills energy functional and show that the obstructing current is the variation of the conformally invariant coefficient of the first log term in this expansion which is a higher derivative conformally invariant analog of the Yang-Mills energy. The invariant energy is the anomaly for the renormalized interior Yang-Mills functional and its variation gives higher conformal Yang-Mills equations. Global solutions to the magnetic boundary problem determine higher order "electric" Neumann data. This yields the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We also construct conformally invariant, higher transverse derivative boundary operators. Acting on interior connections, they give obstructions to solving the Yang-Mills boundary problem, determine the asymptotics of formal solutions, and yield conformally invariant tensors capturing the (non-local) electric Neumann data. We also characterize a renormalized Yang-Mills action functional that encodes global features analogously to the renormalized volume for Poincar\'e-Einstein structures.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravity Extruding Peaks in Speed of Sound Profiles of Massive Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speed of sound squared (SSS) $s^2$ in massive neutron stars (NSs) characterizes not only the stiffness of supradense neutron-rich matter within but also equivalently properties of the curved geometry due to the strong-field gravity and matter-geometry coupling. A peaked density or radius profile of $s^2$ has been predicted for massive NSs using various NS Equation of State (EOS) models. However, the nature, cause, location and size of the peak in $s^2$ profiles are still very EOS model dependent. In this work, we investigate systematically $s^2$ profiles in massive NSs in a new approach that is independent of the nuclear EOS model and without any presumption about the NS structure and/or composition. In terms of the small quantities (reduced radius, the energy density and pressure scaled by their central values), we perform double-element perturbative expansions in solving perturbatively the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and analyzing $s^2$ profiles from the Newtonian limit to the general relativistic (GR) case. The GR term in the TOV equations plays a twofold role: it compresses NS matter and modifies the pressure/energy density ratio from small values in Newtonian stars showing no $s^2$ peak to large ones for massive NSs possessing a peak in their $s^2$ profiles, and eventually takes away the peak in extremely compact/massive NSs approaching the causality limit. {In particular, the peaked behavior in $s^2$ is expected to emerge near the center of massive NSs like PSR J0740+6620, while a sharp phase transition is unlikely to occur there.} These features revealed from our analyses are universal as they are intrinsic properties of the GR stellar structure equations independent of the still very uncertain EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter in NSs.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter from inflation-driven quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to produce axion dark matter from inflationary fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations during inflation are strengthened by a coupling of the axion kinetic term to the inflaton, which we parametrize as an effective curvature $\kappa$ in the axion equation of motion. A nonvanishing curvature breaks the scale invariance of the axion power spectrum, driving a quantum phase transition with $\kappa$ as the order parameter. The axion power spectrum is proportional to the inverse comoving horizon to the power of $\kappa$. For positive $\kappa$ the spectrum gets a red tilt, leading to an exponential enhancement of the axion abundance as the comoving horizon shrinks during inflation. This enhancement allows sufficient axion production to comprise the entire dark matter relic abundance despite the ultralight mass. Our mechanism predicts a significantly different parameter space from the usual misalignment mechanism. It allows for axion-like particle dark matter with a much lower decay constant and thus a larger coupling to Standard Model particles. Much of the parameter space can be probed by future experiments including haloscopes, nuclear clocks, CASPEr, and CMB-S4. We can also generate heavier QCD axion dark matter than the misalignment mechanism.</description>
