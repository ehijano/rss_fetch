      <title>A Supervised Machine Learning Framework for Multipactor Breakdown Prediction in High-Power Radio Frequency Devices and Accelerator Components: A Case Study in Planar Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models - including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.</description>

      <title>Advanced Ceramic Plasma Discharge Capillaries for high repetition rate operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of future applications of plasma-based particle accelerators, within the fields of high-energy physics and new light sources, the capability of plasma sources to operate at high repetition rates is crucial. In particular for gas-filled plasma discharge capillaries, which allow direct control over plasma properties, a key aspect is the longevity of the material, subject to erosion due to the heat flux delivered by high voltage plasma discharges. In this regard, we present an innovative design of discharge capillaries based on the use of different ceramic materials, which can sustain high voltage plasma discharges at high repetition rate and, moreover, be easily machined for the complex geometries required for plasma-based accelerators. Experimental campaigns are carried out at 10-150 Hz, assessing the longevity of ceramic capillaries by means of different diagnostic techniques. In addition, numerical simulations are performed to analyze the heat transfer within the whole plasma source. Results from experimental and numerical analysis highlight the capability of ceramic capillaries to preserve plasma properties and the integrity of the source during long-term plasma discharge operation at high repetition rate. In particular, we demonstrated the suitability of the proposed solution for the operative range of 100-400 Hz, foreseen for EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB project.</description>

      <title>Modelling Tritium Production and Release at High-Energy Proton Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tritium is a well-known byproduct of particle accelerator operations. To keep levels of tritium below regulatory limits, tritium production is actively monitored and managed at Fermilab. We plan to study tritium production in the targets, beamline components, and shielding elements of the Fermilab facilities such as NuMI, BNB, and MI-65. To facilitate the analysis, we construct a simple model and use three Monte Carlo radiation codes, FLUKA, MARS, and PHITS, to estimate the amount of tritium produced in these facilities. The analysis could also serve as an intercomparison between these code results related to tritium production. To assess the actual amounts of tritium that would be released from various materials, we employ a semi-empirical diffusion model. The results of this analysis are compared to experimental data whenever possible. This approach also helps to optimize proposed target materials with respect to the tritium production and release.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of a radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for collinear laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60\%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2~$\mu$s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of the RFQ cooler-buncher system also significantly improves the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>
