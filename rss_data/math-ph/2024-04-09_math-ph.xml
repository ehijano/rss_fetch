      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the Tzitz\'eica equation on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the renowned Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to investigate the initial value problem of Tzitz\'eica equation on the line. Initially, our analysis focuses on elucidating the properties of two reflection coefficients, which are determined by the initial values. Subsequently, leveraging these reflection coefficients, we construct a Riemann-Hilbert problem that is a powerful tool to articulate the solution of the Tzitz\'eica equation. Finally, the nonlinear steepest descent method is applied to the oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problem, which enables us to delineate the long-time asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the Tzitz\'eica equation across various regions. Moreover, it is shown that the leading-order terms of asymptotic formulas match well with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Free Field Realization of Supersymmetric W-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that supersymmetric(SUSY) W-algebra of generic level can be realized as an intersection of the kernels of the screening operators. Applying this result to the principal SUSY W-algebras, we get the free field realization of them inside the SUSY Heisenberg vertex algebras. Furthermore, the screening operators for principal SUSY W-algebras allow us to analyze their structure via the principal SUSY W-algebras associated with $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$, $\mathfrak{osp}(2|2)$, $\mathfrak{osp}(3|2)$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement bounds for single-excitation energy eigenstates of quantum oscillator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an analytic method for estimating the entanglement of the non-gaussian energy eigenstates of disordered harmonic oscillator systems. We invoke the explicit formulas of the eigenstates of the oscillator systems to establish bounds for their $\epsilon$-R\'enyi entanglement entropy $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. Our main result is a logarithmically corrected area law for the entanglement of eigenstates, corresponding to one excitation, of the disordered harmonic oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Mourre theory and spectral analysis of energy-momentum operators in relativistic quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central task of theoretical physics is to analyse spectral properties of quantum mechanical observables. In this endeavour, Mourre's conjugate operator method emerged as an effective tool in the spectral theory of Schr\"odinger operators. This paper introduces a novel class of examples amenable to Mourre's method, focusing on the spectra of energy-momentum operators in relativistic quantum field theory. Under the assumption of Lorentz or dilation covariance and the spectrum condition, we provide new proofs of the absolute continuity of the energy-momentum spectra, showcasing the efficiency of Mourre's method in the relativistic setting.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of dirty parafermionic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of $\mathbb Z_n$-symmetric non-Hermitian models of Baxter was shown by Fendley to be exactly solvable via a parafermionic generalization of the Clifford algebra. We study these models with spatially random couplings, and obtain several exact results on thermodynamic singularities as the distributions of couplings are varied. We find that these singularities, independent of $n$, are identical to those in the random transverse-field Ising chain; correspondingly the models host infinite-randomness critical points. Similarities in structure to exact methods for random Ising models, a strong-disorder renormalization group, and generalizations to other models with free spectra, are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of some model arising in the mathematical biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the article we establish the global well-posedness in W^{1, 2, 2}(R\times R^{+}) of the integro-differential equation in the case of the anomalous diffusion when the one dimensional negative Laplace operator is raised to a fractional power in the presence of the transport term. The model is relevant to the cell population dynamics in the Mathematical Biology. Our proof relies on a fixed point technique.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider optimization problems for interacting particle systems. We show that critical points solve a Vlasov equation, and that in general no minimizers exist despite continuity of the action functional. We prove an explicit representation of the relaxation of the action functional. We show convergence of N-particle minimizers to minimizers of the relaxed action, and finally characterize minimizers of dynamic interacting particle optimal transport problems as solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.</description>

      <title>$f(R,\square R)$-gravity and equivalency with the modified GUP Scalar field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the generalization of scalar field gravitational models with a minimum length we study the equivalent theory in modified theories of gravity. The quadratic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) gives rise to a deformed Heisenberg algebra in the application, resulting in the emergence of additional degrees of freedom described by higher-order derivatives. The new degrees of freedom can be attributed to the introduction of a new scalar field, trasforming the resulting theory into a two-scalar field theory. Thus, in order to describe all the degrees of freedom we investigate special forms of the sixth-order modify $f\left( R,\square R\right) -$theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian has similar properties~to~that of the GUP scalar field theory. Finally, the cosmological applications are discussed, and we show that the de Sitter universe can be recovered without introducing a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Heat flows from hot to cold: A simple rigorous example of thermalization in an isolated macroscopic quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present note, we discuss a simple example of a macroscopic quantum many-body system in which the approach to thermal equilibrium from an arbitrary initial state in the microcanonical energy shell is proved without relying on any unproven assumptions. The model, which is equivalent to a free fermion chain, is designed to be a toy model for a weakly heat-conducting one-dimensional solid. We take a phenomenological point of view and perceive that the system is in thermal equilibrium when the measured coarse-grained energy distribution is uniform.
  The result on thermalization reported here is a variation (and an improvement) of our previous result on the irreversible expansion in a free fermion chain. As far as we know, this is the first concrete and rigorous realization of the philosophy on the foundation of equilibrium statistical mechanics proposed by von Neumann in 1929, and further developed recently by Goldstein, Lebowitz, Mastrodonato, Tumulka, and Zangh\`\i and the present author, namely, to characterize thermal equilibrium from a macroscopic viewpoint and to make use of the strong ETH to control the long-time dynamics.
  This note will be the most technical part of my longer article on thermalization, "What is thermal equilibrium and how do we get there?". I am making this document public at this stage since I have already announced (and will announce) the results at some of my talks.</description>

      <title>Matter in Discrete Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary representations of the Poincare group of a discrete space-time are constructed, following the Wigner method in continuum relativity. They can be interpreted as elementary particles with one significant new feature: the momentum space being the 4-torus is identified as the Brillouin zone of space-time where all physical phenomena occur. Consequently 4-momentum is defined and conserved only modulo a reciprocal lattice vector of the order of the Planck mass, implying that there is no notion of an invariant mass except when it vanishes. In particular the propagation of massive particles have superluminal phases under very large (trans-Planckian) boosts. This behaviour leads to new features in early cosmology which are not in conflict with current knowledge.</description>

      <title>Continuum envelops on Fargues-Fontaine curves and elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the theory of Bridgeland stability conditions, which was originated from string theory, to study the derived category of coherent sheaves on Fargues--Fontaine curves. This leads us to consider the quasi-coherent sheaves $\mathcal{O}(\theta^{\pm})$ via the convergents of an irrational number $\theta$.
  We define the continuum envelop $\mathrm{QCoh}_{\mathbb{R}}(X_{FF})$ to be the smallest abelian subcategory in $\mathrm{QCoh}(X_{FF})$ containing $\mathrm{Coh}(X_{FF})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\theta^{\pm})$. We study the homological algebra of $\mathrm{QCoh}_{\mathbb{R}}(X_{FF})$ via Farey diagrams. We show that the homological property of $\mathcal{O}(\theta^{\pm})$ depends heavily on the arithmetic property of $\theta$. The Fargues--Fontaine curves present strong similarity with complex elliptic curves in this point of view.</description>

Abstract: A particular extension of Einstein's General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in the minimal quartic extension of Einstein's gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms in the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with a sufficient number of $e$-foldings and is compatible with the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of existence and properties of solitary waves of the Benjamin equation. The studied equation includes a parameter $ \gamma $ in front of the Benjamin-Ono term. % whose change in sign changes in turn certain properties of the energy. We show the existence, uniqueness, decay and orbital stability of solitary wave solutions obtained as a solution to a certain minimization problem, associated either with high speeds without sign condition on the parameter $\gamma$ or with small speeds for the appropriate sign. For any $ \gamma\in \mathbb{R}^* $, we prove the uniqueness and orbital stability of fast even ground state solitary waves. We also prove the uniqueness and orbital stability of slow ground state solitary waves for $ \gamma&gt;0 $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the motion of a thin layer of electrically conducting fluid, between two closely spaced parallel plates, in a classical Hele-Shaw geometry. Furthermore, let the system be immersed in a uniform external magnetic field (normal to the plates) and let electrical current be driven between conducting probes immersed in the fluid layer. In the present paper, we analyse the ensuing fluid flow at low Hartmann numbers. We first elucidate the mechanism of flow generation both physically and mathematically. We proceed by presenting mathematical solutions for a class of canonical multiply-connected geometries, in terms of the prime function developed by Crowdy (2020). Notably, those solutions can be written explicitly as series, and are thus exact, in doubly-connected geometries. Note that in higher connectivities, the prime function must be evaluated numerically. We then demonstrate how recently developed fast numerical methods may be applied to accurately determine the flow-field in arbitrary geometries when exact solutions are inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field on Quantum Phase Space: A Century after Ehrenfest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic transition dynamics lies at the core of many electron/hole transfer, photoactivated, and vacuum field-coupled processes. About a century after Ehrenfest proposed "Phasenraum" and the Ehrenfest theorem, we report a conceptually novel trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics approach, nonadiabatic field (NaF), based on a generalized exact coordinate-momentum phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. It does not employ the conventional Born-Oppenheimer or Ehrenfest trajectory in the nonadiabatic coupling region. Instead, in NaF the equations of motion of the independent trajectory involve a nonadiabatic nuclear force term in addition to an adiabatic nuclear force term of a single electronic state. A few benchmark tests for gas phase and condensed phase systems indicate that NaF offers a practical tool to capture the correct correlation of electronic and nuclear dynamics for processes where the states remain coupled all the time as well as for the asymptotic region where the coupling of electronic states vanishes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use constraint phase space [developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501], non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit empirically proposed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Phase-Field Model and an Entropy Stable Numerical Method for Simulating Two-Phase Flows with Thermocapillary Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we have derived a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model for two-phase flows with thermocapillary effects. This model accommodates variations in physical properties such as density, viscosity, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity between the two components. The model equations encompass a Cahn-Hilliard equation with the volume fraction as the phase variable, a Navier-Stokes equation, and a heat equation, and meanwhile maintains mass conservation, energy conservation, and entropy increase simultaneously. Given the highly coupled and nonlinear nature of the model equations, we developed a semi-decoupled, mass-preserving, and entropy-stable time-discrete numerical method. We conducted several numerical tests to validate both our model and numerical method. Additionally, we have investigated the merging process of two bubbles under non-isothermal conditions and compared the results with those under isothermal conditions. Our findings reveal that temperature gradients influence bubble morphology and lead to earlier merging. Moreover, we have observed that the merging of bubbles slows down with increasing heat Peclect number PeT when the initial temperature field increases linearly along the channel, while bubbles merge faster with heat Peclect number PeT when the initial temperature field decreases linearly along the channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational solitons (gravisolitons) are particular exact solutions of Einstein field equation in vacuum build on a given background solution. Their interpretation and importance is not yet fully clear and in this work we investigate the asymptotically behaviour of axially symmetric gravisolitons given minimal assumptions on the background metric. We develop an explicit systematic asymptotically expansion for the $N$-axialsoliton solution; we compute the leading order of the asymptotic killing vectors and we make a link with the corner symmetry proposal.</description>

      <title>Morphological stability of electrostrictive thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large electric field is typically present in anodic or passive oxide films. Stresses induced by such a large electric field are critical in understanding the breakdown mechanism of thin oxide films and improving their corrosion resistance. In this work, we consider electromechanical coupling through the electrostrictive effect. A continuum model incorporating lattice misfit and electric field-induced stresses is developed. We perform a linear stability analysis of the full coupled model and show that, for typical oxides, neglecting electrostriction underestimates the film's instability, especially in systems with a large electric field. Moreover, a region where electrostriction can potentially provide a stabilizing effect is identified, allowing electrostriction to enhance corrosion resistance. We identified an equilibrium electric field intrinsic to the system and the corresponding equilibrium film thickness. The film's stability is very sensitive to the electric field: a 40 percent deviation from the equilibrium electric field can change the maximum growth rate by nearly an order of magnitude. Moreover, our model reduces to classical morphological instability models in the limit of misfit-only, electrostatic-only, and no-electrostriction cases. Finally, the effect of various parameters on the film's stability is studied.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two systems are studied: the first one involves a charged particle under the influence of a constant electric field, and the second one involves a charged particle under the influence of a constant electromagnetic field. For both systems, it is possible to find time-dependent conserved operators that can be used to derive time-dependent solutions to the complete Schr\"odinger equation. These conserved operators are employed to define the symmetries of the system. An argument of invariance of the wave function under the action of a unitary operator leads to the quantization of resistance and resistivity, in integer multiples of the von Klitzing's constant, for the first and second cases respectively.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: II. The duality between closed and open chemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our ambition to construct high-dimensional phase diagrams featuring any thermodynamic variable on its axes, here we examine the duality between extensive and intensive conjugate variables in equilibrium thermodynamics. This duality manifests from the distinction between closed and open boundary conditions of a thermodynamic system, to the relationship between the Internal Energy and its Legendre transformations, to the point-line duality in calculating convex hulls versus half-space intersections. Here we focus on the duality relationships of chemical work, with extensive composition variables, N, and intensive chemical potentials, {\mu}. In particular, we explore mixed composition-chemical potential diagrams for oxynitride synthesis, lithium-ion cathode stability, and oxidation of high-entropy alloys. We further illustrate how chemical potential diagrams reveal the driving forces for non-equilibrium growth and dissolution kinetics.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: III. Engineering relative stability in four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams are also high-dimensional objects, and can represent phase coexistence between numerous phases simultaneously. On a 2D temperature-pressure phase diagram, phase boundaries are 1D lines separating two phases, with a slope given by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, dP/dT = {\Delta}S/{\Delta}V. Here, we derive a parametric form of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation that readily scales to high-dimensional phase boundaries. The gradient of a phase boundary guides us on how to increase or decrease the relative stability of a target compound, meaning this generalized Clausius-Clapeyron relation enables us to engineer relative stability with respect to multiple thermodynamic conditions simultaneously. Using this approach, we analyze the acid stability of manganese oxide catalysts on a 4-dimensional Pourbaix diagram with axes of pH, redox potential, nanoparticle size, and aqueous [K+] ion concentration.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field with Triangle Window Functions on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>

      <title>Level-Set Percolation of Gaussian Random Fields on Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit solution of the problem of level-set percolation for multivariate Gaussians defined in terms of weighted graph Laplacians on complex networks. The solution requires an analysis of the heterogeneous micro-structure of the percolation problem, i.e., a self-consistent determination of locally varying percolation probabilities. This is achieved using a cavity or message passing approach. It can be evaluated, both for single large instances of locally tree-like graphs, and in the thermodynamic limit of random graphs of finite mean degree in the configuration model class.</description>

Abstract: Applications of quantum mechanics rely on the accuracy of reading and writing data. This requires accurate measurements and preparations of the quantum states. I show that accurate measurements and preparations are impossible if the total Hamiltonian is bounded from below (as thought to be in our universe). This result invites a reevaluation of the limitations of quantum control, quantum computing, and other quantum technologies dependent on the accuracy of quantum preparations and measurements, and maybe of the assumption that the Hamiltonian is bounded from below.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a direct method of establishing the existence and uniqueness of saddle-node bifurcations for nonlinear equations in general domains. The method employs the scaled extended quotient whose saddle points correspond to the saddle-node bifurcations. The uniqueness of the saddle-node bifurcation point directly stems from the uniqueness of the saddle point. The method is applied to solving open problems involving the existence and uniqueness of the maximum saddle-node bifurcation for the positive solutions curve to an elliptic boundary value problem with a convex-concave nonlinearity in general domains.</description>

      <title>Substructures of the Weyl group and their physical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study substructures of the Weyl group of conformal transformations of the metric of (pseudo)Riemannian manifolds. These substructures are identified by differential constraints on the conformal factors of the transformations which are chosen such that their composition is associative. Mathematically, apart from rare exceptions, they are partial associative groupoids, not groups, so they do not have an algebra of infinitesimal transformations, but this limitation can be partially circumvented using some of their properties cleverly. We classify and discuss the substructures with two-derivatives differential constraints, the most famous of which being known as the harmonic or restricted Weyl group in the physics literature, but we also show the existence of a lightcone constraint which realizes a proper subgroup of the Weyl group. We then show the physical implications that come from invariance under the two most important substructures, concentrating on classical properties of the energy-momentum tensor and a generalization of the quantum trace anomaly. We also elaborate further on the harmonic substructure, which can be interpreted as partial gauge fixing of full Weyl invariance using BRST methods. Finally, we discuss how to construct differential constraints of arbitrary higher-derivative order and present, as examples, generalizations involving scalar constraints with four and six derivatives.</description>

      <title>New lower bounds for the (near) critical Ising and $\varphi^4$ models' two-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nearest-neighbour Ising and $\varphi^4$ models on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d\geq 3$ and obtain new lower bounds on their two-point functions at (and near) criticality. Together with the classical infrared bound, these bounds turn into up-to constant estimates when $d\geq 5$. When $d=4$, we obtain an ''almost'' sharp lower bound corrected by a logarithmic factor. As a consequence of these results, we show that $\eta=0$ and $\nu=1/2$ when $d\geq 4$, where $\eta$ is the critical exponent associated with the decay of the model's two-point function at criticality and $\nu$ is the critical exponent of the correlation length $\xi(\beta)$. When $d=3$, we improve previous results and obtain that $\eta\leq 1/2$. As a byproduct of our proofs, we also derive the blow-up at criticality of the so-called bubble diagram when $d=3,4$.</description>

Abstract: Significance Statement
  Phase diagrams are essential tools of the materials scientist, showing which phases are at equilibrium under a set of applied thermodynamic conditions. Essentially all phase diagrams today are two dimensional, typically constructed with axes of temperature-pressure or temperature-composition. For many modern materials, it would be valuable to construct phase diagrams that include additional forms of thermodynamic work--such as elastic, surface, electromagnetic or electrochemical work, etc.--which grows the free energy of materials into higher (&gt;3) dimensions. Here, we extend Gibbs' original arguments on phase coexistence to derive a generalized Phase Rule, based in the combinatorial geometry of high-dimensional convex polytopes. The generalized Phase Rule offers a conceptual and geometric foundation to describe phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams, which are relevant for understanding the stability of modern materials in complex chemical environments.
  Abstract We revisit Gibbs arguments on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances and show that phase coexistence regions in high-dimensional Internal Energy space, U(S,Xi,...,Xj), are simplicial convex polytopes--which are N-dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedra. In the first of this three-part series, we examine how the combinatorial relationships between the vertices and facets of simplicial polytopes leads to a generalized high-dimensional description of Gibbs' Phase Rule. Because Gibbs' Phase Rule describes the nature of phase boundaries on phase diagrams, this isomorphism between the physical principles of equilibrium thermodynamics and the geometry of simplicial polytopes provides the foundation to construct generalized phase diagrams, which can exist in any dimension, with any intensive or extensive thermodynamic variable on the axes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in the 2d Ising Model with a weak bidimensional quasi-periodic disorder in the interaction, the critical behavior is the same as in the non-disordered case, that is the critical exponents for the specific heat and energy-energy correlations are identical and no logarithmic corrections are present. The disorder produces a quasi-periodic modulation of the amplitude of the correlations and a renormalization of the velocities, that is the coefficients of the rescaling of positions, and of the critical temperature. The result establishes the validity of the prediction based on the Harris-Luck criterion and it provides the first rigorous proof of universality in the Ising model in presence of quasi-periodic disorder in both directions and for any angle. Small divisors are controlled assuming a Diophantine condition on the frequencies and convergence of the series is proved by Renormalization Group analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a general class of $N$-body Schr\"odinger operators with short-range pair-potentials the wave and scattering matrices as well as the restricted wave operators are all defined at any non-threshold energy. This holds without imposing any a priori decay condition on channel eigenstates and even for models including long-range potentials of Derezi\'nski-Enss type. In this paper we improve for short-range models on the known weak continuity properties in that we show that all non-threshold energies are stationary complete, resolving in this case a conjecture from [Sk1]. A consequence is that the above scattering quantities depend strongly continuously on the energy parameter at all non-threshold energies (improving on previously almost everywhere proven properties). Another consequence is that the scattering matrix is unitary at any such energy. As a side result we obtain a new and purely stationary proof of asymptotic completeness for $N$-body short-range systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guided by physical needs, we deal with the rotationally isotropic Poincar\'e ball, when considering the complement of Borromean rings embedded in it. We consistently describe the geometry of the complement and realize the fundamental group as isometry subgroup in three dimensions. Applying this realization, we reveal normal stochastization and multifractal behavior within the examined model of directed random walks on the rooted Cayley tree, whose six-branch graphs are associated with dendritic polymers. According to Penner, we construct the Teichm\"uller space of the decorated ideal octahedral surface related to the quotient space of the fundamental group action. Using the conformality of decoration, we define six moduli and the mapping class group generated by cyclic permutations of the ideal vertices. Intending to quantize the geometric area, we state the connection between the induced geometry and the sine-Gordon model. Due to such a correspondence we obtain the differential two-form in the cotangent bundle.</description>

However, an orientifold can break down the superconformal symmetry and no new superconformal fixed points are admitted (II scenario); nevertheless, in some cases, dubbed I and III scenarios orientifold, a new IR fixed point is achieved and, for III scenario examples, some still not fully understood IR duality seems to emerge. Here we give an algebro-geometrical point of view of III scenario orientifold for toric varieties and we propose the existence of relevant operators that deform the starting oriented CFT triggering a flow. We briefly discuss a possible holographic description of this flow.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the logarithmic energy for random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the semi-circle law, which is the limiting distribution in the Wigner theorem, is the minimizer of the logarithmic energy penalized by the second moment. A very similar fact holds for the Girko and Marchenko--Pastur theorems. In this work, we shed the light on an intriguing phenomenon suggesting that this functional is monotonic along the mean empirical spectral distribution in terms of the matrix dimension. This is reminiscent of the monotonicity of the Boltzmann entropy along the Boltzmann equation, the monotonicity of the free energy along ergodic Markov processes, and the Shannon monotonicity of entropy or free entropy along the classical or free central limit theorem. While we only verify this monotonicity phenomenon for the Gaussian unitary ensemble, the complex Ginibre ensemble, and the square Laguerre unitary ensemble, numerical simulations suggest that it is actually more universal. We obtain along the way explicit formulas of the logarithmic energy of the mentioned models which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Remark on the local well-posedness of compressible non-Newtonian fluids with initial vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss in this short note the local-in-time strong well-posedness of the compressible Navier-Stokes system for non-Newtonian fluids on the three dimensional torus. We show that the result established recently by Kalousek, M\'{a}cha, and Ne\v{c}asova in \doi{10.1007/s00208-021-02301-8} can be extended to the case where vanishing density is allowed initially. Our proof builds on the framework developed by Cho, Choe, and Kim in \doi{10.1016/j.matpur.2003.11.004} for compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the case of Newtonian fluids. To adapt their method, special attention is given to the elliptic regularity of a challenging nonlinear elliptic system. We show particular results in this direction, however, the main result of this paper is proven in the general case when elliptic $W^{2,p}$-regularity is imposed as an assumption. Also, we give a finite time blow-up criterion.</description>

      <title>A family of integrable maps associated with the Volterra lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Gubbiotti, Joshi, Tran and Viallet classified birational maps in four dimensions admitting two invariants (first integrals) with a particular degree structure, by considering recurrences of fourth order with a certain symmetry. The last three of the maps so obtained were shown to be Liouville integrable, in the sense of admitting a non-degenerate Poisson bracket with two first integrals in involution. Here we show how the first of these three Liouville integrable maps corresponds to genus 2 solutions of the infinite Volterra lattice, being the $g=2$ case of a family of maps associated with the Stieltjes continued fraction expansion of a certain function on a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g\geqslant 1$. The continued fraction method provides explicit Hankel determinant formulae for tau functions of the solutions, together with an algebro-geometric description via a Lax representation for each member of the family, associating it with an algebraic completely integrable system. In particular, in the elliptic case ($g=1$), as a byproduct we obtain Hankel determinant expressions for the solutions of the Somos-5 recurrence, but different to those previously derived by Chang, Hu and Xin. By applying contraction to the Stieltjes fraction, we recover integrable maps associated with Jacobi continued fractions on hyperelliptic curves, that one of us considered previously, as well as the Miura-type transformation between the Volterra and Toda lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The known asymptotic relations interconnecting Jacobi, Laguerre, and Hermite classical orthogonal polynomials are generalized to the corresponding exceptional orthogonal polynomials of codimension $m$. It is proved that $X_m$-Laguerre exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type I, II, or III can be obtained as limits of $X_m$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials of the same type. Similarly, $X_m$-Hermite exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type III can be derived from $X_m$-Jacobi or $X_m$-Laguerre ones. The quadratic transformations expressing Hermite classical orthogonal polynomials in terms of Laguerre ones is also extended to even $X_{2m}$-Hermite exceptional orthogonal polynomials.</description>

Abstract: In a series of previous works (arXiv:2104.11204, arXiv:2110.04565, arXiv:2301.07063), we gave a rigorous derivation of the homogeneous wave kinetic equation (WKE) up to small multiples of the kinetic timescale, which corresponds to short time solutions to the wave kinetic equation. In this work, we extend this justification to arbitrarily long times that cover the full lifespan of the WKE. This is the first large data, long-time derivation ever obtained in any nonlinear (particle or wave) collisional kinetic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we represent $n$-qubits as hypermatrices and consider various applications to quantum entanglement. In particular, we use the higher-order singular value decomposition of hypermatrices to prove that the $\pi$-transpose is an LU invariant. Additionally, through our construction we show that the matrix representation of the combinatorial hyperdeterminant of $2n$-qubits can be expressed as a product of the second Pauli matrix, allowing us to derive a formula for the combinatorial hyperdeterminant of $2n$-qubits in terms of the $n$-tangle.</description>

      <title>Memory Effects in Quantum State Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum memory assisted state verification task, where the local verifiers can store copies of quantum states and measure them collectively. We establish an exact analytic formula for optimizing two-copy state verification and give a globally optimal two-copy strategy for multi-qubit graph states involving only Bell measurements. When arbitrary memory is available to the verifiers, we present a dimension expansion technique that designs efficient verification strategies, showcasing its application to GHZ-like states. These strategies become increasingly advantageous with growing memory resources, ultimately approaching the theoretical limit of efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that quantum memories enhance state verification efficiency, sheding light on error-resistant strategies and practical applications of large-scale quantum memory-assisted verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find new bilinear relations for the partition functions of U(N)_k x U(N+M)_{-k} ABJ theory with two parameter mass deformation (m_1,m_2), which generalize the q-Toda-like equation found previously for m_1=m_2. By combining the bilinear relations with the Seiberg-like dualities and the duality cascade relations, we can determine the exact values of the partition functions recursively with respect to N. This method is more efficient than the exact calculation by the standard TBA-like approach in the Fermi gas formalism. As an application we study the large N asymptotics of the partition function with the mass parameters in the supercritical regime where the large N expansion obtained for small mass parameters is invalid.</description>

Abstract: The Hamiltonian analysis for the linearized $\lambda R$ gravity around the Minkowski background is performed. The first-class and second-class constraints for arbitrary values of $\lambda$ are presented, and two physical degrees of freedom are reported. In addition, we remove the second-class constraints, and the generalized Dirac brackets are constructed; then, the equivalence between General Relativity and the $\lambda R$ theory is shown.</description>

      <title>Symmetry criteria for the equality of interior and exterior shape factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lienhard (2019) reported that the shape factor of the interior of a simply-connected region ($\Omega$) is equal to that of its exterior ($\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\Omega$) under the same boundary conditions. In that study, numerical examples supported the claim in particular cases; for example, it was shown that for certain boundary conditions on circles and squares, the conjecture holds. In the present paper, we show that the conjecture is not generally true, unless some additional condition is met. We proceed by elucidating why the conjecture does in fact hold in all of the examples analysed by Lienhard. We thus deduce a simple criterion which, when satisfied, ensures the equality of interior and exterior shape factors in general. Our criterion notably relies on a beautiful and little-known symmetry method due to Hersch (1982) which we introduce in a tutorial manner.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>
