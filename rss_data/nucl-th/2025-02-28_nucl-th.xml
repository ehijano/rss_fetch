      <title>Correlations between neutron driplines and neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the nuclear symmetry energy and its density slope parameter on the neutron dripline and neutron star properties using a semi-classical liquid drop model (LDM) and energy density functionals constrained by chiral effective field theory. To analyze finite nuclei and mass tables, the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density is fixed, and the surface tension is determined to minimize the root-mean-square deviation of the total binding energy for 2208 nuclei. Correlations between symmetry energy parameters and neutron driplines, crust-core transition densities, and the radii of $1.4\,\msun$ neutron stars are explored using the LDM framework. Additionally, we examine the relationship between macroscopic properties, such as neutron star radii ($R_{1.4}$), and microscopic properties, including the number of isotopes and the last bound nucleus for $Z=28$, within the LDM context.</description>

      <title>Beta decay and electron capture rates on manganese isotopes in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotopes of manganese in the mass range A equal to 53 to 63 are abundant in the core material of high mass stars and are believed to be of prime importance in the progression of the pre collapse phases. During these late evolutionary phases, nuclear processes associated with weak interactions, including decay and electron capture (EC) on these isotopes, significantly alter the Ye (lepton to baryon ratio) of the cores composition. The temporal change of this parameter is one of the basic elements to simulate a successful explosion. Hence, the decay and EC rates of manganese (Mn) nuclides may serve as an important input in the simulation codes of core collapse supernova. In this paper, we focus on the study of the weak decay characteristics of 55 63Mn nuclides. The strength distributions of Gamow Teller transitions in the directions of decay and EC for these isotopes were calculated employing the proton neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) model. The decay half life values of Mn isotopes under terrestrial conditions were computed and compared with measured data and previous calculations. The pn QRPA estimated half lives are in good agreement with the experimental values. The and EC rates were later calculated covering a large range of stellar temperatures (001 30) 109 K and densities (10 1011) g/cm3.</description>

      <title>Investigation of weak-rates for odd-A nuclei for presupernova simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating weak decay rates under stellar conditions for studying presupernova evolution of massive stars is a challenging task. Here we show the importance of odd A nuclei for presupernova simulations. In order to calculate the required nuclear matrix elements we apply the pn QRPA model in a deformed basis. Nuclear deformation, thought to play an integral role in calculation of associated weak decay rates, is taken into account in our model. We calculate Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions, emission and positron capture rates for selected odd A nuclei. Our model does not employ the Brink Axel hypothesis as used in previous calculations of weak decay rates and we perform a state by state microscopic calculation of GT strength distributions from all parent excited states. Our calculated decay rates are in good agreement with large scale shell model calculations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inferences on covariant density functionals from multimessenger astrophysical data. I. Nucleonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Background] Bayesian inference frameworks incorporating multi-messenger astrophysical constraints have recently been applied to covariant density functional (CDF) models to constrain their parameters. Among these, frameworks utilizing CDFs with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings furnishing the equation of state (EoS) of compact star (CS) matter have been explored. [Purpose] The aforementioned inference framework has not yet incorporated astrophysical objects with potentially extreme high masses or ultra-small radii among its constraints, leaving its flexibility and predictive power under such extreme parameters still unknown. [Method] We apply the Bayesian inference framework based on CDFs with density dependent couplings. The astrophysical data is expanded to include not only the latest multi-messenger constraints from NICER and gravitational wave events but also the highest measured mass to date for the ``black widow" pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-radius estimates for the ultra-compact, low-mass object HESS J1731-347. [Results] Our systematic Bayesian analysis indicates that our CDF models can support higher maximum masses for CSs, reaching up to $2.4$-$2.5\,M_{\odot}$. However, achieving sufficient softening of the EoS in the low-density regime to accommodate the HESS J1731-347 data remains challenging. Nonetheless, we are able to impose tighter constraints on the parameter space of CDF models, ensuring consistency with current nuclear experimental and astrophysical data. [Conclusions] CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings encompass a wide range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, providing a robust theoretical framework for interpreting compact objects. However, the predicted lower limit for the radii of low-mass stars is approximately 12 km, which stems from the restricted degrees of freedom in the isovector sector.</description>

      <title>The $\eta^\prime N$ interaction from the $\eta^\prime p$ correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate for the first time the $\eta^\prime p$ femtoscopic correlation function to study the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction. We find it extremely sensitive to the value of the $\eta^\prime p$ scattering length, for which at present there exists only very limited information, not even knowing its sign. The measurement of this correlation function would provide much valuable information on the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction, which could then also be used to settle the issue of possible $\eta^\prime$ nucleus bound states, an issue attracting much attention in the nuclear physics community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theory (EFT) provides a powerful model-independent theoretical framework for illuminating complicated interactions across a wide range of physics areas and subfields. In this work, we consider the low-energy deuteron-Helium-4, triton-Helium-4, and helion-Helium-4 systems at low energies in cluster EFT. In particular, we focus on the deuteron + Helium-4 cluster configuration of the Lithium-6 nucleus, the triton + Helium-4 cluster configuration of the Lithium-7 nucleus, and the Helium-3-Helium-4 configuration of the Beryllium-7 nucleus, respectively. We illustrate how to directly extract the asymptotic normalization coefficient and several observables using experimental measurement of the electromagnetic form factors of these nuclei.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>Global Framework for Simultaneous Emulation Across the Nuclear Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical framework that combines ab initio many-body calculations with a Bayesian neural network, developing emulators capable of accurately predicting nuclear properties across the nuclear chart, including multiple isotopes simultaneously. We benchmark our developments using the oxygen isotopic chain, achieving accurate results for ground-state energies and nuclear charge radii, while providing robust uncertainty quantification. Our framework enables global sensitivity analysis of nuclear binding energies and charge radii with respect to the low-energy constants that describe the nuclear force.</description>

      <title>Structure of center vortex matter in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of center vortices is studied in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory for the first time to illuminate the interplay between elementary (center charge $\pm 1$) and doubly charged vortices. Unlike in SU(3), where charge $+2$ vortices are simply elementary vortices with reversed orientations in spacetime, these possibilities are physically distinct in SU(4). Visualizations of the vortex structure in three-dimensional slices reveal the various ways in which doubly charged objects manifest, as the convergence and matching of elementary vortices or as isolated doubly charged loops. An algorithm is described to classify every doubly charged chain as one of these three types. A collection of vortex statistics is considered to quantify the vortex structure. Many of these pertain to the novel doubly charged objects, including their relative proportions and chain lengths, which are analyzed to highlight the differences between each chain type. Three different lattice spacings are employed to investigate the approach to the continuum limit. Vortex matching chains are found to be shorter on average but also more prevalent than vortex convergences, ascribed to their interpretation as extended center monopoles. In addition, the lengths of both vortex convergences and vortex matchings are observed to follow an exponential distribution, allowing the introduction of a constant probability for a doubly charged chain to split into two elementary vortices as it propagates. Combined, these findings provide a characterization of the vortices that comprise center vortex structures in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>The Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule, i.e. the lowest odd moment of the parity-violating structure function, $F_3$, of the nucleon from a lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude. Our calculations are performed on $48^3 \times 96$ lattices at the $SU(3)$ symmetric point for two lattice spacings. We extract the moments for several values of the current momenta in the range $0.5 \lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 10 \; {\rm GeV}^2$, covering both the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes. We compare our moments to the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule and discuss the implications for higher-twist effects, a determination of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ from a hadronic quantity complementing the phenomenological and other lattice approaches, and electroweak box contributions crucial for CKM unitarity studies.</description>

      <title>Excluding Stable Quark Matter: Insights from the QCD Vacuum Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark matter (or quark nuggets), composed of quarks in the QCD deconfined and chiral-symmetry restored phase, has been conjectured to exist in nature for over half a century. With zero external pressure, it is stabilized by the balance between the quark Fermi pressure and the QCD vacuum pressure. Whether quark matter is more stable than ordinary nuclei has been a long-standing question, which requires understanding of the QCD vacuum energy. In this work, we employ both theoretical and data-driven methods to derive the QCD vacuum energy, utilizing the GMOR relation, the low-energy theorem, the equation of state from Lattice QCD, and the instanton gas/liquid model. The QCD vacuum energy is determined to be between $(163\,\mbox{MeV})^4$ and $(190\,\mbox{MeV})^4$. Alongside the quark matter pressure calculated from perturbative QCD calculations, both the 2-flavor (via Bodmer) and 2+1-flavor (via Witten) quark matter are found to be more than 100 MeV per baryon heavier than the nucleons. Therefore, we exclude the possibility of quark matter being a more stable state than ordinary nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. The models produce scattering events for a given neutrino energy. GAN models are trained on simulation data from NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating only quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the event distributions.</description>

      <title>Long-range interactions in double heavy tetraquarks $\bar Q \bar Q qq$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the large distances compared to the chiral symmetry breaking scale, a four-quark system $\bar Q \bar Q qq$ (with $Q$ as heavy and $q$ as light quarks) can be treated as two asymptotic mesons interacting via strong residual forces. The static heavy quark assumption enables using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where one can compute the potential between two heavy antiquarks in the presence of two light quarks of finite mass -- a prescription utilized in several lattice QCD studies. To analyse the long-range strong force in a $\bar Q \bar Q qq$ system, we study the interaction between two bottom mesons in the heavy quark limit using chiral effective field theory and dispersion theory with unphysical pion mass. We present methods to obtain two-pion-exchange potential between two static heavy mesons at non-physical pion mass and compare our preliminary results with the corresponding lattice QCD potentials.</description>

Abstract: We consider the rotational Brownian motion of heavy quark in QCD medium and provide predictions for polarization of open heavy-flavor hadrons. We calculate expressions for vector and tensor polarization, corresponding to baryon spin polarization and meson spin alignment, respectively. We propose that the transverse momentum dependence of heavy quark polarization may serve as a distinctive signature of the intense initial magnetic field generated in off-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quarks in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic basis with hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying on the fact that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which control the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of charm quark pairs through the rotation of Feynman diagrams such that the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams are exchanged. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Compared with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow in fixed-target $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne collisions as a probe of quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The System for Measuring Overlap with Gas (SMOG2) at the LHCb detector enables the study of fixed-target ion-ion collisions at relativistic energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\sim100$ GeV in the centre-of-mass). With input from \textit{ab initio} calculations of the structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne, we compute 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions for the anisotropic flow of Pb+Ne and Pb+O collisions, to be tested with upcoming LHCb data. This will allow the detailed study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation as well as experimental tests of the predicted nuclear shapes. Elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Pb+Ne collisions is greatly enhanced compared to the Pb+O baseline due to the shape of $^{20}$Ne, which is deformed in a bowling-pin geometry. Owing to the large $^{208}$Pb radius, this effect is seen in a broad centrality range, a unique feature of this collision configuration. Larger elliptic flow further enhances the quadrangular flow ($v_4$) of Pb+Ne collisions via non-linear coupling, and impacts the sign of the kurtosis of the elliptic flow vector distribution ($c_2\{4\}$). Exploiting the shape of $^{20}$Ne proves thus an ideal method to investigate the formation of QGP in fixed-target experiments at LHCb, and demonstrates the power of SMOG2 as a tool to image nuclear ground states.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Correlation Anisotropies in p + p Collisions Simulated by Pythia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulated by the keen interest of possible collective behavior in high-energy proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, we study two-particle angular correlations in pseudorapidity and azimuthal differences in simulated p + p interactions by the Pythia 8 event generator. Multi-parton interactions and color connection are included in these simulations which have been perceived to produce collectivity in final-state particles. Meanwhile, contributions from genuine few-body nonflow correlations, not of collective flow behavior, are known to be severe in those small-system collisions. We present our Pythia correlation studies in a pedagogical way and report azimuthal harmonic anisotropies analyzed by several methods. We observe anisotropies in those Pythia simulated events qualitatively and semi-quantitatively similar to experimental data. Our findings highlight the delicate nature of azimuthal anisotropies in small-system collisions, and provide a benchmark helping improve data analysis and interpret experimental measurements in small-system collisions.</description>

      <title>Imaging Freeze-out Sources and Extracting Strong Interaction Parameters in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining femtoscopic interferometry with an optical deblurring algorithm, we present a novel method to image the source in heavy-ion collisions (HICs) while simultaneously determining the interaction strength between particle pairs. The spatial distribution of the emission source has been reconstructed for protons ($p$) and antiprotons ($\bar{p}$) from the respective $pp$ and $\bar{p}\bar{p}$ correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. Within experimental uncertainties, protons and antiprotons share the same freeze-out distribution showing higher density in the center compared to the widely assumed Gaussian shape. The results evidence the matter-antimatter symmetry in coordinate space at the moment of freeze-out before the nucleons are fully randomized in the collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy-flavor hadrons produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are a sensitive probe for studying hadronization mechanisms of the quark-gluon-plasma. In this work, we survey how different transport models for the simulation of heavy-quark diffusion through a quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions implement hadronization and how this affects final-state observables. Utilizing the same input charm-quark distribution in all models at the hadronization transition, we find that the transverse-momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factor of various charm hadron species has significant sensitivity to the hadronization scheme. In addition, the charm-hadron elliptic flow exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the elliptic flow of the hadronizing partonic medium.</description>

      <title>Global coupled-channel analysis of $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ processes in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data from the BESIII and Belle are highly useful to understand vector charmonium ($\psi$) pole structures and puzzling lineshapes due to the exotic hadron candidates $Y$. We thus perform a global coupled-channel analysis of most of the available data (10 two-body, 9 three-body, and 1 four-body final states) in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV. Not only cross sections but also invariant mass distributions of subsystems are fitted. Our model includes dozens of (quasi) two-body states that nonperturbatively couple with each other through bare $\psi$ excitations, particle-exchange, and short-range mechanisms; approximate three-body unitarity is considered. The amplitudes obtained from the fit are analytically continued to $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles. We find $\psi$ states similar to those in the Particle Data Group listing and $Y(4320)$. Moreover, several $\psi$ states, including new ones, are found close to open charm thresholds. Two $Z_c$ poles are found as virtual states $\sim 40$ MeV below the $D^*\bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds, being consistent with lattice QCD results. This work presents the first global analysis to determine $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles, thereby paving the way to extracting detailed properties of the prominent exotic hadron candidates from data.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

      <title>Critical evaluation of reference charge radii and applications in mirror nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a critical review of absolute root-mean-square charge radii of stable nuclei from $Z=3$ to $Z=32$, which includes a previously overlooked uncertainty in the combined analysis of muonic x-ray and electron scattering experiments. From these \textit{reference radii} and isotope shift measurements, I obtain those of 12 mirror pairs with a traceable and realistic uncertainty budget. The difference in radii between mirror nuclei is found to be proportional to the isospin asymmetry, confirming recent calculations by Novario \emph{et al}~[PRL~130, 032501]. Assuming that this linear relation holds across the nuclear chart, the fitted proportionality constant, combined with the revised known radii, predicts the radii of 73 previously unknown mirror partners. These are useful e.g., for benchmarking atomic and nuclear theory, calibrating entire chains, and as an input to nuclear beta-decay calculations. The radii of $(T=1,T_z=0)$ nuclei are interpolated assuming negligible isospin symmetry breaking. This completes a model-independent, high-precision extraction of the charge and weak radii of all nuclei involved in the testing of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.</description>

      <title>Postmerger multimessenger analysis of binary neutron stars: Effect of the magnetic field strength and topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The oscillation modes of neutron star (NS) merger remnants, as encoded by the kHz postmerger gravitational wave (GW) signal, hold great potential for constraining the as-yet undetermined equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter. Previous works have used numerical relativity simulations to derive quasi-universal relations for the key oscillation frequencies, but most of them omit the effects of a magnetic field. We conduct full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of NSNS mergers with two different masses and two different EOSs (SLy and ALF2) with three different initial magnetic field topologies (poloidal and toroidal only, confined to the interior, and "pulsar-like": dipolar poloidal extending from the interior to the exterior), with four different magnetic field strengths with maximum values ranging from from $5.5\times 10^{15}G$ to $2.2\times 10^{17}G$ at the time of insertion. We find that magnetic braking and magnetic effective turbulent viscosity drives the merger remnants towards uniform rotation and increases their overall angular momentum loss. As a result, the $f_2$ frequency of the dominant postmerger GW mode shifts upwards over time. The overall shift is up to $\sim 200$Hz for the strongest magnetic field we consider and $\sim 50$Hz for the median case and is therefore detectable in principle by future GW observatories, which should include the magnetic field in their analyses. We also explore the impact of the magnetic field on the postmerger electromagnetic emission, and demonstrate that an extremely large magnetic field, or alternatively a significant shear viscosity mechanism, can cause a supramassive NS remnant to collapse to a BH in less than 100ms and lead to jet formation, although we do not expect the conditions for such an outcome to be realistic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>
