      <title>MOSAIC: Magnonic Observations of Spin-dependent Axion-like InteraCtions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an array-scalable, magnon-based detector (MOSAIC) to search for the spin-dependent interactions of electron-coupled axion dark matter. These axions can excite single magnons in magnetic targets, such as the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres used here, which are subsequently sensed by the detector. For MOSAIC, this sensing is implemented by coupling the magnons in the YIG spheres to magnetic-field-resilient single-electron charge-qubits, whose state is then interrogated with a quantum non-demolition measurement. Using standard superconducting fabrication techniques, MOSAIC can integrate many YIG sphere-qubit sensors, forming a large detector array. We outline the detector design and operation, and determine its sensitivity to axion dark matter. We find that a detector built with available technology will exceed the sensitivity of previous ferromagnetic haloscopes, and provides a platform where further improvements in performance would search for electron-coupled axion dark matter in unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Tensor hybrid mesons $\overline{b}gc$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and widths of the tensor hybrid mesons $H_{\mathrm{ bc}}$ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{bc}}$ with the structure $\overline{b}gc$ and spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{-}$ and $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{+}$ are calculated with high accuracy in the QCD sum rule framework. Information on their masses $m=(7.214\pm 0.075)~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\widetilde{m} =(7.685\pm 0.040)~\mathrm{GeV}$ enable us to determine decay channels of $H_{\mathrm{bc} }$ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{bc}}$. The full width of the meson $H_{ \mathrm{bc}}$ is estimated by considering the decays $H_{\mathrm{bc}} \to D^{+}\overline{B}^{\ast 0}$ and $D^{0}B^{\ast +}$. The channels $\widetilde{H }_{\mathrm{bc}}\to B^{+}D^{0}$, $B^{0}D^{+}$, $B^{\ast +}D^{\ast 0}$, $ B^{\ast 0}D^{\ast +} $, $B_{s}^{0}D_{s}^{+}$, and $B_{s}^{\ast 0}D_{s}^{\ast +}$ are studied to find the width of the $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{bc}}$ state. The widths of these processes are calculated using QCD three-point sum rule approach, which require estimation of the strong couplings at hybrid-meson-meson vertices. The results $(50.8 \pm 9.8)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $ (184.3\pm 22.8)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the full widths of the hybrid mesons $H_{ \mathrm{bc}}$ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{bc}}$ characterize them as relatively narrow and broad structures, respectively.</description>

      <title>Brazilian Report on Dark Matter 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key scientific objectives for the next decade is to uncover the nature of dark matter (DM). We should continue prioritizing targets such as weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), Axions, and other low-mass dark matter candidates to improve our chances of achieving it. A varied and ongoing portfolio of experiments spanning different scales and detection methods is essential to maximize our chances of discovering its composition. This report paper provides an updated overview of the Brazilian community's activities in dark matter and dark sector physics over the past years with a view for the future. It underscores the ongoing need for financial support for Brazilian groups actively engaged in experimental research to sustain the Brazilian involvement in the global search for dark matter particles</description>

      <title>A New Look At Small-$x$ Helicity Phenomenology: Investigating Uncertainties And The Impact Of Polarized Proton-proton Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation highlights the contributions I have made to the field of theoretical nuclear physics, specifically in high-energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). High-energy QCD is a robust subject and my research is refined to the sub-field of small-$x$ spin physics; small-$x$ physics is characterized by high-energy and density collisions and is well-suited for the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. Small-$x$ spin physics takes the ultra-relativistic description of high-energy QCD and gives special attention to spin-dependent interactions suppressed by powers of the center-of-mass energy. My expertise lies in exploring the theory and phenomenology relating to the KPS-CTT small-$x$ helicity evolution equations, a rubric that allows one to make predictions of the quarks' and gluons' distributions of spin at small-$x$. These predictions are heavily influenced by the initial conditions of the evolution, and the initial conditions are determined through analyses of world polarized data. My contributions focus on Bayesian parameter analysis, numerical and analytical calculations to discretize and cross-check the evolution equations, and the incorporation of a new observable into the pool of analyzed data. The results of such work show that the net amount of spin from quarks and gluons in the small-$x$ regime is predicted to be negative and/or potentially small; an analysis of polarized deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) data resulted in a net small-$x$ spin prediction that can be large and negative, but new results with the inclusion of data for single-inclusive jet production in polarized proton-proton ($pp$) collisions now estimate that the net amount of parton spin at small $x$ is small, with 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty that spans zero.</description>

      <title>The effect of decay cascade via an intermediate resonance in the $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \eta p $ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16444v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \eta p$ reaction has been investigated by the CBELSA/TAPS Collaboration, revealing a narrow structure in the $\eta p$ invariant mass distributions at a mass of $1700$ MeV. In this study, we explore the possibility that the narrow structure is caused by a decay cascade via an intermediate nucleon resonance decaying to $\eta p$ final states. The candidates for the intermediate nucleon resonances are $N(1700)3/2^{-}$ and $N(1710)1/2^{+}$, with masses near the observed structure. We consider the $t$-channel $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange diagrams, the $u$-channel nucleon-pole exchange diagram, the contact term, and the $s$-channel pole diagrams of nucleon, $\Delta$, and nucleon resonances when constructing the reaction amplitudes to reproduce the stripped individual contribution of the narrow structure. Our analysis indicates that the signature strength of the decay cascade $\gamma p \to \pi^{0}N(1700)3/2^{-} \to \pi^{0}\eta p$ is too weak to reach the experimental curve of the narrow structure due to the small decay branching ratio of $N(1700)3/2^{-}$ to $\eta p$. Although the decay cascade $\gamma p \to \pi^{0}N(1710)1/2^{+} \to \pi^{0}\eta p$ can qualitatively reproduce the experimental curve of the invariant mass distributions, its cross-section width is much larger than that of the corresponding experimental curve. Therefore, we conclude that the decay cascade via an intermediate nucleon resonance could not be the reason leading to the narrow structure in the $\eta p$ invariant mass distributions of the $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \eta p$ reaction.</description>

      <title>The role and contribution of resonance effect for the decay process of $\bar B^{0}_s \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}P$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size of the direct CP asymmetry generated during the weak decay of hadrons is attributed to the weak phase and some strong phases. The weak phase comes from the CKM matrix and a strong phase may result from the resonance effect which is produced by the mixing of vector meson $V\left\{\rho^{0}(770),\omega(782),\phi(1020)\right\}$ to $\pi^+ \pi^-$ meson pairs. $\rho^{0}(770)$ can decay directly into $\pi^+ \pi^-$ meson pairs, both $\omega(782)$ and $\phi(1020)$ can also decay into $\pi^+ \pi^-$ meson pairs with small contribution from isospin symmetry breaking. The main contribution for the middle state vector meson $\rho^{0}(770)-\omega(782)-\phi(1020)$ interference is the mix of $\rho^{0}(770)$, $\omega(782)-\rho^{0}(770)$ and $\phi(1020)-\rho^{0}(770)$. We calculate the CP asymmetry and decay branching ratio for $\bar{B}^0_{s} \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0 (\bar K ^{0})$ in the framework of QCD factorization and compare them with previous work. We also add the analysis of $\bar{B}^0_{s} \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \eta(\eta^{(')})$ decay process. The results show that the CP asymmetry of these four decay processes are significantly enhanced especially for the $\bar{B}^0_{s} \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \bar K ^{0}$ decay process and the decay branching ratio also changes under resonance effect. These work might provide support for the experimental analysis of the $\bar B^{0}_s$ meson.</description>

      <title>Criteria of Renormalizability in Effective Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any effective field theory relies on power counting rules that allow one to perform a systematic expansion of calculated quantities in terms of some soft scales. However, a naive power counting can be violated due to the presence of various hard scales in a given scheme. A typical example of such a scale is an ultraviolet regulator. This issue is particularly challenging when the interaction is nonperturbative. The power counting is expected to be restored in the course of renormalization, that is by redefining bare low-energy constants in the effective Lagrangian. Whether this procedure eventually leads to a self-consistent framework is not a priory obvious. We discuss various criteria of renormalizability in application to nuclear chiral effective field theory and provide several instructive counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Positivity Bounds on Higgs-Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider gravitational positivity bounds on the Higgs-portal scalar dark matter model. Applying gravitational positivity bounds with dark matter forward scattering process $\phi \phi \to \phi \phi$ to this DM model, we find that the new physics, besides the Higgs-portal dark matter physics, arises at an energy scale lower than $10^{10}$ GeV without the dark matter self-coupling. With the existence of the dark matter self-coupling, the hierarchical order of magnitude between the self-coupling $\lambda_{\phi}$ and the Higgs-portal coupling $\lambda_{h\phi}$ changes the game. With $\lambda_{\phi}/\lambda_{h\phi} = 10^{12}$, the GUT scale cutoff can realize. In this case, the dark freezeout scenario is possible for realizing the relic density of dark matter in the Universe. We find that $\lambda_{\phi} \sim O(1)$, $\lambda_{h\phi} \sim 10^{-12}$, and sub-GeV dark matter is implicated for the GUT scale cutoff possibility with the Higgs-portal dark matter model.</description>

      <title>The TeraZ Mirage: New Physics Lost in Blind Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of high-luminosity electron-positron colliders, such as FCC-ee and CEPC operating at the $Z$ pole (TeraZ), is expected to deliver unprecedented precision in electroweak measurements. These precision observables are typically interpreted within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), offering a powerful tool to constrain new physics. However, the large number of independent SMEFT operators allows for the possibility of blind directions, parameter combinations to which electroweak precision data are largely insensitive. In this work, we demonstrate that such blind directions are not merely an artefact of agnostic effective field theory scans, but arise generically in realistic ultraviolet completions involving multiple heavy fields. We identify several concrete multi-field extensions of the Standard Model whose low-energy SMEFT projections align with known blind subspaces, and show that these persist even after accounting for renormalisation group evolution and finite one-loop matching effects. Our analysis highlights that the apparent sensitivity to new physics of TeraZ may be significantly overestimated, and that indirect searches alone are often insufficient to rule out broad classes of ultraviolet physics. Complementary high-energy collider probes are therefore essential to fully explore the SMEFT parameter space.</description>

      <title>Testing the Gallium anomaly using Electron-Neutrino Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gallium anomaly is an unexplained deficit in the neutrinos observed during the calibration of GALLEX and SAGE using a $^{51}$Cr radioactive source and recently confirmed by BEST. The possible explanations for this deficit include an overestimation of the neutrino absorption cross section in Ga, an incorrect measurement of the source activity or the existence of sterile neutrinos. However, as this deficit has only been observed in Ga detectors, it has not been possible to distinguish among various proposals. Therefore, we propose an experiment using the same radioactive source but with a different detection method, electron-neutrino scattering. We discuss potential locations for such an experiment, estimating the main backgrounds and expected event rates, considering various target masses and source positions. Even if the anomaly does not result from the detection method, such an experiment can provide an independent determination of the branching ratio of the $^{51}$Cr decay by using the spectral information or observing the scattering angle. It is also sensitive to an eventual baseline dependence of the anomaly, as is predicted in sterile neutrino models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy proton-nucleus (pA) collisions have provided various clues for the role of cold nuclear matter effects in hadron production. In particular, multiple rescatterings of an incoming parton by the nuclear target are known to induce the radiation of many soft gluons, with those having a long formation time leading to the modification of hadron production rates due to fully coherent energy loss (FCEL). Here we present a recently derived formula for the induced single soft gluon radiation spectrum beyond leading logarithmic accuracy, whose main features are demonstrated with the example of $q\, g \to q\, g$ scattering.</description>

      <title>The Electric Dipole Moment of the electron in the decoupling limit of the aligned Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a discussion of model-independent contributions to the EDM of the electron. We focus on those contributions that emerge from a heavy scalar sector that is linearly realized. In particular, we explore the decoupling limit of the aligned 2HDM. In this model, Barr-Zee diagrams with a fermion loop produce logarithmically-enhanced contributions that are proportional to potentially large new sources of CP violation. In the decoupling limit these contributions are generated by effective dimension-6 operators via the mixing of four-fermion operators into electroweak dipole operators. These logarithmic contributions are not present in more constrained versions of the 2HDM where a $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry is imposed, which then controls the basis of effective operators needed to describe the new physics contributions to the electron EDM. Thus, the $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry provides a suppression mechanism. We then study how the experimental bounds on the electron EDM constrain the set of parameters of the aligned 2HDM.</description>

      <title>Reduction of $\epsilon$-expanded Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Feynman integrals (FIs) at higher spacetime dimensions are free of infrared and collinear divergence--and their ultraviolet divergences can be systematically subtracted--this allows us to construct a wide range of locally finite Feynman integrals. Especially, we propose a method named $\bar{R}$-operation to subtract out ultraviolet divergences that at the same time preserves infrared and collinear safety of the original FI. By expressing these locally finite FIs in terms of master integrals and imposing constraints on their $\epsilon$-expanded forms, we reduce the $\epsilon$-expanded master integrals to a minimal basis. We provide an automated package to identify such constraints, offering a tool useful for high-order perturbative computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>Electron positron pair production accompanied by giant dipole resonance at RHIC and LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs), the broad energy spectrum of photons enables a variety of physical processes, ranging from lepton pair production to giant dipole resonances (GDRs). In this work, we evaluate production of electron-positron pair production cross section with GDR. Specifically, we focus on Au+Au collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV per nucleon. We calculate cross sections while taking into account with and without the kinematic restrictions relevant to STAR detectors. We also present the differential cross sections in terms of the variables rapidity $(y)$, transverse momentum ($p_\perp$) and invariant mass ($M$) to compare them with respect to RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter with observable $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a GeV-scale self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) candidate within a dark $U(1)_D$ gauged extension of the Standard Model (SM), addressing small-scale structure issues in $\Lambda$CDM while predicting an observable contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ in the form of dark radiation. The model introduces a fermionic DM candidate $\chi$ and a scalar $\phi$, both charged under an unbroken $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. The self-interactions of $\chi$ are mediated by a light vector boson $X^\mu$, whose mass is generated via the Stueckelberg mechanism. The relic abundance of $\chi$ is determined by thermal freeze-out through annihilations into $X^\mu$, supplemented by a non-thermal component from the late decay of $\phi$. Crucially, $\phi$ decays after the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) but before the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) epoch, producing additional $\chi$ and a dark radiation species ($\nu_S$). This late-time production compensates for thermal underabundance due to efficient annihilation into light mediators, while remaining consistent with structure formation constraints. The accompanying dark radiation yields a detectable $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, compatible with Planck 2018 bounds and within reach of next-generation experiments such as SPT-3G, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD.</description>

      <title>Long distance contributions to neutral $D$-meson mixing from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of neutral $D$-meson mixing provides a unique probe of long-distance effects in the charm sector, where Standard Model contributions are dominated by nonperturbative effects. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using spectral reconstruction techniques within lattice QCD to compute the long-distance contributions to $D^0- \bar{D}^0$ mixing. After outlining the general formalism describing neutral meson mixing in the charm sector, we focus on the determination of the mixing amplitudes and the dimensionless parameters $x = \Delta m_D / \Gamma_D$ and $y = \Delta \Gamma_D /(2 \Gamma_D)$, which respectively encode the mass and width differences between the $D$-meson mass eigenstates. We discuss in detail the required theoretical and computational framework, including the definition and renormalization of the four-quark operators entering the $\Delta C = 1$ weak Hamiltonian, and strategies for evaluating the relevant correlation functions employing variance-reduction techniques. To extract the mixing amplitudes, we explore methods for reconstructing the spectral density from lattice correlators, providing preliminary assessments of the data quality required to reach the scaling regime, where the smearing width is small enough to yield physically meaningful results. Our findings lay the groundwork for future precision determinations of long-distance contributions to $D$-meson mixing from first principles.</description>

      <title>Bracketing the soliton-halo relation of ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In theories of ultralight dark matter, solitons form in the inner regions of galactic halos. The observational implications of these depend on the soliton mass. Various relations between the mass of the soliton and properties of the halo have been proposed. We analyze the implications of these relations, and test them with a suite of numerical simulations. The relation of Schive et al. 2014 is equivalent to $(E/M)_{\rm sol}=(E/M)_{\rm halo}$ where $E_{\rm sol (halo)}$ and $M_{\rm sol (halo)}$ are the energy and mass of the soliton (halo). If the halo is approximately virialized, this relation is parametrically similar to the evaporation/growth threshold of Chan et al. 2022, and it thus gives a rough lower bound on the soliton mass. A different relation has been proposed by Mocz et al. 2017, which is equivalent to $E_{\rm sol}=E_{\rm halo}$, so is an upper bound on the soliton mass provided the halo energy can be estimated reliably. Our simulations provide evidence for this picture, and are in broad consistency with the literature, in particular after accounting for ambiguities in the definition of $E_{\rm halo}$ at finite volume.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>Hawking-R\'enyi black hole thermodynamics, Kiselev solution, and cosmic censorship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit example, where the Hawking temperature of a black hole horizon is compatible with the black hole's R\'enyi entropy thermodynamic description, is constructed. It is shown that for every static, spherically symmetric, vacuum black hole space-time, a corresponding black hole solution can be derived, where the Hawking temperature is identical with the R\'enyi temperature, i.e. the one obtained from the R\'enyi entropy of the black hole via the 1st law of thermodynamics. In order to have this Hawking-R\'enyi type thermodynamic property, the black holes must be surrounded by an anisotropic fluid in the form of a Kiselev metric, where the properties of the fluid are uniquely determined by the mass of the black hole, $M$, and the R\'enyi parameter, {\lambda}. In the simplest Schwarzschild scenario, the system is found to be thermodynamically unstable, and the 3rd law of thermodynamics seems to play the role of a cosmic censor via placing an upper bound on the black hole's mass, by which preventing the black hole from loosing its horizon(s).</description>

      <title>A Note on the Stability of the Dark Energy Model from Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16764v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the stability of the dark energy model from time crystals proposed in [1]. We emphasize two ingredients, the coupling of the scalar field to gravity, and the fact that these time crystals are on an expanding FRW background, which play a crucial role in the field's dynamics. The Hubble parameter, which contributes a drag term to the equations of motion, grows with time until the scale factor diverges. When taken into account, these factors also alleviate the stability concern of [2].</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD determination of the radiative decay rates $h_{c}\to \eta_{c}\, \gamma$ and $h_{b}\to \eta_{b}\, \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of our lattice QCD computation of the hadronic matrix elements relevant to the $h_{c}\to \eta_{c}\gamma$ and $h_{b}\to \eta_{b}\gamma$ decays by using the gauge configurations produced by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration with $N_{f}=2+1+1$ dynamical Wilson-Clover twisted mass fermions at five different lattice spacings with physical dynamical $u$ , $d$, $s$ and $c$ quark masses (except for the the coarsest lattice for which the lightest sea quark corresponds to a pion with $m_{\pi}\simeq 175~\mathrm{MeV}$). While the hadronic matrix element for $h_{c}\to \eta_{c}\gamma$ is obtained directly, the one relevant to $h_{b}\to\eta_{b}\gamma$ is reached by working with heavy quark masses $m^{(n)}_{H} = \lambda^{n-1} m_{c}$, with $\lambda \sim 1.24$ and $n=1,2, \ldots ,6$, and then extrapolated to $m_{b}$ by several judicious ans\"atze. In the continuum limit we obtain $\Gamma( h_{c}\to \eta_{c} \gamma ) = 0.604(24)~\mathrm{MeV}$, which is by a factor of $2.3$ more accurate than the previous lattice estimates, and in good agreement with the experimental measurement. In the $b$-quark case we obtain $\Gamma( h_{b}\to \eta_{b} \gamma) =46.0(4.8)~\mathrm{keV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of coupled $DD_s^*$ and $D^*D_s$ scattering amplitudes in the $J^{P}=1^{+}$ channel and elastic $DD_s$ scattering amplitude in the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ channel.The aim is to investigate whether tetraquarks with flavor $cc\bar u\bar s$ exist in the region near threshold. Lattice QCD ensembles from the CLS consortium with $m_{\pi} \sim 280$ MeV, $a\sim0.09$ fm and $L/a = 24, 32$ are utilized. Finite-volume spectra are determined via variational analysis of two-point correlation matrices, computed using large bases of operators resembling bilocal two-meson structures within the distillation framework. The scattering matrix for partial wave $l=0$ is determined using lattice eigenenergies from multiple inertial frames following L\"uscher's formalism as well as following the solutions of Lippmann-Schwinger Equation in the finite-volume on a plane-wave basis. We observe small nonzero energy shifts in the simulated spectra from the noninteracting scenario in both the channels studied, which points to rather weak nontrivial interactions between the mesons involved. Despite the nonzero energy shifts, the lattice-extracted $S$-wave amplitudes do not carry signatures of any hadron pole features in the physical amplitudes in the energy region near the threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different computational techniques for cosmological phase transition parameters can impact the Gravitational Wave (GW) spectra predicted in a given particle physics model. To scrutinize the importance of this effect, we perform large-scale parameter scans of the dynamical real-singlet extended Standard Model using three perturbative approximations for the effective potential: the $\overline{\rm MS}$ and on-shell schemes at leading order, and three-dimensional thermal effective theory (3D EFT) at next-to-leading order. While predictions of GW amplitudes are typically unreliable in the absence of higher-order corrections, we show that the reconstructed model parameter spaces are robust up to a few percent in uncertainty. While 3D EFT is accurate from one loop order, theoretical uncertainties of reconstructed model parameters, using four-dimensional standard techniques, remain dominant over the experimental ones even for signals merely strong enough to claim a detection by LISA.</description>

      <title>Scheme-independent determination of the QCD running coupling at all scales from jet observables using the principle of maximum conformality and infinite-order scale setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to determining the strong coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$, over the entire range of validity of perturbative QCD, for scales above $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ and up to the Planck scale $\sim1.22\cdot10^{19}$\,GeV, with the highest precision and using the data of a single experiment. In particular, we use the results obtained for the thrust ($T$) and $C$-parameter ($C$) distributions in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at a single annihilation energy $\sqrt{s}=M_Z$ (i.e.\ at the $Z^0$ peak). This new method is based on the \emph{intrinsic conformality} (iCF) and on the Infinite-Order Scale Setting, using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (i.e.\ the PMC$_\infty$), which allows a rigorous determination of the renormalization scales for the event-shape variable distributions satisfying all of the requirements of Renormalization Group Invariance, including renormalization-scheme independence and consistency with Abelian theory in the $N_C \to 0$ limit. This new method is based on the scale-invariance of the iCF, which allows determination of $\alpha_s(\mu_0)$ at any scale $\mu_0$, and on the Maximum Likelihood statistical approach. We introduce a novel approach to determining the best-fitting range based on the most-likely-lowest $\chi^2$ calculated considering all possible intervals among the entire range of bins available in the perturbative region. This new method improves the precision and leads to results that are statistically more reliable. In particular, using data for thrust and $C$-parameter at the $Z^0$ peak from ALEPH, OPAL, DELPHI and L3 experiments, we obtain the average value: $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1181^{+0.0005}_{-0.0005}$, for the strong coupling. This determination of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ is consistent with the world average and has an improved precision with respect to the values obtained from the analysis of event shape observables currently used in the world average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We attempt to apply the Regge trajectory approach to the triply heavy triquarks $((QQ')\bar{Q}^{\prime\prime})$ $(Q,\,Q',\,Q^{\prime\prime}=b,\,c)$. We present the triquark Regge trajectory relations, and then employ them to crudely estimate the spectra of the triquarks $((cc)\bar{c})$, $((cc)\bar{b})$, $((bc)\bar{c})$, $((bc)\bar{b})$, $((bb)\bar{c})$, and $((bb)\bar{b})$. The $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are discussed. The triquark Regge trajectory becomes a new and very simple approach for estimating the spectra of triquarks. Moreover, the spin-averaged masses of the ground states of pentaquarks $(\bar{c}(cc))(cc)$, $(\bar{b}(cc))(cc)$ and $(\bar{c}(bb))(cc)$ are estimated, which are consistent with other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the resonant baryonic $B$ decay $B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p,{\cal P}_{cs}^0\to J/\psi \Lambda$, where ${\cal P}_{cs}^0\equiv {\cal P}_{cs}(4338)^0$ is identified as a hidden charm pentaquark candidate with strangeness. By interpreting ${\cal P}_{cs}^0$ as the $\Xi_c\bar D$ molecule that strongly decays into $J/\psi\Lambda$ and $\eta_c\Lambda$, we discover a dominant triangle rescattering effect for $B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p$, initiated by $B^-\to J/\psi K^-$. Through the exchange of a $\bar \Lambda$ anti-baryon, $J/\psi$ and $K^-$ undergo rescattering, transforming into ${\cal P}_{cs}^0$ and $\bar p$, respectively. Based on this rescattering mechanism, we calculate ${\cal B}(B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p,{\cal P}_{cs}^0\to J/\psi \Lambda) =(1.4^{+2.1}_{-1.1})\times10^{-6}$, which is consistent with the measured data.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $X(4475)$, $X(4500)$, $Z_{\bar{c}\bar{s}}(4600)$ and related tetraquark states with the QCD sum rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit P-waves to construct the diquark operators, then construct the local four-quark currents to explore the hidden-charm tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$ and $2^{++}$ in the framework of the QCD sum rules at length. Our calculations indicate tiny light-flavor $SU(3)$ breaking effects on the tetraquark masses due to the special currents and the predictions support assigning the $X(4775)$ and $X(4500)$ as the $[uc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{uc}]_{\widehat{V}}-[dc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{dc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ and $[sc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{sc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ respectively, and assigning the $Z_{c}(4600)$ and $Z_{\bar{c}\bar{s}}(4600)$ as the $[uc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{dc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ and $[qc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{sc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ respectively, and thus account for the LHCb's data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in superposed states minimally coupled to electromagnetism in curved spacetime within the WKB approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the curved-spacetime dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field and propagating in superposed states of different masses. For that purpose, we make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation with a minimal coupling to the Maxwell field in curved spacetime. We obtain the spin dynamics as well as the deviation from geodesic motion of such particles. The problem of having the mass eigenstates experience different proper times, as opposed to the case of neutral particles, is here dealt with by first extracting the second-order differential equation obeyed by each superposition. This strategy proves to be not only powerful, but also very economical.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant differences are around $30 \ \%$ for Ar and $80 \ \%$ for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The transition is dominated from the $3p$ shell electrons for Ar. For Xe, $5p$ states dominate the contribution, but, $4d$ states give $\sim 40\ \%$ contribution at 1 keV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system -- a unitary evolution followed by a measurement -- is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as quantum instruments. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The experimental reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model within the quantum field theory framework and, at the same time, constitutes a new foundational test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline the quantum process tomography approach applied to the $e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t}$ process at a polarized lepton collider.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution. Part I. Homogeneous medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense neutrino gases can exhibit collective flavor instabilities, triggering large flavor conversions that are driven primarily by neutrino-neutrino refraction. One broadly distinguishes between fast instabilities that exist in the limit of vanishing neutrino masses, and slow ones, that require neutrino mass splittings. In a related series of papers, we have shown that fast instabilities result from the resonant growth of flavor waves, in the same way as turbulent electric fields in an unstable plasma. Here we extend this framework to slow instabilities, focusing on the simplest case of an infinitely homogeneous medium with axisymmetric neutrino distribution. The relevant length and time scales are defined by three parameters: the vacuum oscillation frequency $\omega_E=\delta m^2/2E$, the scale of neutrino-neutrino refraction energy $\mu=\sqrt{2}G_F(n_\nu+n_{\overline\nu})$, and the ratio between lepton and particle number $\epsilon=(n_\nu-n_{\overline\nu})/(n_\nu+n_{\overline\nu})$. We distinguish between two very different regimes: (i) For $\omega_E\ll \mu \epsilon^2$, instabilities occur at small spatial scales of order $(\mu\epsilon)^{-1}$ with a time scale of order $\epsilon \omega_E^{-1}$. This novel branch of slow instability arises from resonant interactions with neutrinos moving along the axis of symmetry. (ii) For $\mu \epsilon^2\ll \omega_E\ll \mu$, the instability is strongly non-resonant, with typical time and length scales of order $1/\sqrt{\omega_E \mu}$. Unstable modes interact with all neutrino directions at once, recovering the characteristic scaling of the traditional studies of slow instabilities. In the inner regions of supernovae and neutron-star mergers, the first regime may be more likely to appear, meaning that slow instabilities in this region may have an entirely different character than usually envisaged.</description>

      <title>Fast Flavor Pendulum: Instability Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even in the absence of neutrino masses, a neutrino gas can exhibit a homogeneous flavor instability that leads to a periodic motion known as the fast flavor pendulum. A well-known necessary condition is a crossing of the angular flavor lepton distribution. In an earlier work, some of us showed that homogeneous flavor instabilities also obey a Nyquist criterion, inspired by plasma physics. This condition, while more restrictive than the angular crossing, is only sufficient if the unstable branch of the dispersion relation is bounded by critical points that both lie under the light cone (points with subluminal phase velocity). While the lepton-number angle distribution, assumed to be axially symmetric, easily allows one to determine the real-valued branch of the dispersion relation and to recognize if instead superluminal critical points exist, this graphical method does not translate into a simple instability condition. We discuss the homogeneous mode in the more general context of the dispersion relation for modes with arbitrary wave number and stress that it plays no special role on this continuum, except for its regular but fragile long-term behavior, owed to its many symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We study neutrinoless double-beta decay in extensions of the Standard Model that include $n$ right-handed neutrino singlets, with masses $m_s$ below the GeV scale. Generalizing recently developed matching methods, we determine the $m_s$ dependence of the short-range $nn \to pp$ couplings that appear to leading order in the chiral effective field theory description of neutrinoless double beta decay. We focus on two scenarios, corresponding to the minimal $\nu$SM and left-right symmetric models. We illustrate the impact of our new results in the case of the $\nu$SM, showing a significant impact on the neutrinoless double-beta decay half-life when $m_s$ is in the 200-800 MeV range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this analysis, we investigate the angular distribution of low-mass dimuon pairs produced in simulated electron-positron collisions at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), which operates at a center of mass energy of 500 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb\(^{-1}\). We focus on the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) variable, defined in the Collins-Soper frame. In the Standard Model, the production of low-mass dimuon pairs is primarily driven by the Drell-Yan process, which exhibits a pronounced forward-backward asymmetry. However, many scenarios beyond the Standard Model predict different shapes for the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) distribution. This angular distribution can be instrumental in distinguishing between these models in the event of excess observations beyond the Standard Model. We have used the mono-Z\(^{\prime}\) model to interpret the simulated data for our analysis. In the absence of any discoveries of new physics, we establish upper limits at the 95\% confidence level on the masses of various particles in the model, including the spin-1 \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, as well as fermionic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Blazar Boosted ALP and vector portal Dark matter confronting light mediator searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trouble in detecting low mass dark matter due to its low kinetic energy can be ameliorated in the boosted dark matter framework, where a sub-population of galactic dark matter attains very high energy after being up-scattered by energetic standard model particles. However, in such a scenario the upper limits on the cross-section obtained hitherto are typically large. Hence in the minimal extension of standard model where new mediators act as a portal between the dark and visible sectors, the direct detection limits for sub-GeV dark matter might lie within the exclusion region of other ground based searches of the mediator. To evade this deadlock, we allude to blazar boosted dark matter electron scattering in multi-ton neutrino detector Super kamiokande. We consider minimal models such as axion like particle (ALP) and vector portal dark matter being upscattered by high energy blazar jet and analyse the interesting parameter reaches from Super kamiokande in the parameter space of the mediator, surpassing the existing constraints. Besides, this scenario exhibits stronger limits for previously unexplored ALP mediated sub-MeV dark matter search which is difficult due to associated momentum suppression.</description>

      <title>Implications of the first CONUS+ measurement of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CONUS+ collaboration has reported their first observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). The experiment uses reactor electron antineutrinos and germanium detectors with recoil thresholds as low as $160~\mathrm{eV_\text{ee}}$. With an exposure of $327$ kg $\times$ d, the measurement was made with a statistical significance of $3.7 \sigma$. We explore several physics implications of this observation, both within the standard model and in the context of new physics. We focus on a determination of the weak mixing angle, nonstandard and generalized neutrino interactions both with heavy and light mediators, neutrino magnetic moments, and the up-scattering of neutrinos into sterile fermions through the sterile dipole portal and new mediators. Our results highlight the role of reactor-based \cevns~experiments in probing a vast array of neutrino properties and new physics models.</description>

Abstract: We present the results obtained by performing global fits of two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs) using the full Run 1 and Run 2 Higgs datasets collected at the LHC. Avoiding unwanted tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents and including the wrong-sign cases, we consider 12 scenarios across six types of 2HDMs: Inert, type I, type II, type III, type IV, and Aligned 2HDMs. Our main results are presented in Table III and Fig. 1. We find that the type-I 2HDM provides the best fit, while the wrong-sign scenarios of the type-II and type-IV 2HDMs, where the normalized Yukawa coupling to down-type quarks is opposite in sign to the Standard Model (SM), are disfavored. We also observe that the Aligned 2HDM gives the second-best fit when the Yukawa couplings to down-type quarks take the same sign as in the SM, regardless of the sign of the Yukawa couplings to the charged leptons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the temperature dependence of the relativistic degrees of freedom (dofs) of the plasma on lepton and baryon asymmetry. Motivated by the significant effect of the varying dofs on the tri-resonant leptogenesis particle model in low-scale leptogenesis, we show how this effect impacts the evolution of the lepton asymmetry in a simplified setup. We provide analytical approximations as well as numerical results showing that the simplified setup exhibits similar behavior as the concrete model. As the dofs enter the transport equations via the expansion rate of the Universe and the temperature of the plasma, we argue that any analysis must take these effects into account in order to be consistent.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on modulus stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the original Randall-Sundrum (RS) two-brane model, the radion potential was fine-tuned to zero, leaving the extra-dimensional modulus undetermined. Goldberger and Wise (GW) introduced a stabilization mechanism by incorporating a massive bulk scalar field, leading to a radion potential with a stable minimum. In this work, we examine the impact of the intrinsic stability of the GW scalar field on the modulus stabilization procedure. To elucidate this relationship, we test the stabilization scheme across several relevant scenarios using methods of singular perturbation theory. Our analysis consistently indicates a one-to-one correspondence between the stability of the GW scalar and successful modulus stabilization. Additionally, we highlight that certain classes of GW bulk potentials demonstrate such a correspondence explicitly, and provide checks which any GW bulk potential must satisfy in order to ensure modulus stabilization.</description>

Abstract: We derive the finite-temperature quantum-tunneling rate from first principles. The rate depends on both real- and imaginary-time; we demonstrate that the relevant instantons should therefore be defined on a Schwinger-Keldysh contour, and how the familiar Euclidean-time result arises from it in the limit of large physical times. We generalize previous results for general initial states, and identify distinct behavior in the high- and low-temperature limits, incorporating effects from background fields. We construct a consistent perturbative scheme that incorporates large finite-temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Localization mechanism of $q-$form field on the brane-world by coupling with gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the scalar fields can be trapped on branes of different types, and the $U(1)$ gauge vector fields can be localized on the thick de Sitter brane, or the thick Minkowski brane via coupling with gravity. The Kalb-Ramond fields can be localized on the Minkowski brane and the thick de-Sitter brane, with certain couplings. In this paper, with considering a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term of the $q-$form fields and the background spacetime, we investigate the localization of Kaluza-Klein modes for the $q-$form fields in $D-$dimensional spacetime. Concrete $q-$form fields are discussed within five-dimensional brane models with typical spacetime geometries: Minkowski, de Sitter, and Anti-de Sitter. In the Minkowski brane case, the zero modes of various $q-$form fields can be localized on the brane. In the de Sitter brane case, the zero mode of the $U(1)$ gauge vector fields can be localized on the brane. Lastly in the Anti-de Sitter brane case, the zero mode of the Kalb-Ramond fields can be localized on the brane. For the massive Kaluza-Klein modes of these $q-$form fields, they could be localized or quasi-localized on the brane of different types. Besides, subtle and detailed behaviors of the Kaluza-Klein modes for $q-$form fields are observed: the zero modes could be localized on both sides of the brane, and the massive modes could be localized or quasi-localized at the brane position.</description>

      <title>Revisiting constraints on primordial magnetic fields from spectral distortions of cosmic microwave background</title>

Abstract: The magneto-hydrodynamic decay of primordial magnetic fields can distort the black-body spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by draining magnetic energy into thermal plasmas and photons. The current limits on CMB distortion place constraints on small-scale primordial magnetic fields. The constraints crucially depend on the decay laws of primordial magnetic fields. Recent numerical simulations reveal that non-linear effects play a significant role in the magnetic field decay although these effects are neglected in previous works. In this paper, by adopting a reconnection-driven turbulent decay as a non-linear evolution model, we demonstrate the potential impact of non-linear effects on CMB spectral distortions. The reconnection-driven turbulent decay model is an analytical description which provides the consistent results with numerical simulation. Our results rule out magnetic fields with shorter coherence lengths. While the result is independent of the spectral index of the magnetic energy spectrum, it is influenced by the magnetic helicity fraction.</description>

      <title>High density symmetry energy: A key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is extended to include the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions by assuming the similar density, momentum, and isospin dependence as for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\rm TOV} \gtrsim 2M_\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics.</description>

      <title>ATLAS EFT Results in the Top Quark Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With no direct evidence for new physics at the TeV scale, deviations from the Standard Model (SM) can be explored systematically through Effective Field Theories (EFTs) such as the Standard Model EFT (SMEFT). SMEFT extends the SM by introducing higher-dimensional operators parametrized by Wilson coefficients, offering a framework to probe beyond the SM (BSM) effects. This contribution highlights three recent analyses using the ATLAS Run-2 dataset at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 140 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. Combined measurements improve the sensitivity to Wilson coefficients by reducing degeneracies and tightening constraints, exploring the potential of SMEFT in the top quark sector.</description>

      <title>Probing Signals of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Core Collapse in HI-Rich Galaxies</title>

Abstract: We analyze rotation curves of five HI-rich galaxies recently discovered with MeerKAT. These galaxies exhibit sharply rising rotation curves, while their baryonic components are not dynamically dominant, suggesting that their dark matter halos have high inner densities. When fitting the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model, four galaxies require extremely high halo concentrations, exceeding the cosmological median by $5\sigma$. In contrast, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos in the core-collapse phase naturally account for the high densities in these galaxies. For halos with masses around $10^{11}~{\rm M_\odot}$, those in cosmic filaments exhibit concentrations consistent with the cosmological average, while halos in cosmic nodes show relatively higher concentrations that align with the SIDM fits but remain insufficient for the NFW fits. Our analysis indicates that these HI-rich galaxies may have formed in cosmic nodes of dark matter with significant self-interactions.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>

Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Annihilating Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term. Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency (at the time of emission) $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where $H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the low frequency region $f&lt;f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$. Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H = \Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.</description>
