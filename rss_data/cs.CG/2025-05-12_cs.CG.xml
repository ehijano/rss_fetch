      <title>Designing 3D Anisotropic Frame Fields with Odeco Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method to synthesize a 3D tensor field within a constrained geometric domain represented as a tetrahedral mesh. Whereas previous techniques optimize for isotropic fields, we focus on anisotropic tensor fields that are smooth and aligned with the domain boundary or user guidance. The key ingredient of our method is a novel computational design framework, built on top of the symmetric orthogonally decomposable (odeco) tensor representation, to optimize the stretching ratios and orientations for each tensor in the domain. In contrast to past techniques designed only for isotropic tensors, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in generating smooth volumetric tensor fields with high anisotropy and shape conformity, especially for the domain with complex shapes. We apply these anisotropic tensor fields to various applications, such as anisotropic meshing, structural mechanics, and fabrication.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Emptiness Queries for Random Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-structure for orthogonal range searching for random points in the plane. The new data-structure uses (in expectation) $O\bigl(n \log n ( \log \log n)^2 \bigr)$ space, and answers emptiness queries in constant time. As a building block, we construct a data-structure of expected linear size, that can answer predecessor/rank queries, in constant time, for random numbers sampled uniformly from $[0,1]$.
  While the basic idea we use is known [Dev89], we believe our results are still interesting.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Distance in Unweighted Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet distance is a distance measure between trajectories in the plane or walks in a graph G. Given constant-time shortest path queries in a graph G, the Discrete Fr\'echet distance $F_G(P, Q)$ between two walks P and Q can be computed in $O(|P| \cdot |Q|)$ time using a dynamic program. Driemel, van der Hoog, and Rotenberg [SoCG'22] show that for weighted planar graphs this approach is likely tight, as there can be no strongly subquadratic algorithm to compute a $1.01$-approximation of $F_G(P, Q)$ unless the Orthogonal Vector Hypothesis (OVH) fails.
  Such quadratic-time conditional lower bounds are common to many Fr\'echet distance variants. However, they can be circumvented by assuming that the input comes from some well-behaved class: There exist $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximations, both in weighted graphs and in Rd, that take near-linear time for $c$-packed or $\kappa$-straight walks in the graph. In Rd, there also exists a near-linear time algorithm to compute the Fr\'echet distance whenever all input edges are long compared to the distance.
  We consider computing the Fr\'echet distance in unweighted planar graphs. We show that there exist no 1.25-approximations of the discrete Fr\'echet distance between two disjoint simple paths in an unweighted planar graph in strongly subquadratic time, unless OVH fails. This improves the previous lower bound, both in terms of generality and approximation factor. We subsequently show that adding graph structure circumvents this lower bound: If the graph is a regular tiling with unit-weighted edges, then there exists an $\tilde{O}( (|P| + |Q|)^{1.5})$-time algorithm to compute $D_F(P, Q)$. Our result has natural implications in the plane, as it allows us to define a new class of well-behaved curves that facilitate $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximations of their discrete Fr\'echet distance in subquadratic time.</description>
