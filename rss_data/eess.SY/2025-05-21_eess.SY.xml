      <title>Reduced Muscle Fatigue Using Continuous Subthreshold Kilohertz Stimulation of Peripheral Nerves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a prevalent technique commonly used to activate muscles in individuals with neurological disorders. Traditional FES strategies predominantly utilize low-frequency (LF) stimulation, which evokes synchronous action potentials, leading to rapid muscle fatigue. To address these limitations, we introduced a subthreshold high-frequency (HF) stimulation method that employed continuous, charge-balanced subthreshold current pulses at kilohertz frequencies, designed to evoke motor unit (MU) activation similar to voluntary activation. We evaluated the effectiveness of HF stimulation on the reduction of muscle fatigue across different force levels (10 %, 25 %, and 40 % of maximum force). The HF stimulation utilized continuous charge-balanced, short pulses of 80 {\mu}s (at a 10 kHz frequency) targeted the ulnar/median nerve bundles. We compared the fatigue effects with conventional LF stimulation and voluntary muscle contractions. Our results indicated that HF stimulation maintained more sustained force outputs and muscle activation over a prolonged time compared with LF stimulation. The HF stimulation also evoked a more dispersed muscle activation pattern, similar to voluntary muscle contractions. These findings suggest that HF stimulation can significantly enhance the sustainability of muscle contractions and reduce muscle fatigue, potentially improving the efficacy and applicability of FES in clinical and home-based settings for individuals with neurological impairments.</description>

      <title>Incremental Firmware Update Over-the-Air for Low-Power IoT Devices over LoRaWAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently supporting remote firmware updates in Internet of Things (IoT) devices remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of many IoT communication protocols, which often make it impractical to transmit full firmware images. Techniques such as firmware partitioning have been introduced to mitigate this issue, but they frequently fall short, especially in battery-powered systems where time and energy constraints are critical. As a result, physical maintenance interventions are still commonly required, which is costly and inconvenient in large-scale deployments. In this work, we present a lightweight and innovative method that addresses this challenge by generating highly compact delta patches, enabling firmware reconstruction directly on the device. Our algorithm is specifically optimized for low-power devices, minimizing both memory usage and computational overhead. Compared to existing solutions, our approach significantly reduces the data volume needed for updates while maintaining performance comparable to more complex alternatives. Experimental evaluations confirm that our method yields substantial time and energy savings, making it particularly well-suited for battery-powered IoT nodes. Although our implementation targets the LoRaWAN protocol, the approach is flexible and can be adapted to other IoT communication technologies.</description>

      <title>On the Input-Output Monotonicity of Voltage Dynamics of Power System with Grid-Forming Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of renewable resources is profoundly reshaping the dynamics of modern power systems. This study shows that the voltage dynamics of power systems with multiple grid-forming (GFM) converters often enjoys a desirable property called input-output monotonicity. A systematic approach for computing the derivatives of the voltage subsystem is presented first, which provides insight into the structural characteristics of these models. Next, the sign pattern of the trajectory Jacobian matrix associated with the voltage subsystem is analyzed and revealed. The analysis indicates that the voltage dynamics of power systems often exhibits the so-called input-output monotonicity property. The theoretical results are then validated through several simulation examples, underscoring their practical implications.</description>

      <title>Gaming Strategies in European Imbalance Settlement Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission System Operators (TSOs) rely on balancing energy provided by Balancing Service Providers (BSPs) to maintain the supply-demand balance in real time. Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) can simultaneously deviate from their day-ahead schedules in response to imbalance prices, e.g., by controlling flexible assets such as batteries. According to the European Electricity Balancing Guideline, these imbalance prices should incentivize BRPs performing such implicit or passive balancing to aid the TSO in restoring the energy balance. In this paper, we demonstrate that BRPs are unintentionally offered the opportunity to exploit gaming strategies in European imbalance settlement mechanisms. This is enabled by a disconnect between sub-quarter-hourly dynamics that determine the imbalance prices and the financial settlement on a quarter-hourly basis. We illustrate this behavior in a case study of the imbalance settlement mechanisms in Belgium and the Netherlands. Our results reveal that, in both countries, BRPs can, in theory, exploit the imbalance mechanism by increasing the instantaneous system imbalance during minutes within the quarter-hour that determine the imbalance price while still contributing to restoring the system balance for the rest of the quarter-hour.</description>

      <title>Statistically Optimal Structured Additive MIMO Continuous-time System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications in mechanical, acoustic, and electronic engineering require estimating complex dynamical models, often represented as additive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transfer functions with structural constraints. This paper introduces a two-stage procedure for estimating structured additive MIMO models, where structural constraints are enforced through a weighted nonlinear least-squares projection of the parameter vector initially estimated using a recently developed refined instrumental variables algorithm. The proposed approach is shown to be consistent and asymptotically efficient in open-loop scenarios. In closed-loop settings, it remains consistent despite potential noise model misspecification and achieves minimum covariance among all instrumental variable estimators. Extensive simulations are performed to validate the theoretical findings, and to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Functional Controllability, Functional Stabilisability, and the Generalised Separation Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the new concepts of Functional Controllability and Functional Stabilisability, and establishes their duality with Functional Observability and Functional Detectability, respectively. We further present a Generalised Separation Principle, demonstrating that the classical Separation Principle emerges as a special case. Conditions for the existence of functional controllers of a specified order are derived. Importantly, the design framework does not require full controllability. Furthermore, we develop a functional observer-based controller design applicable to systems that are both uncontrollable and unobservable. The results presented generalise the classical full-state feedback control paradigm.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Method to Identify IBRs with Dominant Participation in Sub-Synchronous Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven (i.e., model-free) approach to identify which inverter-based resources (IBRs) have dominant participation in poorly damped sub-synchronous oscillations (SSO), to get to the root cause for effective mitigation. An Enhanced Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) method is proposed that incorporates an appropriate set of observables. Based on time-synchronized data (either simulated or real) from IBR connection points, eDMD directly computes data-driven eigenvectors and participation factors to reveal the role of each IBR in poorly damped SSO. We show the improved accuracy of eDMD over conventional Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) by benchmarking both against actual model-based analysis. We demonstrate this first through a synthetic example and then a case study on the IEEE 39-bus test system with 100% IBR. This data-driven, model-free method offers a powerful tool to foresee and mitigate the risk of IBR-induced SSO in planning (simulated data) and post-event analysis (real data) of SSO events.</description>

      <title>Efficient Configuration-Constrained Tube MPC via Variables Restriction and Template Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configuration-Constrained Tube Model Predictive Control (CCTMPC) offers flexibility by using a polytopic parameterization of invariant sets and the optimization of an associated vertex control law. This flexibility, however, often demands computational trade-offs between set parameterization accuracy and optimization complexity. This paper proposes two innovations that help the user tackle this trade-off. First, a structured framework is proposed, which strategically limits optimization degrees of freedom, significantly reducing online computation time while retaining stability guarantees. This framework aligns with Homothetic Tube MPC (HTMPC) under maximal constraints. Second, a template refinement algorithm that iteratively solves quadratic programs is introduced to balance polytope complexity and conservatism. Simulation studies on an illustrative benchmark problem as well as a high-dimensional ten-state system demonstrate the approach's efficiency, achieving robust performance with minimal computational overhead. The results validate a practical pathway to leveraging CCTMPC's adaptability without sacrificing real-time viability.</description>

      <title>Security of Distributed Gradient Descent Against Byzantine Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the security of Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) algorithms on undirected graphs. Specifically, we consider Byzantine agents that inject stealthy attacks to degrade the performance of the DGD algorithm in terms of its optimal value. To mitigate the effect of stealthy attacks, some agents are allocated to monitor the evolution of their gradient. We then propose a method to quantify the maximum deviation caused by the Byzantine agent in the optimal value of the DGD. Our approach serves as a security metric to evaluate the robustness of graph structures against Byzantine attacks. We validate our findings through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Data-Driven Modeling Approaches for Control Optimization of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models that balance accuracy against computational costs are advantageous when designing wind turbines with optimization studies, as several hundred predictive function evaluations might be necessary to identify the optimal solution. We explore different approaches to construct low-fidelity models that can be used to approximate dynamic quantities and be used as surrogates for design optimization studies and other use cases. In particular, low-fidelity modeling approaches using classical systems identification and deep learning approaches are considered against derivative function surrogate models ({DFSMs}), or approximate models of the state derivative function. This work proposes a novel method that utilizes a linear parameter varying (LPV) modeling scheme to construct the DFSM. We compare the trade-offs between these different models and explore the efficacy of the proposed DFSM approach in approximating wind turbine performance and design optimization studies for controllers. Results show that the proposed DFSM approach balances computational time and model accuracy better than the system identification and deep learning based models. Additionally, the DFSM provides nearly a fifty times speed-up compared to the high-fidelity model, while balancing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Development of a Scaled Setup for Experimental Study of the Effect of Lateral Dynamics on Energy Consumption in Electric Vehicles: An Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14575v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the existing state-of-the-art approaches for energy consumption analysis do not account for the effect of lateral dynamics on energy consumption in electric vehicles (EVs) during vehicle maneuvers. This paper aims to validate this effect through an experimental study. We develop a scaled model using a radio-controlled (RC) car, modified to achieve dynamic similitude with on-road vehicles, to conduct scaled experiments. The experimental results confirm the impact of lateral dynamics on both energy demand and driving range in electric vehicles, aligning with our previous findings [1], and emphasize the need to incorporate these factors into energy consumption models. This is an extended version of a paper accepted at IEEE ITEC 2025. It includes additional results and analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective Edge AI for space object detection (SOD) tasks that can facilitate real-time collision assessment and avoidance is essential with the increasing space assets in near-Earth orbits. In SOD, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites must detect other objects with high precision and minimal delay. We explore an Edge AI solution based on deep-learning-based vision sensing for SOD tasks and propose a deep learning model based on Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers, Vision Transformers (ViT), and YOLOv9 framework. We evaluate the performance of these models across various realistic SOD scenarios, demonstrating their ability to detect multiple satellites with high accuracy and very low latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formal theory for analysing causality in cyber-physical systems. To this end, we extend the theory of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl to cope with the continuous nature of cyber-physical systems. Based on our theory, we develop an analysis technique that is used to uncover the causes for examples of failures resulting from verification, which are represented as continuous trajectories. We develop a search-based technique to efficiently produce such causes and provide an implementation for such a technique. Moreover, we apply our solution to case studies (a suspension system and a connected platoon) and benchmark systems to evaluate its effectiveness; in the experiment, we show that we were able to detect causes for inserted faults.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bipedal MPC with Foot-level Obstacle Avoidance and Adjustable Step Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision-free planning is essential for bipedal robots operating within unstructured environments. This paper presents a real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that addresses both body and foot avoidance for dynamic bipedal robots. Our contribution is two-fold: we introduce (1) a novel formulation for adjusting step timing to facilitate faster body avoidance and (2) a novel 3D foot-avoidance formulation that implicitly selects swing trajectories and footholds that either steps over or navigate around obstacles with awareness of Center of Mass (COM) dynamics. We achieve body avoidance by applying a half-space relaxation of the safe region but introduce a switching heuristic based on tracking error to detect a need to change foot-timing schedules. To enable foot avoidance and viable landing footholds on all sides of foot-level obstacles, we decompose the non-convex safe region on the ground into several convex polygons and use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming to determine the optimal candidate. We found that introducing a soft minimum-travel-distance constraint is effective in preventing the MPC from being trapped in local minima that can stall half-space relaxation methods behind obstacles. We demonstrated the proposed algorithms on multibody simulations on the bipedal robot platforms, Cassie and Digit, as well as hardware experiments on Digit.</description>

      <title>C*: A Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments using Rapidly Covering Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel sample-based algorithm, called C*, for real-time coverage path planning (CPP) of unknown environments. The C* algorithm is built upon the concept of Rapidly Covering Graph (RCGs). The RCG is constructed incrementally via progressive sampling during robot navigation, which eliminates the need for cellular decomposition of the search space. The RCG has a sparse-graph structure formed by efficient sampling and pruning techniques, which produces non-myopic waypoints of the coverage trajectory. While C* produces the desired back and forth coverage pattern, it adapts to the TSP-based locally optimal coverage of small uncovered regions, called coverage holes, that are surrounded by obstacles and covered regions. Thus, C* proactively detects and covers the coverage holes in situ, which reduces the coverage time by preventing the longer return trajectories from distant regions to cover such holes later. The algorithmic simplicity and low computational complexity of C* makes it easy to implement and suitable for real-time onboard applications. It is analytically proven that C* provides complete coverage of unknown environments. The performance of C* is validated by 1) extensive high-fidelity simulations and 2) real laboratory experiments using autonomous robots. A comparative evaluation with seven existing CPP methods demonstrate that C* yields significant performance improvements in terms of coverage time, number of turns, trajectory length and overlap ratio, while preventing the formation of coverage holes. Finally, C* is evaluated on two different applications of CPP using 1) energy-constrained robots and 2) multi-robot teams.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of the $L_\infty $-norm is an important issue in $H_{\infty}$ control, particularly for analyzing system stability and robustness. This paper focuses on symbolic computation methods for determining the $L_{\infty} $-norm of finite-dimensional linear systems, highlighting their advantages in achieving exact solutions where numerical methods often encounter limitations. Key techniques such as Sturm-Habicht sequences, Rational Univariate Representations (RUR), and Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) are surveyed, with an emphasis on their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and specific applicability to $ L_{\infty} $-norm computation. A comparative analysis is conducted between symbolic and conventional numerical approaches, underscoring scenarios in which symbolic computation provides superior accuracy, particularly in parametric cases. Benchmark evaluations reveal the strengths and limitations of both approaches, offering insights into the trade-offs involved. Finally, the discussion addresses the challenges of symbolic computation and explores future opportunities for its integration into control theory, particularly for robust and stable system analysis.</description>

      <title>VeRecycle: Reclaiming Guarantees from Probabilistic Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems after Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in the real world encounter a range of uncertainties. Probabilistic neural Lyapunov certification is a powerful approach to proving safety of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. When faced with changes beyond the modeled uncertainties, e.g., unidentified obstacles, probabilistic certificates must be transferred to the new system dynamics. However, even when the changes are localized in a known part of the state space, state-of-the-art requires complete re-certification, which is particularly costly for neural certificates. We introduce VeRecycle, the first framework to formally reclaim guarantees for discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems. VeRecycle efficiently reuses probabilistic certificates when the system dynamics deviate only in a given subset of states. We present a general theoretical justification and algorithmic implementation. Our experimental evaluation shows scenarios where VeRecycle both saves significant computational effort and achieves competitive probabilistic guarantees in compositional neural control.</description>

      <title>A system identification approach to clustering vector autoregressive time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model. Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR (Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable. We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and also scales well computationally.</description>

      <title>Sequential QCQP for Bilevel Optimization with Line Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Large-Scale Electric Power Grids with Adaptive Inertia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of AC power grids relies on ancillary services that mitigate frequency fluctuations. The electromechanical inertia of large synchronous generators is currently the only resource to absorb frequency disturbances on sub-second time scales. Replacing standard thermal power plants with inertialess new renewable sources of energy (NRE) therefore jeopardizes grid stability against e.g. sudden power generation losses. To guarantee system stability and compensate the lack of electromechanical inertia in grids with large penetrations of NREs, virtual synchronous generators, that emulate conventional generators, have been proposed. Here, we propose a novel control scheme for virtual synchronous generators, where the provided inertia is large at short times -- thereby absorbing faults as efficiently as conventional generators -- but decreases over a tunable time scale to prevent coherent frequency oscillations from setting in. We evaluate the performance of this adaptive inertia scheme under sudden power losses in large-scale transmission grids. We find that it systematically outperforms conventional, electromechanical inertia and that it is more stable than previously suggested schemes. Numerical simulations show how a quasi-optimal geographical distribution of adaptive inertia devices not only absorbs local faults efficiently, but also significantly increases the damping of inter-area oscillations. Our results show that the proposed adaptive inertia control scheme is an excellent solution to strengthen grid stability in future low-inertia power grids with large penetrations of NREs.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Observer Design for Inertial Navigation Systems with Almost-Global Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a system that integrates acceleration and angular velocity readings from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), along with other sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) position, GNSS velocity, and magnetometer, to estimate the attitude, velocity, and position of a vehicle. This paper shows that the INS problem can be analysed using the automorphism group of the extended special Euclidean group: a group we term the extended similarity group . By exploiting this novel geometric framework, we propose a synchronous observer architecture; that is, an observer architecture for which the observer error is stationary if the correction terms are set to zero. In turn, this enables us to derive a modular, or plug-and-play, observer design for INS that allows different sensors to be added or removed depending on what is available in the vehicle sensor suite. We prove both almost-global asymptotic and local exponential stability of the error dynamics for the common scenario of at least IMU and GNSS position. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first non-linear observer design with almost global convergence guarantees or with plug-and-play modular capability. A simulation with extreme initial error demonstrates the almost-global robustness of the system. Real-world capability is demonstrated on data from a fixed-wing UAV, and the solution is compared to the state-of-the-art ArduPilot INS.</description>

      <title>Beyond inherent robustness: strong stability of MPC despite plant-model mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this technical report, we establish the asymptotic stability of MPC under plant-model mismatch for problems where the origin remains a steady state despite mismatch. This class of problems includes, but is not limited to, inventory management, path-planning, and control of systems in deviation variables. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in numerical simulations, including the classic upright pendulum problem. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control Design for Multi-agent Systems via Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach that leverages Multi-agent Bayesian Optimization (MABO) to design Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) schemes for multi-agent systems. The primary objective is to learn optimal DMPC schemes even when local model predictive controllers rely on imperfect local models. The proposed method invokes a dual decomposition-based distributed optimization framework, incorporating an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based MABO algorithm to enable coordinated learning of parameterized DMPC schemes. This enhances the closed-loop performance of local controllers, despite discrepancies between their models and the actual multi-agent system dynamics. In addition to the newly proposed algorithms, this work also provides rigorous proofs establishing the optimality and convergence of the underlying learning method. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MABO-based learning approach.</description>

      <title>Process Resilience under Optimal Data Injection Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the resilience of process systems in an {\it information-theoretic framework}, from the perspective of an attacker capable of optimally constructing data injection attacks. The attack aims to distract the stationary distributions of process variables and stay stealthy, simultaneously. The problem is formulated as designing a multivariate Gaussian distribution to maximize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the stationary distributions of states and state estimates under attacks and without attacks, while minimizing that between the distributions of sensor measurements. When the attacker has limited access to sensors, sparse attacks are proposed by incorporating a sparsity constraint. {We conduct theoretical analysis on the convexity of the attack construction problem and present a greedy algorithm, which enables systematic assessment of measurement vulnerability, thereby offering insights into the inherent resilience of process systems. We numerically evaluate the performance of proposed constructions on a two-reactor process.</description>

      <title>Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to learn the time-varying stochastic computational resource usage of software as a graph structured Schr\"odinger bridge problem. In general, learning the computational resource usage from data is challenging because resources such as the number of CPU instructions and the number of last level cache requests are both time-varying and statistically correlated. Our proposed method enables learning the joint time-varying stochasticity in computational resource usage from the measured profile snapshots in a nonparametric manner. The method can be used to predict the most-likely time-varying distribution of computational resource availability at a desired time. We provide detailed algorithms for stochastic learning in both single and multi-core cases, discuss the convergence guarantees, computational complexities, and demonstrate their practical use in two case studies: a single-core nonlinear model predictive controller, and a synthetic multi-core software.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Failure Sampling for Evaluating Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Validating safety-critical autonomous systems in high-dimensional domains such as robotics presents a significant challenge. Existing black-box approaches based on Markov chain Monte Carlo may require an enormous number of samples, while methods based on importance sampling often rely on simple parametric families that may struggle to represent the distribution over failures. We propose to sample the distribution over failures using a conditional denoising diffusion model, which has shown success in complex high-dimensional problems such as robotic task planning. We iteratively train a diffusion model to produce state trajectories closer to failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on high-dimensional robotic validation tasks, improving sample efficiency and mode coverage compared to existing black-box techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the identifiability of nonlinear network systems with partial excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and topologies.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Online Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-model Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning in the general setting of nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, their ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient solution of moderately large-scale linear systems arising from the KKT conditions in optimal control problems (OCPs) is a critical challenge in robotics. With the stagnation of Moore's law, there is growing interest in leveraging GPU-accelerated iterative methods, and corresponding parallel preconditioners, to overcome these computational challenges. To improve the performance of such solvers, we introduce a parallel-friendly, parametrized multi-splitting polynomial preconditioner framework. We first construct and prove the optimal parametrization theoretically in terms of the least amount of distinct eigenvalues and the narrowest spectrum range. We then compare the theoretical time complexity of solving the linear system directly or iteratively. We finally show through numerical experiments how much the preconditioning improves the convergence of OCP linear systems solves.</description>

      <title>ViMo: A Generative Visual GUI World Model for App Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13936</link>

Abstract: App agents, which autonomously operate mobile Apps through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), have gained significant interest in real-world applications. Yet, they often struggle with long-horizon planning, failing to find the optimal actions for complex tasks with longer steps. To address this, world models are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions, enabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models primarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential visual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model designed to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of generating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort readability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content generation. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text Representation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while preserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict future GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding text. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the outcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to generate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App agents to make more informed decisions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beam-Stabilized, Additive-Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays with On-Chip Rapid Insight Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09870</link>

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with &lt; 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.</description>

      <title>MSCEKF-MIO: Magnetic-Inertial Odometry Based on Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To overcome the limitation of existing indoor odometry technologies which often cannot simultaneously meet requirements for accuracy cost-effectiveness, and robustness-this paper proposes a novel magnetometer array-aided inertial odometry approach, MSCEKF-MIO (Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter-based Magnetic-Inertial Odometry). We construct a magnetic field model by fitting measurements from the magnetometer array and then use temporal variations in this model-extracted from continuous observations-to estimate the carrier's absolute velocity. Furthermore, we implement the MSCEKF framework to fuse observed magnetic field variations with position and attitude estimates from inertial navigation system (INS) integration, thereby enabling autonomous, high-precision indoor relative positioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior velocity estimation accuracy and horizontal positioning precision relative to state-of-the-art magnetic array-aided INS algorithms (MAINS). On datasets with trajectory lengths of 150-250m, the proposed method yields an average horizontal position RMSE of approximately 2.5m. In areas with distinctive magnetic features, the magneto-inertial odometry achieves a velocity estimation accuracy of 0.07m/s. Consequently, the proposed method offers a novel positioning solution characterized by low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and high reliability in complex indoor environments.</description>
