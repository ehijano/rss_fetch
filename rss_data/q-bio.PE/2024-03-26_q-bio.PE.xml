      <title>Semi-Quantitative Analysis and Seroepidemiological Evidence of Past Dengue Virus Infection among HIV-infected patients in Onitsha, Anambra State, Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its endemic nature as well as the recent outbreaks, information on the opportunistic DENV in Anambra state has been sparse. This study thus aimed to give seroepidemiological evidence of past dengue virus infection among HIV-infected patients in Onitsha, Anambra State, Nigeria. Plasma from 94 HIV-infected patients who were attending Saint Charles Borromeo Hospital, Onitsha in Anambra State, Nigeria was tested for IgG antibodies specific to the dengue virus by IgG ELISA assay. The prevalence of past dengue virus infection was 61.7% (n = 58/94). This study showed age group 0-15 years (77.30%), female gender (65.1%), married (63.9%) and no formal level (100.0 %) as the highest seropositivity among the study participants. In terms of immunological and virological markers, greater IgG seroprevalence was observed in individuals with a viral load of &lt;40 copies/ml (64.0%) and a CD4 count of &gt;350 cells/ul (63.2%). The high IgG seropositivity of Dengue Virus (DENV) among HIV-infected individuals on Onitsha is cause for concern.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic diversity indices from an affine and projective viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic diversity indices are commonly used to rank the elements in a collection of species or populations for conservation purposes. The derivation of these indices is typically based on some quantitative description of the evolutionary history of the species in question, which is often given in terms of a phylogenetic tree. Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be employed, and there are close connections between the indices that are derived in these two different ways. In this paper, we introduce more general phylogenetic diversity indices that can be derived from collections of subsets (clusters) and collections of bipartitions (splits) of the given set of species. Such indices could be useful, for example, in case there is some uncertainty in the topology of the tree being used to derive a phylogenetic diversity index. As well as characterizing some of the indices that we introduce in terms of their special properties, we provide a link between cluster-based and split-based phylogenetic diversity indices that uses a discrete analogue of the classical link between affine and projective geometry. This provides a unified framework for many of the various phylogenetic diversity indices used in the literature based on rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees, generalizations and new proofs for previous results concerning tree-based indices, and a way to define some new phylogenetic diversity indices that naturally arise as affine or projective variants of each other.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Treatment of Animal Movement Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional track of an animal on a landscape has progressed over the past three decades from hourly to second-by-second recordings of locations. Track segmentation methods for analyzing the behavioral information in such relocation data has lagged somewhat behind, with scales of analysis currently at the sub-hourly to minute level. A new approach is needed to bring segmentation analysis down to a second-by-second level. Here, such an approach is presented that rests heavily on concepts from Shannon's Information Theory. In this paper, we first briefly review and update concepts relating to movement path segmentation. We then discuss how cluster analysis can be used to organize the smallest viable statistical movement elements (StaMEs), which are $\mu$ steps long, and to code the next level of movement elements called ``words'' that are $m \mu$ steps long. Centroids of these word clusters are identified as canonical activity modes (CAMs). Unlike current segmentation schemes, the approach presented here allows us to provide entropy measures for movement paths, compute the coding efficiencies of derived StaMEs and CAMs, and assess error rates in the allocation of strings of $m$ StaMEs to CAM types. In addition our approach allows us to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to assess and compare the best choices for the various parameters (number of steps in a StaME, number of StaME types, number of StaMEs in a word, number of CAM types), as well as the best clustering methods for generating segments that can then be used to interpret and predict sequences of higher order segments. The theory presented here provides another tool in our toolbox for dealing with the effects of global change on the movement and redistribution of animals across altered landscapes</description>

      <title>An early warning indicator trained on stochastic disease-spreading models with different noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The timely detection of disease outbreaks through reliable early warning signals (EWSs) is indispensable for effective public health mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, the intricate dynamics of real-world disease spread, often influenced by diverse sources of noise and limited data in the early stages of outbreaks, pose a significant challenge in developing reliable EWSs, as the performance of existing indicators varies with extrinsic and intrinsic noises. Here, we address the challenge of modeling disease when the measurements are corrupted by additive white noise, multiplicative environmental noise, and demographic noise into a standard epidemic mathematical model. To navigate the complexities introduced by these noise sources, we employ a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in infectious disease outbreak by training on noise-induced disease-spreading models. The indicator's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to real-world COVID-19 cases in Edmonton and simulated time series derived from diverse disease spread models affected by noise. Notably, the indicator captures an impending transition in a time series of disease outbreaks and outperforms existing indicators. This study contributes to advancing early warning capabilities by addressing the intricate dynamics inherent in real-world disease spread, presenting a promising avenue for enhancing public health preparedness and response efforts.</description>

      <title>PhyloGFN: Phylogenetic inference with generative flow networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetics is a branch of computational biology that studies the evolutionary relationships among biological entities. Its long history and numerous applications notwithstanding, inference of phylogenetic trees from sequence data remains challenging: the high complexity of tree space poses a significant obstacle for the current combinatorial and probabilistic techniques. In this paper, we adopt the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to tackle two core problems in phylogenetics: parsimony-based and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Because GFlowNets are well-suited for sampling complex combinatorial structures, they are a natural choice for exploring and sampling from the multimodal posterior distribution over tree topologies and evolutionary distances. We demonstrate that our amortized posterior sampler, PhyloGFN, produces diverse and high-quality evolutionary hypotheses on real benchmark datasets. PhyloGFN is competitive with prior works in marginal likelihood estimation and achieves a closer fit to the target distribution than state-of-the-art variational inference methods.

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of adapting pathogens and host immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As pathogens spread in a population of hosts, immunity is built up and the pool of susceptible individuals is depleted. This generates selective pressure, to which many human RNA viruses, such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, respond with rapid antigenic evolution and frequent emergence of immune evasive variants. However, the host's immune systems adapt and older immune responses wane, such that escape variants only enjoy a growth advantage for a limited time. If variant growth dynamics and reshaping of host-immunity operate on comparable time scales, viral adaptation is determined by eco-evolutionary interactions that are not captured by models of rapid evolution in a fixed environment. Here, we use a Susceptible/Infected model to describe the interaction between an evolving viral population in a dynamic but immunologically diverse host population. We show that depending on strain cross-immunity, heterogeneity of the host population, and durability of immune responses, escape variants initially grow exponentially, but lose their growth advantage before reaching high frequencies. Their subsequent dynamics follows an anomalous random walk determined by future escape variants and results in variant trajectories that are unpredictable. This model can explain the apparent contradiction between the clearly adaptive nature of antigenic evolution and the quasi-neutral dynamics of high frequency variants observed for influenza viruses.</description>

      <title>On some dynamical features of the complete Moran model for neutral evolution in the presence of mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a version of the classical Moran model, in which mutations are taken into account; the possibility of mutations was introduced by Moran in his seminal paper, but it is more often overlooked in discussing the Moran model. For this model, fixation is prevented by mutation, and we have an ergodic Markov process; the equilibrium distribution for such a process was determined by Moran. The problems we consider in this paper are those of first hitting either one of the ``pure'' (uniform population) states, depending on the initial state; and that of first hitting times. The presence of mutations leads to a nonlinear dependence of the hitting probabilities on the initial state, and to a larger mean hitting time compared to the mutation-free process (in which case hitting corresponds to fixation of one of the alleles).</description>

      <title>Four universal growth regimes in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dependent first passage percolation is a spreading process on a graph where the transmission time through each edge depends on the direct surroundings of the edge. In particular, the classical iid transmission time $L_{xy}$ is multiplied by $(W_xW_y)^\mu$, a polynomial of the expected degrees $W_x, W_y$ of the endpoints of the edge $xy$, which we call the penalty function. Beyond the Markov case, we also allow any distribution for $L_{xy}$ with regularly varying distribution near $0$. We then run this process on three spatial scale-free random graph models: finite and infinite Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees.
  We show that as the penalty-function, i.e., $\mu$ increases, the transmission time between two far away vertices sweeps through four universal phases: explosive (with tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but strictly sublinear, and linear in the Euclidean distance. The strictly polynomial growth phase here is a new phenomenon that so far was extremely rare in spatial graph models. The four growth phases are highly robust in the model parameters and are not restricted to phase boundaries. Further, the transition points between the phases depend non-trivially on the main model parameters: the tail of the degree distribution, a long-range parameter governing the presence of long edges, and the behaviour of the distribution $L$ near $0$. In this paper we develop new methods to prove the upper bounds in all sub-explosive phases. Our companion paper complements these results by providing matching lower bounds in the polynomial and linear regimes.</description>

      <title>Emergent time scales of epistasis in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces the extent of contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and novel functions, allows to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.</description>
