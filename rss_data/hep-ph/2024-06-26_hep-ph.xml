      <title>Study of Heavy Quarkonia in the presence of magnetic field by Nikiforov Uvarov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The N-dimensional radial Schrodinger equation has been solved using the Nikiforov Uvarov (NU) method, in which we used the medium modified form of Cornell potential and quasi-particle Debye mass with strong magnetic field background. The binding energies and the mass spectra of heavy quarkonium have been studied in the N-dimensional space for different values of magnetic field, the binding energy decreases with increasing magnetic field, which shows early dissociation of heavy quarkonium system. The influence of dimensionality number has also been discussed on binding energies of J/{\psi} and {\Upsilon} for fixed value of magnetic field. It is found that with an increase in dimensionality, the binding energy starts decreasing from a higher initial value. The results obtained are quite consistent with recent studies.</description>

      <title>Spurious gauge-invariance and $\gamma_5$ in Dimensional Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensional regularization is arguably the most popular and efficient scheme for multi-loop calculations. Yet, when applied to chiral (gauge) theories like the Standard Model and its extensions, one is forced to deal with the infamous "$\gamma_5$ problem". The only formulation that has been demonstrated to be consistent at all orders in perturbation theory, known as Breiteinlhoner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme, is rather cumbersome because of the lack of manifest chiral gauge-invariance. In this paper we point out that this drawback can be alleviated by the introduction of auxiliary fields that restore a spurious version of gauge-invariance. If combined with the background field method, all 1PI amplitudes and the associated counterterms are formally covariant and thus severely constrained by the symmetries. As an illustration we evaluate the symmetry-restoring counterterms at 1-loop in the most general renormalizable gauge theory with Dirac fermions and scalar fields, the Standard Model representing a particular example.</description>

      <title>Explaining PTA Results by Metastable Cosmic Strings from SO(10) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.095053), we have demonstrated that the 2023 PTA results, which hint at a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies, point towards a promising model-building route for realizing $SO(10)$ Grand Unification with embedded inflation. The proposed supersymmetric scenario solves the doublet-triplet splitting without fine-tuning, accounts for charged fermion and neutrino masses, avoids conflicts with current proton decay bounds, and includes only representations no larger than the adjoint. It features multi-step breaking of $SO(10)$ to the Standard Model gauge symmetry, with inflation embedded such that metastable cosmic strings are produced at the end of inflation. This cosmic string network generates a stochastic GW background that can explain the PTA results. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the singled out GUT model class, focusing on how the gauge coupling unification condition affects the scales of multi-step $SO(10)$ breaking and the preferred GW spectra. The lowest breaking scale, linked to inflation, the generation of right-handed neutrino masses for the seesaw mechanism, and metastable cosmic string production, coincides with the range suggested by the PTA results.</description>

      <title>The neutrino roof: Single-scatter ceilings in dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the maximum cross sections probed by single-scatter ``WIMP" searches in dark matter direct detection. Due to Poisson fluctuations in scatter multiplicity, these ceilings scale logarithmically with mass for heavy dark matter and often lie in regions probed by multiscatter searches. Using a generalized formula for single-scatter event rates we recast WIMP searches by the quintal-to-tonne scale detectors XENON1T, XENONnT, LZ, PANDAX-II, PANDAX-4T, DarkSide-50 and DEAP-3600 to obtain ceilings and floors up to a few $10^{17}$ GeV mass and $10^{-22}$ cm$^2$ per-nucleus cross section. We do this for coherent, geometric, isospin-violating xenophobic and argophobic spin-independent scattering, and neutron-only and proton-only spin-dependent scattering. Future large-exposure detectors would register an almost irreducible background of atmospheric neutrinos that would determine a dark matter sensitivity ceiling that we call the ``neutrino roof", in analogy with the well-studied ``neutrino floor". Accounting for this background, we estimate the reaches of the 10$-$100 tonne scale DarkSide-20k, DARWIN/XLZD, PANDAX-xT, and Argo, which would probe many decades of unconstrained parameter space up to the Planck mass, as well as of $10^3-10^4$ tonne scale noble liquid detectors that have been proposed in synergy with neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of ultralight bosons around compact objects: in-medium suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing between ultralight bosons and the Standard Model photon may allow access to the hitherto invisible Universe. In the presence of plasma, photons are dressed with an effective mass which will influence the conversion between the two. We study this phenomenon, known as in-medium suppression, in the context of black hole physics. We consider both axion-photon mixing around charged black holes and dark photon-photon mixing around neutral black holes. We find that the presence of plasma indeed influences the conversion rate, possibly quenching it altogether for large plasma densities, and discuss implications for superradiance and observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Stability of Dark Matter from Pauli Blocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why does dark matter (DM) live longer than the age of the Universe? Here we study a novel sub-eV scalar DM candidate whose stability is due to the Pauli exclusion of its fermionic decay products. We analyze the stability of the DM condensate against decays, scatterings (i.e., evaporation), and parametric resonance, delineating the viable parameter regions in which DM is cosmologically stable. In a minimal scenario in which the scalar DM decays to a pair of new exotic fermions, we find that scattering can populate an interacting thermal dark sector component to energies far above the DM mass. This self-interacting dark radiation may potentially alleviate the Hubble tensions. Furthermore, our scenario can be probed through precise measurements of the halo mass function or the masses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies since scattering prevents the DM from becoming too dense. On the other hand, if the lightest neutrino stabilizes the DM, the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) can be significantly altered from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction and thus be probed in the future by C$\nu$B detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the production of thermal dark matter (DM) candidates (WIMPs, SIMPs, ELDERs and Cannibals) during cosmic reheating. Assuming a general parametrization for the scaling of the inflaton energy density and the standard model (SM) temperature, we study the requirements for kinetic and chemical DM freeze-out in a model-independent way. For each of the mechanisms, up to two solutions that fit the entire observed DM relic density exist, for a given reheating scenario and DM mass. As an example, we assume a simple particle physics model in which DM interacts with itself and with SM through contact interactions. We find that low-temperature reheating can accommodate a wider range of couplings and larger masses than those permitted in the usual instantaneous high-temperature reheating. This results in DM solutions for WIMPs reaching masses as high as $10^{14}$~GeV, whereas for SIMPs and ELDERs, we can reach masses of $10^{13}$~GeV. Interestingly, current experimental data already constrain the enlarged parameter space of these models with low-reheating temperatures. Next-generation experiments could further probe these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor-Violating Higgs Decays Mediated by Ultralight Gauge Boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the lepton-flavor violating decay of the Higgs boson mediated by an ultralight gauge boson, $\chi$. Our analysis matches a model generating the lepton flavor-violating interaction $\bar{\ell}_i\ell_j\chi$ at tree level with an effective field theory, safeguarding the $\chi$-boson mass as it tends to zero. By utilizing the upper bounds on $H\to\ell_i \bar\ell_j$ decays from CMS and ATLAS Collaborations, we establish an indirect upper limit on the nonstandard decay $H\to\ell_i \bar\ell_j\chi$. The analysis encompasses various observables such as the lepton energy spectrum, Dalitz plot distribution, and Lepton Charge and Forward-Backward Asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Nonextensivity and temperature fluctuations of the Higgs boson production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the temperature fluctuations associated with the Higgs boson $p_T$ spectrum through the derivation of the string tension distribution corresponding to the QCD-based Hagedorn function, frequently used to fit the transverse momentum distribution (TMD). The identified string tension fluctuations are heavy tailed, behaving similarly to the $q$-Gaussian distribution. After the convolution with the Schwinger mechanism, both approaches correctly describe the entire TMD. This approach is the onset for the nonthermal description of the particle production in ultrarelativistic pp collisions. By analyzing the data of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =13$ TeV, we found that the average temperature associated with the Higgs boson differential cross section is around 85 times greater than the estimated value for the charged particle TMD. Our results show that the Higgs boson production exhibits the largest deviation from the thermal description.</description>

      <title>Improved wave function for heavy-light mesons in QCD potential model approach and parameterization of the Cornell potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report improved wave function for mesons in QCD potential model approach using multiplicative method for solution of Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the extreme cases of inter-quark separations ($r\rightarrow0$ and $r\rightarrow\infty$). Using the wave function we find the range of the scale factor c of the Cornell potential with reference to the mass scale of B and D sectors heavy-flavoured mesons. With our computed range of c, we also explore the critical inter-quark separation which should govern the choice of parent-child terms in perturbation method out of the linear and Coulombic terms of the Cornell potential.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Jet and Underlying Event Properties Across Various Models as a Function of Charged Particle Multiplicity at 7 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a comprehensive analysis of jets and underlying events as a function of charged particle multiplicity in proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV is presented. Various Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, including Pythia8.308, EPOS1.99, EPOSLHC, EPOS4$_{Hydro}$, and EPOS4$_{noHydro}$, are employed to predict particle production. The predictions from these models are compared with experimental data from the CMS collaboration. The charged particles are categorized into those associated with underlying events and those linked to jets. The analysis is restricted to charged particles with $|\eta| &lt; 2.4$ and $p_{T} &gt; 0.25$ GeV/c. Upon comparing the MC predictions with CMS data, it is observed that EPOS$4_{Hydro}$, EPOSLHC, and Pythia8 consistently reproduce the experimental results for all charged particles, underlying events, intrajet, and leading charged particles. For charged jet rates with $p_{T}^{ch.jet} &gt; 5$ GeV/c, EPOS4$_{Hydro}$ and Pythia8 perform exceptionally well. In the case of charged jet rates with $p_{T}^{ch.jet} &gt; 30$ GeV/c, EPOSLHC reproduces satisfactorily good results, while EPOS4$_{Hydro}$ exhibits good agreement with the data at higher charged particle multiplicities as compared to the other models. This can be attributed to the conversion of energy into flow when "Hydro=on," leading to an increase in multiplicity. EPOSLHC model described the data well due to the new collective flow effects, correlated flow treatment, and parametrization as compared to the EPOS1.99. However, the examination of the jet $p_{T}$ spectrum and normalized charged $p_{T}$ density reveals that EPOS4$_{Hydro}$, EPOS4$_{noHydro}$, and EPOSLHC exhibit good agreement with the experimental results, while Pythia8 and EPOS1.99 do not perform as well due to the lack of correlated flow treatment.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic production of dark relics: classical lattice vs. quantum 2PI in Hartree truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium production of non-minimally coupled self-interacting scalar dark matter during reheating using classical lattice simulations. The outcomes of the classical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the previous results obtained using the quantum 2PI approach in the Hartree truncation. In particular, the novel non-linear resonance found in the 2PI Hartee study is present also in the classical lattice simulations and can dominate the final dark matter yield. For the parameters considered, the difference in final value of the scalar two-point function between the two approaches is a factor of O(1).</description>

      <title>The $\Omega(2012)$ as a hadronic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new excited baryon state, $\Omega(2012)$, was observed in the invariant mass spectra of $K^-\Xi^0$ and $K^0_S \Xi^-$ by the Belle Collaboration. This state has a narrow width ($\sim 6$ MeV) compared to other baryon states with a similar mass. In this paper, we provide a mini-review on the $\Omega(2012)$ state from the molecular perspective, where it appears to be a dynamically generated state with spin-parity $3/2^-$ from the coupled-channels interactions of the $\bar{K} \Xi(1530)$ and $\eta \Omega$ in $s$-wave and $\bar{K} \Xi$ in $d$-wave. Additionally, alternative explanations for the $\Omega(2012)$ resonance are also discussed.</description>

      <title>MC-EKRT: Monte Carlo event generator with saturated minijet production for initializing 3+1 D fluid dynamics in high energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Monte-Carlo implementation of the EKRT model, MC-EKRT, for computing partonic initial states in high-energy nuclear collisions. Our new MC-EKRT event generator is based on collinearly factorized, dynamically fluctuating pQCD minijet production, supplemented with a saturation conjecture that controls the low-$p_T$ particle production. Previously, the EKRT model has been very successful in describing low-$p_T$ observables at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC energies. As novel features, our new MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, includes dynamical minijet-multiplicity fluctuations in the saturation and particle production, introduces a new type of spatially dependent nuclear parton distribution functions, and accounts for the conservation of energy/momentum and valence-quark number. In this proof-of-principle study, we average a large set of event-by-event MC-EKRT initial conditions and compute the rapidity and centrality dependence of the charged hadron multiplicities and elliptic flow for the LHC Pb+Pb and RHIC Au+Au collisions using 3+1 D viscous fluid-dynamical evolution. Also event-by-event fluctuations and decorrelations of initial eccentricities are studied. The good agreement with the rapidity-dependent data suggests that the same saturation mechanism that has been very successful in explaining the mid-rapidity observables, works well also at larger rapidities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipole interactions between dark sector states or between a Standard Model particle and a dark state can efficiently be searched for via high-intensity fixed-target facilities. We propose to look for the associated mono-$\gamma$ signature at the NA62 experiment running in beam-dump mode. Focusing on models of dipole inelastic Dark Matter and active-sterile neutrino dipole interactions, we compute the corresponding expected sensitivities finding promising prospects for discovery.</description>

      <title>Higgs Mass Predictions in the CP-Violating High-Scale NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a supersymmetric theory, large mass hierarchies can lead to large uncertainties in fixed-order calculations of the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs mass. A reliable prediction is then obtained by performing the calculation in an effective field theory (EFT) framework, involving a matching to the full supersymmetric theory at the high scale to include contributions from the heavy particles, and a subsequent renormalisation-group running down to the low scale. We report on the prediction of the SM-like Higgs mass within the CP-violating Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (NMSSM) in a scenario where all non-SM particles feature TeV-scale masses. The matching conditions are calculated at full one-loop order using two approaches. These are the matching of the quartic Higgs couplings as well as of the SM-like Higgs pole masses of the low- and high-scale theory. A comparison between the two methods allows us to estimate the size of terms suppressed by the heavy mass scale that are neglected in a pure EFT calculation as given by the quartic-coupling matching. Furthermore, we study the different sources of uncertainty which enter our calculation as well as the effect of CP-violating phases on the Higgs mass prediction. The matching calculation is implemented in a new version of the public program package NMSSMCALC.</description>

      <title>Flavour in $SU(5)$ Finite Grand Unified Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study four $SU(5) ~ N=1$ supersymmetric models which exhibit $S_3$ and/or $Z_N$ symmetries, that are finite to two or all loops, and their corresponding mass matrices. The first is an all-loop finite model based on an $S_3\times Z_3\times Z_2$ flavour symmetry, which leads to phenomenologically non-viable mass matrices. The remaining models, based on cyclic symmetries, show various mass textures, some of which are phenomenologically promising leading to a Nearest Neighbour Interaction texture. In particular, an all-loop finite model was identified, which has a significant parameter reduction and could reproduce the observed quark masses and mixing pattern. In the latter case the finiteness conditions determine the absolute value of the Yukawa couplings at the unification scale. For the two-loop finite models, the parametric solutions to the finiteness conditions lead to an allowed range of values for the Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale, also with a considerable reduction in the number of free parameters. Finally, we determine the minimum number of phases in the mass matrices and their position, not previously done in Finite Unified Theories, which contributes towards the reduction of parameters and a better understanding of the Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <title>Dark photon pair production via off-shell dark Higgs at FASER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dark photon model in which the dark U(1) gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by a vacuum expectation value of a new scalar boson. We focus on the ForwArd Search ExpeRiment (FASER) and calculate its sensitivity to the dark photon produced from the off-shell decay of the new scalar boson. It is found that the off-shell production extends the sensitivity region beyond the kinematical threshold of the on-shell decay of the scalar boson, and that the sensitivity region can be spanned to unexplored region. We also show the parameter space in which perturbative calculation is valid for the unitarity of an S matrix.</description>

      <title>Bell inequality is violated in charmonium decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental data on the charmonium decay helicity amplitudes make it possible to measure entanglement in final state spin correlations and test the violation of the Bell inequality it may entail. We find that the Bell inequality is violated with a significance of 5$\sigma$ or more in the decays $
  \eta_{c}, \, \chi_{c}^{0}, \, J/\psi ,\, \psi(3686) \to \Lambda +\bar \Lambda$
  $J/\psi \to \Xi^- +\bar \Xi^+,\; \Xi^0 +\bar \Xi^0, \;\Sigma^{-} +\bar \Sigma^{+},\; \Sigma^{0} +\bar \Sigma^{0}$
  $\psi(3686) \to \Xi^- +\bar \Xi^+,\; \Sigma^- +\bar \Sigma^+,\; \Sigma^{0} +\bar \Sigma^{0}$,
  $\chi^{0}_{c} \to \phi+ \phi $ . The decays $\chi_{c}^{1} \to \phi\phi$ and $\psi(3686) \to \Xi^0 +\bar \Xi^0$ show the same violation but with less significance. The decay $\psi(3686) \to \Omega^+ \Omega^-$ displays entanglement too. These results firmly establish the presence of entanglement and quantum non-separability at high energies, in a setting with particles of different spins and interacting through electroweak and strong interactions. In addition, the relatively long lifetime of some of the strange baryons emitted in the decays provides a natural probe to test whether quantum spin correlations remain present after the particles have interacted with the beam pipe and the first few layers of the detector.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Spin Particles, On Shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study on-shell scattering amplitudes for continuous-spin particles. Poincar\'e invariance, little-group $ISO(2)$ covariance, analyticity, and on-shell factorization (unitarity) impose stringent conditions on these amplitudes. We solve them by realizing a non-trivial representation for all little-group generators on the space of functions of bi-spinors. The three-point amplitudes are uniquely determined by matching their high-energy limit to that of definite-helicity (ordinary) massless particles. Four-point amplitudes are then bootstrapped using consistency conditions, allowing us to analyze the theory in a very transparent way, without relying on any off-shell Lagrangian formulation. We present several examples that highlight the main features of the resulting scattering amplitudes. Finally, we explore under which conditions it is possible to relax some assumptions, such as strict on-shell factorization, analyticity, or others. We show that continuous-spin particle dynamics may approximate gravity and electromagnetism in a loose version of $S$-matrix principles.</description>

      <title>Revisiting evolution of domain walls and their gravitational radiation with CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the publicly available CosmoLattice code, we conduct numerical simulations of a domain wall network and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) in a radiation-dominated Universe in the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field model. In particular, the domain wall evolution is investigated in detail both before and after reaching the scaling regime, using the combination of numerical and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that the total area of closed walls is negligible compared to that of a single long wall stretching throughout the simulation box. Therefore, the closed walls are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall network evolution. This is in contrast with the case of cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system in the scaling regime. To obtain the GW spectrum, we develop a technique that separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box size and non-zero lattice spacing. Our results on the GW spectrum agree well with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width, and a plateau/bump at intermediate scales. We also study sensitivity of obtained results on the choice of initial conditions. We find that different types of initial conditions lead to qualitatively similar domain wall evolution in the scaling regime, but with important variations translating into different intensities of GWs.</description>

      <title>Timing irregularities and glitches from the pulsar monitoring campaign at IAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Pulsars have a very stable rotation. However, sudden increases in their rotation frequency known as glitches, perturb their evolution. While large glitches are commonly detected, small glitches are harder to detect because of the lack of daily-cadence observations over long periods of time.
  Aims. We aim to explore the timing behaviour of young pulsars at daily timescales looking for small glitches and other irregularities. This will further our comprehension of the distribution of glitch sizes, which has also consequences for the theoretical modeling of the glitch mechanism.
  Methods. We observed six pulsars with up to daily cadence during 5 years with the antennas of the Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy (IAR). We used standard pulsar timing tools to characterise the rotation of pulsars and developed an algorithm to look for small timing events in the data and calculate the changes in $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$ at those epochs.
  Results. We found that the rotation of pulsars in this dataset is affected by small step changes in $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$. We found three glitches that had not been reported before: two in PSR J1048-5832 with relative sizes $\Delta\nu / \nu= 9.1(4) \times 10^{-10}$ and $\Delta\nu / \nu = 4.5(1) \times 10^{-10}$, and one in the Vela pulsar with a size $\Delta\nu / \nu = 2.0(2) \times 10^{-10}$. We also report new decay terms on the 2021 Vela giant glitch, and on the 2022 giant glitches in PSR J0742-2822 and PSR J1740-3015 respectively. Besides, we found that the red noise contribution significantly diminished in PSR J0742-2822 after its giant glitch in 2022.
  Conclusions. Our results highlight the importance of high-cadence monitoring with an exhaustive analysis of the residuals to better characterize the distribution of glitch sizes and to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind glitches, red noise and timing irregularities.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Correlators of Worldline Proper Length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical observer can measure elapsed proper time along their worldline. When observers are coupled to a system with internal correlations, measurements of elapsed time may inherit these correlations. We show that derivatives of the on-shell action with respect to worldline mass compute correlation functions of worldline proper length at tree level. We study worldlines coupled to a scalar field. We calculate the length-length two-point function and find it arises from correlated path fluctuations. As an application, we propose that the logarithm of local correlators serves as a generating function of length correlators, which generalizes the on-shell action prescription. Using this proposal, we extract AdS worldline observables from local CFT correlators as computed by Witten diagrams. We briefly discuss extensions to gravity, interferometers, and the holographic encoding of observer time.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the origin of Short Gamma ray Bursts with or without extended emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star - neutron star (BNS) and neutron star - black hole (NS-BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW 170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. The spatial distribution and merger rate differ between BNS mergers and NS-BH mergers. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing non-parametric methods, we investigated the origin of these burst types in terms of their formation rate. We examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without assuming any specific model.The luminosity function can be described as $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.09 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ for standard sGRBs and $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.09 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.21 \pm 0.22}$ for $z &lt; 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.22 \pm 0.47}$ for $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3$ for standard sGRBs, while for sGRBs with EE, it is $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.30 \pm 0.13}$ for $z &lt; 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.33 \pm 0.66}$ for $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3$. Based on these findings, we suggest that there is no significant difference in the progenitor stars of sGRBs with and without EE, considering the spatial offset and formation rate perspectives.</description>

      <title>Transient spin modes from relaxational axial kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spin mode by solving the axial kinetic equations under the relaxation time approximation in the presence of dissipative sources. We find transient spin modes in response to electric field with spacetime inhomogeneity, fluid acceleration and shear. To the lowest order in spatial gradient $k$, we find the responses to electric field and acceleration can be interpreted as retarded response to time variations of magnetic field and vorticity respectively. The response to shear can lead to a global spin polarization suppressed by powers of $k$. Beyond lowest order, the responses to all three sources are non-local with branch cut in the dispersions. We argue that the non-locality is a consequence of the quasi-particle picture underlying the kinetic description. We also analyze the mixing between spin modes and shear modes alone using the response we have obtained, finding the spin modes split into three with two of them developing oscillatory behavior. The correction to damping dispersions occur at $O(k^{4/3})$, which is parametrically larger than the existing one due to mixing of spin modes with shear and vorticity modes. It also indicates possible breakdown of gradient expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions within baryonic systems beyond the up and down quark sector is pivotal for a comprehensive description of nuclear forces. This study explores the interactions involving hyperons, particularly the $\Lambda$ particle, within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT). By incorporating $\Lambda$ hyperons into the NLEFT framework, we extend our investigation into the $S = -1$ sector, allowing us to probe the third dimension of the nuclear chart. We calculate the $\Lambda$ separation energies ($B_{\Lambda}$) of hypernuclei up to the medium-mass region, providing valuable insights into hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon ($YNN$) interactions. Our calculations employ high-fidelity chiral interactions at N${}^3$LO for nucleons and extend it to $\Lambda$ hyperons with leading-order S-wave $YN$ interactions as well as $YNN$ forces constrained only by the $A=4,5$ systems. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the SU(3) symmetry breaking and establish a foundation for future improvements in hypernuclear calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computation of spin-resummed observables in post-Minkowskian dynamics typically involve evaluation of Feynman integrals deformed by an exponential factor, where the exponent is a linear sum of the momenta being integrated. Such integrals can be viewed as tensor integral generating functions, which provide alternative approaches to tensor reduction of Feynman integrals. We develop a systematic method to evaluate tensor integral generating functions using conventional multiloop integration techniques. The spin-resummed aligned-spin eikonal at second post-Minkowskian order is considered as a phenomenologically relevant example where evaluation of tensor integral generating functions is necessary.</description>

      <title>Assessing Lepton Flavor Universality Violations in Semileptonic Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of recent measurements suggesting potential lepton flavor universality violations in semileptonic decays at collider experiments, this article provides a concise study of tree- and loop-level $B$-hadron semileptonic decays, $b \to c l \nu_l$ and $b \to s l^+ l^-$. We provide predictions for lepton flavor violating observables, $\mathcal{R}_{J/\psi}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\eta_c}$, across the entire $q^2$ range. Our study employs the Relativistic Independent Quark Model (RIQM), highlighting a model-dependent approach to these observables. We compare our model's predictions with existing lattice predictions, demonstrating the strong applicability of the RIQM framework in describing $B_c$ decays. Additionally, we reassess global averages for $\mathcal{R}_{D(D^*)}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{K(K^*)}$ in semileptonic transitions. With the upcoming experimental upgrades and the anticipated Run 3 data on $B_c$ meson decays, rapid confirmation of these quantities could indicate significant evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model, thereby opening new pathways for understanding the complex flavor dynamics in $B$ meson decays.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectrum of Non-Charmed and Charmed Meson States in Extended Linear-Sigma Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass spectrum of different meson particles is generated using an effective Lagrangian of the extended linear-sigma model (eLSM) for scalar and pseudoscalar meson fields and quark flavors, up, down, strange, and charm. Analytical formulas for the masses of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axialvector meson states are derived assuming global chiral symmetry. The various eLSM parameters are analytically deduced and numerically computed. This enables accurate estimations of the masses of sixteen non-charmed and thirteen charmed meson states at vanishing temperature. The comparison of these results to recent compilation of the particle data group (PDG) allows to draw the conclusion that the masses of sixteen non-charmed and thirteen charmed meson states calculated in the eLSM are in good agreement with the PDG. This shows that the eLSM, with its configurations and parameters, is an effective theoretical framework for determining the mass spectra of various non-charmed and charmed meson states, particularly at vanishing temperature.</description>

      <title>Large extra dimensions from higher-dimensional inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the possibility that compact extra dimensions can obtain large size by higher dimensional inflation, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Solution to the horizon problem implies that the fundamental scale of gravity is smaller than $10^{13}$ GeV which can be realised in a braneworld framework for any number of extra dimensions. However, requirement of (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations makes this simple proposal possible only for one extra dimension at around the micron scale. After the end of five-dimensional inflation, the radion modulus can be stabilised at a vacuum with positive energy of the order of the present dark energy scale. An attractive possibility is based on the contribution to the Casimir energy of right-handed neutrinos with a mass at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Secondary Lepton Production, Propagation, and Interactions with NuLeptonSim</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged current interactions of neutrinos inside the Earth can result in secondary muons and {\tau} - leptons which are detectable by a large swath of existing and planned neutrino experiments through a wide variety of event topologies. Consideration of such events can improve detector performance and provide unique signatures which help with event reconstruction. In this work, we describe NuLeptonSim, a propagation tool for neutrinos and charged leptons that builds on the fast NuTauSim framework. NuLeptonSim considers energy losses of charged leptons, modelled both continuously for performance or stochastically for accuracy, as well as interaction models for all flavors of neutrinos, including the Glashow resonance. We demonstrate the results from including these effects on the Earth emergence probability of various charged leptons from different flavors of primary neutrino and their corresponding energy distributions. We find that the emergence probability of muons can be higher than that of taus for energies below 100 PeV, whether from a primary muon or {\tau} neutrino, and that the Glashow resonance contributes to a surplus of emerging leptons near the resonant energy.</description>

Abstract: We present the calculation of the contribtuions from the chromomagnetic and four-top-quark-operators within Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to Higgs boson pair production in gluon fusion, combined with full NLO QCD corrections. We study the effects of these operators on the total cross section and the invariant mass distribution of the Higgs-boson pair, at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV. These subleading operators are implemented in the generator ggHH_SMEFT, in the same Powheg-Box-V2 framework as the leading operators, such that their effects can be easily studied in a unified setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses approximate analytical formulas and numerical results with the bino-dominated dark matter (DM) as an example to analyze the impact of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment on the DM phenomenology and naturalness in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We conclude that the limitation of the latest LZ experiment worsens the naturalness of the MSSM, as the predictions of the $Z$-boson mass and DM relic density demonstrate, particularly in the regions where the correct DM relic density is obtained by the $Z$- or $h$-mediated resonant annihilations.</description>

      <title>Neutron-antineutron oscillation accompanied by CP-violation in magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation accompanied by CP-violation in the presence of magnetic fields. The $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation, which violates the baryon number ($\mathcal{B}$) by two units ($|\Delta \mathcal{B}| = 2$), can be originated from the mixing between the neutron ($n$) and the neutral elementary particle ($\eta$) and may give rise to non-trivial effects that are different from previous theoretical predictions. We show that the probability of the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation can be greatly enhanced by adjusting the magnetic field properly. In particular, the peak values of the oscillation probability in the presence of resonance magnetic fields can be $8$-$10$ orders of magnitude higher than that in the absence of magnetic fields. We point out that there might not be sizable CP-violating effects in the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation unless the mass of $\eta$ is close to the mass of the neutron. We also analyze the interplay between various parameters associated with both $\mathcal{B}$-violation and CP-violation and attempt to disentangle the effects of such parameters. The $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation process accompanied by CP-violation may open a promising avenue for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study an extension of the Standard Model which include a new massive vector field in the fundamental representation of SU(2)_L. The neutral component of the new vector field is a natural dark matter candidate. We compute the Annihilation Cross Section with Sommerfeld Enhancement and the Photon Flux arising from Dark Matter annihilation events. We found that the model exhibits a resonant mass part around the range of 2-10 TeV. This resonance is influenced by the choice of portal Higgs coupling parameter. We show that these predictions can be partially tested by CTA in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of neutrino-electron scattering may provide a viable way to test the non-minimal form of the charged and neutral current weak interactions within a hypothetical near-detector setup for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). Although low-statistics, these processes are clean and provide information complementing the results derived from oscillation studies. They could shed light on the scale of neutrino mass generation in low-scale seesaw schemes.</description>

      <title>How many vector charmonium(-like) states sit in the energy range from $4.2$ to $4.35$ GeV?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years many vector charmonium(-like) states were reported by different electron-positron collider experiments above $4.2$ GeV. However, so far, there not only exists sizable tension in the parameters of those states, but there is also no consensus on the number of the vector states in this energy range. To some extend, this might be caused by the fact that the experimental data were typically analyzed in single channel analyses employing overlapping Breit-Wigner functions, in particular ignoring the effect of opening thresholds. In this study, we focus on the mass range between $4.2$ and $4.35$ GeV, conducting a comprehensive analysis of eight different final states in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation. Our findings demonstrate that, within this mass range, a single vector charmonium-like state, exhibiting properties consistent with a $D_1\bar D$ molecular structure and characterized by a pole location $\sqrt{s_\text{pole}^{Y(4230)}}=\left( 4227{\pm} 3 {-} \frac{i}{2}(50^{+10}_{-5}) \right) \text{MeV}$, can effectively describe all the collected data. This is made possible by allowing for an interference with the well-established vector chamonium $\psi(4160)$ along with the inclusion of the $D_1\bar D$ threshold effect. Moreover, in contrast to experimental analyses, our study reveals that the highly asymmetric total cross sections for $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi\pi$ and $e^+e^-\to J/\psi K\bar K$ around 4230 MeV stem from the same physics, rooted in the approximate SU(3) flavor symmetry of QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of recently found deviations of the experimental data from predictions from QCD factorization for $B_{(s)}\rightarrow D_{(s)}P$ decays, where $P=\{\pi,K\}$, we systematically probe the current status of the SU(3)$_F$ expansion from a fit to experimental branching ratio data without any further theory input. We find that the current data are in agreement with the power counting of the SU(3)$_F$ expansion. While the SU(3)$_F$ limit is excluded at $&gt;5\sigma$, amplitude-level SU(3)$_F$-breaking contributions of $\sim 20\%$ suffice for an excellent description of the data. SU(3)$_F$ breaking is needed in tree ($&gt;5\sigma$) and color-suppressed tree ($2.4\sigma$) diagrams. We are not yet sensitive to SU(3)$_F$ breaking in exchange diagrams. From the underlying SU(3)$_F$ parametrization we predict the unmeasured branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(\overline{B}_s^0\rightarrow \pi^- D^+) = 2 \mathcal{B}(\overline{B}_s^0\rightarrow \pi^0 D^0) = [0.3, 7.2] \times 10^{-6}$ of suppressed decays that can be searched for at the LHCb experiment.</description>

      <title>Improving probes of $hAA$ coupling in the Type-X two Higgs Doublet Model scenario: the crucial role of $\tau$-jet charge identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exotic decay modes of the already discovered 125-GeV scalar into a pair of light pseudoscalars is a good probe of those new physics scenarios where such pseudoscalars exist. Searches in the mass region where the pseudoscalar ($A$) is lighter than 62.5 GeV have yielded null findings so far. No search has yet examined $m_A &gt; 62.5$ GeV where the cross section is suppressed by the off-shell pseudoscalar. We point out a possible enhancement of the sensitivity of probing $hAA$ coupling in the context of a Type-X two Higgs doublet model. We focus on $h\to A A^{(*)} \to 4\tau$, and select events with two same-sign $\tau$-jets along with a pair of same-sign leptons. This enables much more effective background elimination than in the erstwhile proposed channels. Taking two values of the $\tau\tau A$ coupling into account, we obtain limits on the $hAA$ coupling that can be probed at 2$\sigma$ and 3$\sigma$ significance, for $m_A$ ranging up to 85 GeV. For $m_A &lt; 62.5$ GeV, too, we find the probe through our suggested channel exhibits considerable improvement upon the usual $2\mu 2\tau$-based searches conducted at the LHC. Within this region, achieving the reach of $\lambda_{hAA}$ coupling at 3000 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity using our strategy would require approximately $\sim$ 3.6$\times 10^{5}$ fb$^{-1}$ luminosity using conventional $2\mu 2\tau$-based searches.</description>

      <title>One-loop contributions to $WWZ$ from a seesaw variant with radiatively-induced light-neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental confirmation of neutrino mass and mixing disagrees with the picture of the Standard Model, and thus provides a good motivation to look for unknown physics. A seesaw variant in which neutrino masses are radiatively generated, with neutrinos characterized by Majorana fields and where a set of three hypothetical neutral heavy leptons are present, has been considered in the present work. We have calculated, estimated, and analyzed the contributions from virtual light and heavy neutrinos to the gauge vertex $WWZ$, in the context of a future electron-positron collider. We have found that contributions to both $CP$-even and $CP$-odd anomalous couplings are generated. Our estimations indicate that contributions as large as $~10^{-3}$ can be achieved in both cases. This is particularly interesting for the $CP$-odd effects, which are expected to appear in the framework of the Standard Model since the three-loop order, thus being quite suppressed. By considering the expected sensitivity of the International Linear Collider to this gauge vertex, we conclude that these new-physics effects would be within its reach for $e^+e^-$ collisions taking place at a center-of-mass energy of $800\,{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting the hidden-strange pentaquarklike state $N^{*}(2080)$ in the $\pi^{-} p\rightarrow\phi n$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the production of the hidden-strange pentaquarklike state $N^{*}(2080)$ via the $\pi^{-} p$ scattering process is studied by the effective Lagrangian approach. Concretely, we consider the $\rho$ meson exchange of $t$-channel and the nucleon exchange of $u$-channel, which are treated as the background terms, and take into account the contribution of the $N^{*}(2080)$ via the $s$-channel as a signal term. By global fitting of the total and differential cross sections of the $\pi^{-} p\rightarrow\phi n$ process, it is shown that the $N^{*}(2080)$ contributes an obvious peak at the threshold energy point of the differential cross section at the forward angle ($\cos\theta = 1$), which provides clues to the detection of the $N^{*}(2080)$ by the $\pi^{-} p$ scattering process. However, due to the limited accuracy of the experimental data, it is an objective limitation for us to determine the properties of the $N^{*}(2080)$ by the $\pi^{-} p$ scattering process. Therefore, more accurate experimental measurements of the $\pi^{-} p\rightarrow\phi n$ reaction are highly desirable, and we have also proposed that correlation measurements can be performed on J-PARC, AMBER, and future HIKE and HIAF meson beam experiments.</description>

      <title>Alpha radioactivity deep-underground as a probe of axion dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to investigate the time modulation of radioisotope decays deep underground as a method to explore axion dark matter. In this work, we focus on the $\alpha$-decay of heavy isotopes and develop a theoretical description for the $\theta$-dependence of $\alpha$-decay half-lives, which enables us to predict the time variation of $\alpha$-radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. To probe this scenario, we have recently constructed and installed a setup deep underground at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the $\alpha$-decay of Americium-241. This prototype experiment, named RadioAxion-$\alpha$, will allow us to explore a broad range of oscillation's periods, from a micro-second up to one year, thus providing competitive limits on the axion decay constant across 13 orders of magnitude in the axion mass, ranging from $10^{-9}$ eV to $10^{-20}$ eV after one month of data collection, and down to $10^{-22}$ eV after three years.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order electroweak correction to $H\to Z^0\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent observation of the Higgs boson radiative decay into $Z^0$ by {\tt ATLAS} and {\tt CMS} Collaborations, we investigate the next-to-leading-order (NLO) electroweak correction to this rare decay process in Standard Model (SM). Implementing the on-shell renormalization scheme, we find that the magnitude of the NLO electroweak correction may reach $7\%$ of the leading order (LO) prediction, much more significant than that of the NLO QCD correction, which is merely about $0.3\%$. After incorporating the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ correction, the predicted partial width from various $\alpha$ schemes tend to converge to each other. Including both NLO electroweak and QCD corrections, the SM prediction for the branching fraction shifts from the LO value of $(1.40-1.71)\times 10^{-3}$ to $(1.55\pm 0.06)\times 10^{-3}$, considerably lower than the measured value ${\cal B}_{\rm exp}[H\to Z^0\gamma]=(3.4\pm 1.1)\times 10^{-3}$. Resolving this alarming discrepancy clearly calls for further theoretical investigations, and, more importantly, experimental efforts from {\tt HL-LHC} and the prospective Higgs factories such as {\tt CEPC} and {\tt FCC-ee}.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the recent finding that semi-inclusive detections of heavy hadrons exhibit fair stabilization patterns in high-energy resummed distributions against (missing) higher-order corrections, we review and extend our studies on the hadroproduction of light and heavy hadrons tagged in forward and far-forward rapidity ranges. We analyze the NLL/NLO+ behavior of rapidity rates and angular multiplicities via the JETHAD method, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is consistently embodied in the collinear picture. We explore kinematic regions that are within LHC typical acceptances, as well as novel sectors accessible thanks the combined tagging of a far-forward light or heavy hadron at future Forward Physics Facilities and a of central particle at LHC experiments via a precise timing-coincidence setup.</description>

      <title>Single spin asymmetry $ A _{ U L } ^ { \sin ( 2 \phi _ { h } ) }$ in dihadron production in SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19624</link>

Abstract: The paper calculates the helicity-dependent dihadron fragmentation function (DiFF), by extending the dihadron spectator model and examine the single longitudinal spin asymmetry $A^{\sin(2\phi_h)}_{UL}$ from dihadron in semi-inclusive inelastic scattering (SIDIS). This function elucidates the relationship between the longitudinal polarization of the fragmented quark and the transverse momentum of the resulting hadron pairs. A study by the COMPASS collaboration detected a minimal signal in their experimental search for this azimuthal asymmetry in SIDIS. Here, we use the spectator model to calculate the unknown T-odd dihadron fragmentation function $H_1^\perp$. Adopting collinear factorization to describe the data, avoiding the transverse momentum dependent factorization and the associated resummation effects, helping us understand the asymmetry and explaining why the signal is so weak. We involve the approach of transverse momentum dependence in the model calculations, in order to formulate the differential cross sections and the spin asymmetries in terms of the collinear parton distributions and the collinear DiFFs. A transverse momentum factor analysis method was used, in which the transverse momentum of the final hadron pairs was not integrated. The asymmetry of $sin(2\phi_h)$ in COMPASS kinematics was calculated and compared with experimental data. In addition, predictions for the same asymmetry are also presented for HERMES and the Electron Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>On the Metastability of Quantum Fields in Thermal Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the metastability of scalar fields in quantum field theories at finite temperature, focusing on a detailed understanding of the bounce solution. At finite temperature, the bounce solution depends on two variables: the Euclidean time $\tau$ and the spatial radial distance $r$, and it is periodic in the $\tau$ direction. We propose a novel method to determine the bounce that describes transitions in a thermal bath, suitable for numerical calculations. Two types of bounces exist for transitions in the thermal bath: $\tau$-dependent and $\tau$-independent bounces. We apply our method to compute these bounces in several models, including both thin-wall and thick-wall scenarios, to examine their properties. Specifically, we evaluate the critical temperature below which the $\tau$-independent bounce becomes destabilized due to fluctuations, rendering it irrelevant. We demonstrate that in the thick-wall case, the $\tau$-dependent bounce smoothly transitions into the $\tau$-independent one as temperature increases, whereas in the thin-wall case, the transition between the two types of bounces is discontinuous.</description>

      <title>Casimir Energy Stabilization of Standard Model Landscape in Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a realization of dark dimension. We consider the 5D standard model coupling to gravity with one dimension compactified on an orbifold, which is seen as dark dimension of size R. We stabilize the radion by casimir effect wrapping around compact dimension and recover the neutrino mass and 4D cosmological constant with the observed value. Orbifold can lead to a natural resolution of chirality problem in 5D at low energy, which we briefly discussed in the paper. Although we found that the radion mass is too light to survive under solar system tests of GR, several screening mechanisms might give us a solution, for example, Chameleon mechanism.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter with not quite black hole domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of an early cosmological period dominated by primordial 2-2-holes on axion dark matter. The 2-2-holes emerge as a new family of horizonless classical solutions for ultracompact matter distributions in quadratic gravity, a candidate theory of quantum gravity. Thermal 2-2-holes, sourced by relativistic thermal gas, exhibit Hawking-like radiation and fulfill the entropy-area law before they become remnants with almost no radiation. In this paper, we consider the remnant contribution to dark matter (DM) small and adopt the axion DM scenario by the misalignment mechanism. We show that a 2-2-hole domination phase in the evolution of the universe changes the axion mass window obtained from the dark matter abundance constraints. The biggest effect occurs when the remnants have the Planck mass, which is the case for a strongly coupled quantum gravity. The change in abundance constraints for the Planck mass 2-2-hole remnants amounts to that of the primordial black hole (PBH) counterpart. Therefore, since we use the revised constraints from gravitational waves on the initial fraction of 2-2-holes, the results here can also be considered the updated version of the PBH case. As a result, the lower limit on the axion mass is found as $m_a \sim10^{-9}$ eV. Furthermore, the domination scenario itself constrains the remnant mass $ M_{\mathrm{min}}$ considerably. Given that we focus on the pre-BBN domination scenario in order not to interfere with BBN (Big Bang nucleosynthesis) constraints, the remnant mass window becomes $m_{\mathrm{Pl}} \lesssim M_{\mathrm{min}} \lesssim 0.1\;\rm{g}$.</description>

      <title>Fermion states localized on a self-gravitating Skyrmion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate self-gravitating solutions of the Einstein-Skyrme theory coupled to spin-isospin Dirac fermions and consider the dependence of the spectral flow on the effective gravitational coupling constant and on the Yukawa coupling. It is shown that the effects of the backreaction of the fermionic mode may strongly deform the configuration. Depending on the choice of parameters, solutions with positive, negative and zero ADM mass may arise. The occurrence of regular anti-gravitating asymptotically flat solutions with negative ADM mass is caused by the violation of the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Minimal Black Holes and Species Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The species scale provides a lower bound on the shortest possible length that can be probed in gravitational effective theories. It may be defined by the size of the minimal black hole in the theory and, as such, it has recently been given an interpretation along the lines of the celebrated black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we extend this interpretation to the case of charged species. We provide working definitions of minimal black holes for the case of uncharged and charged species constituents. Then, examining the modifications in the thermodynamic properties of near-extremal charged species compared to the uncharged case, we uncover interesting implications for the cosmology of an expanding universe, particularly within the context of the Dark Dimensions Scenario. Finally, we explore possible microscopic constructions in non-supersymmetric string theories in which towers of charged near-extremal species may arise.</description>

      <title>Quintessential interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Abelian Instantons and Monopole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is usually assumed that $4D$ instantons can only arise in non-Abelian theories. In this paper we re-examine this conventional wisdom by explicitly constructing instantons in an Abelian gauge theory: ${\rm QED}_4$ with $N_f$ flavors of Dirac fermions, in the background of a Dirac monopole. This is the low-energy effective field theory for fermions interacting with a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, in the limit where the monopole is infinitely heavy (hence pointlike) and static. This theory, whose non-topological sectors were studied by Rubakov and Callan, has a far richer structure than previously explored. We show how to calculate the topological instanton number, demonstrate the existence of 't Hooft zero modes localized around such instantons, and show how instantons in the path integral provide the underlying mechanism for the Callan-Rubakov process: monopole-catalyzed baryon decay with a cross section that saturates the unitarity bound. Our computation relies on correctly identifying the relevant $2D$ EFT for monopole catalysis as Axial ${\rm QED}_2$ in an effective $AdS_2$ metric.</description>
