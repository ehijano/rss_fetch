      <title>Full 3D nonlinear dynamics of charged and magnetized boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauged boson stars are exotic compact objects that can potentially mimic black holes or magnetized neutron stars in both their gravitational and electromagnetic signatures, offering a compelling new description or even an alternative explanation for various multimessenger phenomena. As a crucial step toward establishing boson stars as viable multimessenger sources, we perform 3D numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system, focusing on both spherical and axisymmetric boson star configurations that vary in their electromagnetic coupling between the neutral case up to values close to the critical case, and so their magnetic field content. For spherical configurations, we consistently find stable solutions. In contrast, for axially symmetric, electrically neutral, magnetized configurations, the dynamics are highly sensitive to the electromagnetic coupling. Configurations with stronger coupling develop a one-armed mode instability, which leads to collapse into black holes. Configurations with weaker coupling undergo a two-stage process: an initial bar-mode instability that triggers a one-armed spiral deformation. This eventually also results in black hole formation, accompanied by emissions of both gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. A similar instability and two-stage pattern is observed in all charged rotating boson stars analyzed. However, all of these configurations become stable when self-interactions are introduced.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problems for Einstein equations in three-dimensional spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze existence and properties of solutions of two-dimensional general relativistic initial data sets with a negative cosmological constant, both on spacelike and characteristic surfaces. A new family of such vacuum, spacelike data parameterised by poles at the conformal boundary at infinity is constructed. We review the notions of global Hamiltonian charges, emphasising the difficulties arising in this dimension, both in a spacelike and characteristic setting. One or two, depending upon the topology, lower bounds for energy in terms of angular momentum, linear momentum, and center of mass are established.</description>

      <title>Imprints of black hole charge on the precessing jet nozzle of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed jet precession period of approximately 11 years for M87* strongly suggests the presence of a supermassive rotating black hole with a tilted accretion disk at the center of the galaxy. By modeling the motion of the tilted accretion disk particle with the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole, we study the effect of charge on the observation of the precession period, thereby exploring the potential of this strong-gravity observation in constraining multiple black hole parameters. Firstly, we study the spherical orbits around a Kerr-Newman black hole and find that their precession periods increase with the charge. Secondly, we utilize the observed M87* jet precession period to constrain the relationship between the spin, charge, and warp radius, specifically detailing the correlations between each pair of these three quantities. Moreover, to further refine constraints on the charge, we explore the negative correlation between the maximum warp radius and charge. A significant result shows that the gap between the maximum warp radii of the prograde and retrograde orbits decrease with the black hole charge. If the warp radius is provided by other observations, different constraints on the charge can be derived for the prograde and retrograde cases. These results suggest that in the era of multi-messenger astronomy, such strong-gravity observation of precessing jet nozzle presents a promising avenue for constraining black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski black hole in the near-Nariai regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigates the massless scalar perturbations of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski black hole considering the general case that admits all nonzero parameters. This case is the most generic black hole spacetime in general relativity, characterized by mass, spin, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, NUT parameter, and cosmological constant. Employing conformal transformations, we can separate the massless scalar field equation and reduce the effective potential in the radial perturbation equation into the P\"oschl--Teller potential in the near-Nariai limit where the event and cosmo-acceleration horizons are close. This allows us to obtain an exact analytical solution of the quasinormal frequency, implying that the decay rate of the field is quantized depending only on the surface gravity of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Power spectrum of scalar fluctuations of the metric during the formation of a scalar black hole in inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use the collapse metric obtained by Carneiro and Fabris to calculate the power spectrum associated to gauge invariant fluctuations of the metric during the formation of a primordial scalar black hole at the end of inflation. We assume that local perturbations in the vacuum energy density can collapse by means of the collapse of the local inflaton field, generating a singularity as shown by Carneiro and Fabris. Employing a representative term of the series expansion of the scale factor we obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for a second order approximation of the scale factor. Thus, the spectrum for scalar black holes obtained can be considered as a correction of the power spectrum of the primordial quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation from Type II Fluctuations with Primordial Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations with large amplitudes and non-Gaussianity. Ref. \cite{Uehara:2024yyp} showed that fluctuations with large amplitudes lead to the formation of type B PBHs, characterized by the existence of the bifurcating trapping horizons, distinct from the more common type A PBHs without a bifurcating trapping horizon. We focus on the local type non-Gaussianity characterized by the curvature perturbation $\zeta$ given by a function of a Gaussian random variable $\zeta_{\rm G}$ as $\beta\zeta=-\ln(1-\beta \zeta_{\rm G})$ with a parameter $\beta$. Then we examine how the non-Gaussianity influences the dynamics and the type of PBH formed, particularly focusing on type II fluctuations, where the areal radius varies non-monotonically with the coordinate radius. Our findings indicate that, for $\beta&gt;-2$, the threshold for distinguishing between type A and type B PBHs decreases with increasing $\beta$ similarly to the threshold for black hole formation. Additionally, for large positive values of $\beta$, the threshold for type B PBHs approaches that for type II fluctuations. We also find that, for a sufficiently large negative value of $\beta\lesssim-4.0$, the threshold value is in the type II region of $\mu$, i.e., there are fluctuations of type II that do not form black holes. Lastly, we calculate the PBH mass for several values of $\beta$. Then we observe that the final mass monotonically increases with the initial amplitude within the parameter region of type A PBHs, which differs from previous analytical expectations.</description>

      <title>Crunch from AdS bubble collapse in unbounded potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with a Minkowski false vacuum and an unbounded (or very deep) true vacuum. We show compelling evidence that an AdS bubble of vanishing total energy, embedded in asymptotically flat spacetime, generically undergoes a spherical collapse which leads to a space-like curvature singularity after the formation of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons. The crunch singularity, which is hided behind an apparent horizon, occurs before the true vacuum is reached, and the existence of a lower bound of the scalar field potential is not a necessary condition for its formation.</description>

      <title>The stability of the greybody factor of Hayward black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the stability of the greybody factor of Hayward black holes by adding a small bump to the effective potential. Considering the greybody factor is a function of frequency, we define the so-called $\mathcal{G}$-factor and $\mathcal{H}$-factor to quantitatively characterize its stability. We study the stability of the greybody factor within the equal amplitude method and the equal energy method, respectively. Here, the equal amplitude method can be directly imposed by fixing the amplitude of the bump, while the equal energy method requires a physical definition of the energy of the bump with the assistance of hyperboloidal framework. For both the equal amplitude method and the equal energy method, when the location of the bump is close to the event horizon of the black hole, and the closer it is to the peak of original potential, the larger are $\mathcal{G}$-factor and $\mathcal{H}$-factor, and they are bounded by the magnitude of the amplitude or the energy. More importantly, for the equal amplitude method, two factors tend to a specific value as the location of the bump increases. In contrast, for the equal energy method, two factors converge to zero as the location of the bump increases. Notably, the $\mathcal{G}$-factor and the $\mathcal{H}$-factor are insensitive to the regular parameter of Hayward black hole. Therefore, our results indicate that the greybody factor is stable under specific perturbations.</description>

      <title>Gravity from thermodynamics in vacuum: Lorentz invariance and the role of Bel-Robinson tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of local causal horizons have been shown to encode the information necessary to derive the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We have previously shown that, in the presence of matter, this derivation further implies quantum phenomenological corrections to gravitational dynamics. Herein, we study whether similar corrections also occur in vacuum. We show that, under the assumptions of locality and local Lorentz invariance of physics, the vacuum dynamics is prescribed by the Einstein equations. We also discuss an alternative paradigm which assumes the existence of a preferred direction of time (much like in Einstein-aether or Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity). Then, we find an modified gravitational dynamics in which Ricci curvature is sourced by Bel-Robinson super-energy.</description>

      <title>Modified Landauer principle according to Tsallis entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landauer principle establishes a lower bound in the amount of energy that should be dissipated in the erasure of one bit of information. The specific value of this dissipated energy is tightly related to the definition of entropy. In this article, we present a generalization of the Landauer principle based on the Tsallis entropy. Some consequences resulting from such a generalization are discussed. These consequences include the modification to the mass ascribed to one bit of information, the generalization of the Landauer principle to the case when the system is embedded in a gravitational field, and the number of bits radiated in the emission of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Mimicking wormholes in Born-Infeld electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the evolution of linear perturbations on top of a background solution of a general nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This evolution can be described in terms of two effective metrics, and we analyse under what conditions they are conformally related, so that they can be regarded as analogue models of non-trivial gravitational fields in the eikonal approximation. This is the case of Born-Infeld theory. For the background created by a static point electric charge in the Born-Infeld theory, the effective metric describes a wormhole geometry for light rays. Depending on the impact parameter, incoming light rays are either scattered to infinity or approach the wormhole slowing down their pace until they hit the charge at vanishing speed. The same effective wormhole geometry is obtained for a magnetic monopole and a dyon and we relate it to the duality invariance of Born-Infeld electromagnetism. Finally, we analyse the scalar Dirac-Born-Infeld theory and show that the effective wormhole geometry is not generated by a particle with scalar charge.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Effects in Black Hole Ringdown Made Simple: Quasi-Normal Modes as Adiabatic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear nature of general relativity manifests prominently throughout the merger of two black holes, from the inspiral phase to the final ringdown. Notably, the quasi-normal modes generated during the ringdown phase display significant nonlinearities. We show that these nonlinear effects can be effectively captured by zooming in on the photon ring through the Penrose limit. Specifically, we model the quasi-normal modes as null particles trapped in unstable circular orbits around the black holes and show that they can be interpreted as adiabatic modes, perturbations that are arbitrarily close to large diffeomorphisms. This enables the derivation of a simple analytical expression for the QNM nonlinearities for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes which reproduces well the existing numerical results.</description>

      <title>$\tilde\xi$-attractors in metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. In fact, cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between infall lookback time and log binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites, as well as of the galaxies previously accreted by the Milky Way, which can, for the first time, be compared to cosmological simulations. We find that the infall lookback time vs. binding energy relation found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events, once the simulated MW total mass within 21 kpc is rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses, in good agreement with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this re-scaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them have been accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also find that some cosmological simulations show too dynamically hot sub-halo systems when compared to identified MW substructures, leading to overestimate the impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>

      <title>Emergent Geometry from Quantum Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrying the insights of conditional probability to the quantum realm is notoriously difficult due to the non-commutative nature of quantum observables. Nevertheless, conditional expectations on von Neumann algebras have played a significant role in the development of quantum information theory, and especially the study of quantum error correction. In quantum gravity, it has been suggested that conditional expectations may be used to implement the holographic map algebraically, with quantum error correction underlying the emergence of spacetime through the generalized entropy formula. However, the requirements for exact error correction are almost certainly too strong for realistic theories of quantum gravity. In this note, we present a relaxed notion of quantum conditional expectation which implements approximate error correction. We introduce a generalization of Connes' spatial theory adapted to completely positive maps, and derive a chain rule allowing for the non-commutative factorization of relative modular operators into a marginal and conditional part, constituting a quantum Bayes' law. This allows for an exact quantification of the information gap occurring in the data processing inequality for arbitrary quantum channels. When applied to algebraic inclusions, this also provides an approach to factorizing the entropy of states into a sum of terms which, in the gravitational context, may be interpreted as a generalized entropy. We illustrate that the emergent area operator is fully non-commutative rather than central, except under the conditions of exact error correction. We provide some comments on how this result may be used to construct a fully algebraic quantum extremal surface prescription and to probe the quantum nature of black holes.</description>

      <title>Smooth extremal horizons are the exception, not the rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the general charged, rotating black hole in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory has a singular extremal limit. Only the known analytic solutions with exactly zero charge or zero angular momenta have smooth extremal horizons. When the two angular momenta are not equal and both are scaled to zero, the solution approaches a new family of static, nonspherical extremal black holes. We also consider general black holes in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, and show that they also have singular extremal limits except for one special value of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term (the one fixed by supergravity). Combining this with earlier results showing that extremal black holes have singular horizons in four-dimensional general relativity with small higher derivative corrections, and in anti-de Sitter space with perturbed boundary conditions, one sees that smooth extremal horizons are indeed the exception and not the rule.</description>

      <title>Phase Space of Binary Black Holes from Gravitational Wave Observations to Unveil its Formation History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources offer a valuable window to the physical processes that govern the formation of binary compact objects (BCOs). However, deciphering such information from GW data is substantially challenging due to the difficulty in mapping from the space of observation to the space of numerous theoretical models. We introduce the concept of BCO Phase-Space that connects the observable space to the evolution trajectories of the BCO formation channels with cosmic time and apply it to the third GW transient catalog (GWTC-3) that brings new insights into probable astrophysical formation scenarios of nearly $90$ events. Our study reveals that two events, GW190425 and GW230529, show an overlap with a $\texttt{BCO Phase Space}$ trajectory of the same formation channel arising from a sub-solar mass black hole scenario that has grown into a higher mass by accretion, hinting towards the common primordial origin of both these sources. Though the actual formation channel is yet to be confirmed, with the availability of more GW events, the $\texttt{BCO Phase Space}$ can delve into distinguishing features of different formation channels for both astrophysical and primordial origin and opens the possibility of bringing new and deeper insights on the formation and evolution of BCOs across all observable masses over most of the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Initial Data Sets with Vanishing Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Special Relativity, massless objects are characterized as either vacuum states or as radiation propagating at the speed of light. This distinction extends to General Relativity for asymptotically flat initial data sets (IDS) \((M^n, g, k)\), where vacuum is represented by slices of Minkowski space, and radiation is modeled by slices of \(pp\)-wave spacetimes. In contrast, we demonstrate that asymptotically hyperboloidal IDS with zero mass must embed isometrically into Minkowski space, with no possible IDS configurations modeling radiation in this setting. Our result holds under the most general assumptions. The proof relies on precise decay estimates for spinors on level sets of spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>New Physics Hiding at the Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is field space infinite? If not, it either loops back on itself or ends altogether. Periodic boundary conditions are of course familiar, but field space endpoints--which appear in real-world systems--are far less explored. In this paper we argue that boundaries in field space are generic, radiatively stable structures that allow for new physics at very low scales not ruled out by experiment. Such boundaries are delocalized in field space from the vacuum, so they can only be accessed by coherent fields or high multiplicity processes, both of which are weakly constrained observationally. Low multiplicity interactions do not detect the boundary and instead perceive a "mirage cutoff" that is parametrically higher than the true cutoff of the theory. Hence, field space boundaries are deformations of the standard model that are Lorentz invariant, local, unitary at low energies, and experimentally unconstrained. We comment on the possibility of field space boundaries on the long-range force carriers and the Higgs, as well as possible implications for the hierarchy problem.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the recently discovered family of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant potentials describing inflationary $\alpha$-attractors. These potentials have an inflationary plateau consisting of the fundamental domain and its images fully covering the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane. Meanwhile, the lower part of the half-plane is covered by an infinitely large number of ridges, which, at first glance, are too sharp to support inflation. However, we show that this apparent sharpness is just an illusion created by hyperbolic geometry, and each of these ridges is physically equivalent to the inflationary plateau in the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves from logarithmic non-Gaussianity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black hole (PBH) based on numerical relativity simulations and peak theory as well as the corresponding scalar induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals in the presence of \emph{logarithmic non-Gaussianities} which has recently been confirmed in a wide class of inflation models. Through numerical calculations, we find certain parameter spaces of the critical thresholds for the type A PBH formation and reveal a maximum critical threshold value. We also find that there is a region where no PBH is produced from type II fluctuations contrary to a previous study. We then confirm that SIGW signals originated from the logarithmic non-Gaussianity are detectable in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna if PBHs account for whole dark matter. Finally, we discuss the SIGW interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background reported by the recent pulsar timing array observations. We find that PBH overproduction is a serious problem for most of the parameter space, while this tension might still be alleviated in the non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Diving into a multi-band holographic superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the interior structure of a multi-band holographic superconductor model. We focus on the holographic superconductor system with two scalar fields which correspond to two s-wave order parameters in the dual condensed matter system. With two s-wave order parameters, the boundary system has more interesting behaviors which can also be reflected in black hole interior structure. We find the Einstein-Rosen bridge collapse and Josephson oscillations of two scalar fields inside the horizon. For the region near the singularity, we find that the metric still presents Kasner form and there is also Kasner transition behavior. However, when two scalar fields coexist, the Kasner exponents and Kasner transition formula will be different from the single scalar field case. The different interior structures between multi-band holographic superconductor and single-band holographic superconductor we find in this work further confirms that the black hole interior is important to reflect the properties of dual condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced ALP Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative gravitational effects induce explicit global symmetry breaking terms within axion models. These exponentially suppressed terms in the potential give a mass contribution to the axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work we investigate this scenario with a scalar field charged under a global $U(1)$ symmetry and having a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Given the exponential dependence, the ALP can retain a mass spanning a wide range, which can act as a dark matter component. We specify pre-inflationary and post-inflationary production mechanisms of these ALPs, with the former from the misalignment mechanism and the latter from both the misalignment and cosmic-string decay. We identify the allowed parameter ranges that explain the dark matter abundance for both a general inflation case and a case where the radial mode scalar drives inflation, each in metric and Palatini formalisms. We show that the ALP can be the dominant component of the dark matter in a wide range of its mass, $m_{a} \in [10^{-21}~\mathrm{eV},\, \mathrm{TeV}]$, depending on the inflationary scenario and the $U(1)$ breaking scale. These results indicate that ALPs can be responsible for our dark matter abundance within a setup purely from non-perturbative gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>A study on the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario through quadrics of kinetic energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed description of the asymptotic behaviour in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario is presented through a simple geometric picture. The Lagrangian version of the dynamics governed by the BKL equations is described in terms of trajectories inside a conical subset of the corresponding space of the generalised velocities. The calculations confirm that the initial conditions of decreasing volume inevitably result in total collapse, while oscillations along paths reflecting from a hyperboloid, similar to Kasner's solutions, occur on the way. The exact solution, found in our previous work, proves to be the only one that shrinks to a point along a differentiable path. Therefore, its instability means that the collapse is always chaotic. The collapse of the universe along asymptotics of exact Kasner's solutions is proved to be impossible for solutions of the BKL equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct series of solutions for the Kerr-type rotating black hole with non-trivial matter in flat and (A)dS backgrounds. Symmetry arguments and singularity analysis in the proposed black hole models fix the free parameters of the solutions, and the study of popular energy conditions makes it possible to impose constraints on configuration and field content of external matter. The resulted geometry of spacetimes is featured by a special type singularity in the north and south pole directions, inducing the bipolar outflow of particles from black holes. As a step toward the construction of a non-stationary rotating black hole solution in the presence of matter, we explore the zero angular momentum limit of the constructed metrics. The use of the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates allows us to find a generalization of the proposed construction to the Vaidya-type black hole. Finally, employing the Newman-Janis algorithm, we find the corresponding generalization of the Kerr-Vaidya black hole solution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics from General Relativity and the Quantum Friedmann Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the recently introduced linear form of the Friedmann equations corresponds to the first-order WKB expansion of a quantum cosmological equation, indicating that both General Relativity (GR) contains aspects of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and that GR itself is part of a more general theory. Solutions of this quantum Friedmann equation are built in terms of a quantum scale factor that encapsulates the quantum effects on a free-falling particle. The quantum-modified scale factor reshapes the dynamics of the universe, removing the singularity due to the vanishing of the scale factor. A detailed example within the radiation-dominated context illustrates how these quantum solutions connect to Seiberg-Witten theory, recently applied to black holes, and incorporate resurgence phenomena and complex metrics as developed by Kontsevich, Segal, and Witten. As a result, this reveals an invariance of time parametrization under $\Gamma(2)$ transformations of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Large Field Polynomial Inflation in Palatini $f(R,\phi)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Palatini formalism to investigate the dynamics of large-field inflation using a renormalizable polynomial inflaton potential in the context of $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. Assuming instant reheating, we make a comparative analysis of large-field polynomial inflation (PI). We first consider the minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in $R$ gravity, and then we continue with the minimally and non-minimally coupled inflaton in $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. We scan the parameter space for the inflationary predictions ($n_s$ and $r$) consistent with the Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results as well as the sensitivity forecast of the future CMB-S4 and depict the compliant regions in the $\phi_0-\beta$ plane where $\phi_0$ and $\beta$ are two parameters of polynomial inflation model which control the saddle point of the potential and the flatness in the vicinity of this point respectively. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space aligns with the observational data.</description>

      <title>(Quasi-)normal modes of rotating black holes and new solitons in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalar field (quasi-)normal modes of recently derived rotating black holes within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point in five dimensions. We also examine the mode spectrum of these probes on new static gravitational solitons. These solitons, featuring a regular center, are constructed from static black holes with gravitational hair via a double analytic continuation. By imposing ingoing boundary conditions at the horizons of rotating black holes, ensuring regularity at the soliton centers, and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at infinity, we obtain numerical spectra for the rotating black holes and solitons. For static black holes, we demonstrate analytically that the imaginary part of the mode frequencies is negative. Our analysis of the massless Klein-Gordon equation on five-dimensional geometries reveals an infinite family of gapped, massive three-dimensional Klein-Gordon fields, despite the presence of a non-compact extended direction. For the static solitons, the frequencies are real and non-equispaced, whereas in the rotating black holes, counter-rotating modes are absorbed more quickly, and the imaginary part of the co-rotating modes approaches zero as extremality is approached. Additionally, we show that both the rotating black holes and solitons can be equipped with non-trivial torsion, leading to a novel branch of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use simple performance metrics to assess the science capabilities of future ground-based gravitational-wave detector networks -- composed of A+ or Voyager upgrades to the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories and proposed next generation observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. These metrics refer to coalescences of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and binary black holes (BBHs) and include: (i) network detection efficiency and detection rate of cosmological sources as a function of redshift, (ii) signal-to-noise ratios and the accuracy with which intrinsic and extrinsic parameters would be measured, and (iii) enabling multimessenger astronomy with gravitational waves by accurate 3D localization and early warning alerts. We further discuss the science enabled by the small population of rare and extremely loud events. While imminent upgrades will provide impressive advances in all these metrics, next generation observatories will deliver an improvement of an order-of-magnitude or more in most metrics. In fact, a network containing two or three such facilities will detect half of all the BNS and BBH mergers up to a redshift of $z=1$ and $z=20$, respectively, give access to hundreds of BNSs and ten thousand BBHs with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 100, readily localize hundreds to thousands of mergers to within $1\,{\rm deg^2}$ on the sky and better than 10% in luminosity distance, respectively, and consequently, enable mutlimessenger astronomy through follow-up surveys in the electromagnetic spectrum several times a week. Such networks will further shed light on potential cosmological merger populations and detect an abundance of high-fidelity BNS and BBH signals which will allow investigations of the high-density regime of matter at an unprecedented level and enable precision tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna: Mission Studies and Science Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed array of next-generation inertial sensors to monitor the response of the Moon to gravitational waves (GWs). Given the size of the Moon and the expected noise produced by the lunar seismic background, the LGWA would be able to observe GWs from about 1 mHz to 1 Hz. This would make the LGWA the missing link between space-borne detectors like LISA with peak sensitivities around a few millihertz and proposed future terrestrial detectors like Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer. In this article, we provide a first comprehensive analysis of the LGWA science case including its multi-messenger aspects and lunar science with LGWA data. We also describe the scientific analyses of the Moon required to plan the LGWA mission.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal geodesics in closed FLRW cosmological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study geodesics in Friedmann-Lema{\^\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological models and give the full set of solutions. For azimuthal geodesics, in a closed universe, we give the angular distance travelled by a test particle moving along such a geodesic during one cycle of expansion and re-collapse of the universe. We extend previous results regarding the path followed by light rays to the two-fluid case, also including a cosmological constant, as well as to massive test particles. Our work contains various new results and explicit formulae, often using special functions which naturally appear in this setting.</description>

      <title>Generalized Chern-Pontryagin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $f(R, {}^*RR)$. Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for a particular model, $f(R, {}^*RR)=R+\beta ({}^*RR)^2$, considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating metric and first-order perturbations of G\"{o}del-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameter $L$, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, G\"{o}del-type metrics hold unperturbed. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields: $\Phi$, a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second, $\vartheta$, a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field $\vartheta$ emerges coupled with the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $\vartheta {}^*RR$, which is nothing more than Chern-Simons term.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the conformal limit inside rotating neutron stars: Implications to modified theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the supranuclear densities achieved inside a neutron star, matter may exhibit extreme properties. In particular, it may be the case that a suitable average of the speed of sound squared exceeds the so-called conformal limit, i.e., $\langle c_s^2 \rangle &gt; 1/3$, a condition that is equivalent to the positiveness of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor at the stellar center. This property, that holds for highly compact neutron stars obeying many (but not any) realistic equations of state, would turn these objects into interesting laboratories for tests of several scalar extensions of general relativity. In this paper, we investigate how rapid rotation influences the superconformality of the averaged speed of sound squared and modified gravity effects that depend thereupon, paying particular attention to scalar-tensor theories prone to the spontaneous scalarization effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. We find that the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone coincide for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We also show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar perturbations in Kerr Black Holes: near extremal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of massive scalar perturbations in Kerr black holes using the isomonodromic method. For arbitrary scalar masses $M \mu$ and black hole spins $a/M$, we numerically determine the quasinormal frequencies for various orbital $\ell$, azimuthal $m$, and overtone $n$ numbers. In particular, we derive an analytic expression for frequencies of the zero-damping modes near the extremal limit $a/M \rightarrow 1$. For $\ell=m=1$, we reveal that the fundamental mode becomes a damped mode (rather than a zero-damping mode) if the scalar field is sufficiently heavy. By exploring the parameter space, we find numerical evidence for level-crossing between the longest-living mode and the first overtone at an exceptional point $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a series of exact solutions to Einstein-Maxwell equation under nonlinear electrodynamics theory (NED), which are considered as a natural extension of the dyonic RN solution. Our results are based on a general premise demanding a spherically symmetric spacetime but with few restrictions on the specific form of the EM action. We discuss some of its properties including ADM mass, quasi-local mass, asymptotic behavior, energy condition and so on. We study the EM-gravity coupled perturbation in this spacetime using Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. We also generalize the former formula computing energy and angular momentum flux from the black hole horizon to study the super radiance of the Dirac field in this spacetime.</description>

      <title>The (1+3)-dimensional 'quantum principle of relativity' is Einstein's principle of relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the $(1+3)$-dimensional `superboost' operators, proposed in Dragan and Ekert's most recent work on superluminal reference frames \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, are simply the canonical Lorentz boosts, expressed in nonstandard notation. Their $(1+3)$-dimensional `superflip', which is claimed to interchange time and space dimensions for a superluminal observer, travelling with infinite speed, is equivalent to applying the identity operator together with an arbitrary relabeling. Physically, it corresponds to staying put within the canonical rest frame, then renaming space as `time' and time as `space'. We conclude that their extension of the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed in earlier work on $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes \cite{Dragan:2019grn}, to ordinary Minkowski space \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, is simply Einstein's principle of relativity, proposed in 1905.</description>

      <title>Proton decay in de Sitter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of proton in the de Sitter environment is governed by the temperature $T=H/\pi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This temperature is twice larger than the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. This demonstrates the physical difference of two processes. The temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the proton decay rate in the local process which takes well inside the cosmological horizon. While the Gibbons-Hawking temperature can be related to the processes which involve the Hawking photons or other particles radiated from the cosmological horizon. The same temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the radiation of electron-positron pairs by positron or by other object in the de Sitter environment. Creation of matter and its thermalization in the de Sitter heat bath leads to the energy exchange between matter and quantum vacuum and finally to the decay of the de Sitter state towards the Minkowski vacuum. The lesson for the Unruh effect is also discussed. One may expect the similar separation of effects governed by two different temperatures: the effects related to the Rindler horizon with the Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=a/2\pi$ and the local radiation with $T=a/\pi=2T_{\rm U}$.</description>

      <title>Effects of black hole environments on extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters (EMRHEs) around the supermassive black holes will be observable at the future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji. Here we consider such EMRHEs in the presence of surrounding matter distribution including baryonic accretion disk and dark matter (DM) spike, and estimate their effects on the orbital evolution and GW waveforms. We find that large possible impacts come from the gravitational potential of accretion disk, while the influence of DM spike is small. We also illustrate that environments can leave distinctive imprints on the GW waveforms, but resolving such modifications is found to be challenging for LISA-like detectors in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, we present the formal derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, $S\sim A ^{1+\delta/2}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq 1$ is the Barrow exponent and $A$ is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent $\delta$ by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$, we set the observational bound on $\left| \frac{\delta T_f} {T_f }\right|$. We find out that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ should be around $ \delta \simeq 0.01$ in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$ in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent $\delta$ (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study four classical tests of Schwarzschild space-time with Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. We performed detailed calculations of the first-order corrections induced by the non-commutative parameter on planetary orbital precession, light deflection, radar wave delay, and gravitational redshift. The study showed that the impact of the non-commutative parameter on timelike geodesics is significantly greater than its effect on null geodesics. Using precise experimental observations, the allowable range for the non-commutative parameter is ultimately constrained within $\Theta\leq0.067579~\mathrm{m}^{2}$, which is given by Mercury's orbital precession. This result aligns with the view that $\sqrt{\Theta}$ is on the order of the Planck length. Moreover, the constrained parameter range exceeds the Planck scale by a significant margin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate Friedmann's equations as second-order linear differential equations. This is done using techniques related to the Schwarzian derivative that selects the $\beta$-times $t_\beta:=\int^t a^{-2\beta}$, where $a$ is the scale factor. In particular, it turns out that Friedmann's equations are equivalent to the eigenvalue problems $$ O_{1/2} \Psi=\frac{\Lambda}{12}\Psi \ , \qquad O_1 a =\frac{\Lambda}{3} a \ , $$ which is suggestive of a measurement problem. $O_{\beta}(\rho,p)$ are space-independent Klein-Gordon operators, depending only on energy density and pressure, and related to the Klein-Gordon Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The $O_\beta$'s are also independent of the spatial curvature, labeled by $k$, and absorbed in $$ \Psi=\sqrt a e^{\frac{i}{2}\sqrt{k}\eta} \ . $$ The above pair of equations is the unique possible linear form of Friedmann's equations unless $k=0$, in which case there are infinitely many pairs of linear equations. Such a uniqueness just selects the conformal time $\eta\equiv t_{1/2}$ among the $t_\beta$'s, which is the key to absorb the curvature term. An immediate consequence of the linear form is that it reveals a new symmetry of Friedmann's equations in flat space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the second order energy density perturbation $\delta^{(2)}$ induced by small-scale Gaussian and local-type non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbations. The relative abundance of primordial black hole is calculated in terms of the probability density function of total energy density perturbation $\delta_r=\delta^{(1)}+\frac{1}{2}\delta^{(2)}$. The effects of second order density perturbation greatly reduce the upper bounds of small-scale power spectra of primordial curvature perturbations by one to two orders of magnitude. For log-normal primordial power spectrum, its amplitude $A_{\zeta}$ is constrained to be about $A_{\zeta}\sim 3\times10^{-3}$. And for local-type non-Gaussianity with $f_{\mathrm{NL}}=10$, the upper bound of $A_{\zeta}$ is about $2.5\times10^{-4}$.</description>

Specifically, we refine the correspondence between the projected Einstein equations of gravity with matter and the Raychaudhuri-Damour-Navier-Stokes (RDNS) equations of relativistic hydrodynamics. For a general configuration of gravity with matter we obtain additional terms in the hydrodynamic equations, which include very specific combinations of the contracted logarithmic derivatives of a parameter (the regularization function) determining the proximity of a stretched membrane to the black hole horizon. Nevertheless, direct computations of the new terms for exact (Schwarzschild and Kerr) black hole solutions prompt the standard form of the RDNS equations, due to the non-expanding horizon property of these solutions. Therefore, the reduction of the extended RDNS equations to their classical form may be viewed as an additional consistency condition in the exact black hole solutions hydrodynamics, and may serve as a non-trivial test for various viable approximations of spacetime metrics. We compare in detail the Parikh-Wilczek Membrane Approach with the Gourgoulhon-Jaramillo method of a null-hypersurface description, as well as give the link of the obtained results to our previous work on the Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>1/c deformations of AdS$_3$ boundary conditions and the Dym hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel family of boundary conditions for AdS$_3$ General Relativity, constructed through a polynomial expansion in negative integer powers of the Brown-Henneaux central charge. The associated dynamics is governed by the Dym hierarchy of integrable equations. It is shown that the infinite set of Dym conserved charges generates an abelian asymptotic symmetry group. Additionally, these boundary conditions encompass black hole solutions, whose thermodynamic properties are examined.</description>

      <title>Absence of antisymmetric tensor fields : Clue from Starobinsky model of f(R) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the surprising aspects of the present Universe, is the absence of any noticeable observable effects of higher-rank antisymmetric tensor fields in any natural phenomena. Here, we address the possible explanation of the absence of the higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We explore the cosmological evolution of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with higher curvature term in a general $f(R)$ gravity model $f (R) = R +\alpha_n R^n$. We show that while different cosmological parameters mimic standard behaviour at different epochs for different forms of higher curvature gravity (i.e. different values of n ), only Starobinsky model (n = 2) gives a natural justification for the invisibility of the signatures of the massless modes of higher rank antisymmetric fields. In contrast, for other models ($n\neq2$), despite their agreement with standard cosmology, the scalar degree of freedom induces an enhancement in the coupling of the antisymmetric fields and thereby contradicts the observation. The result does not change even with the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant. Thus, our result reveals that among different $f(R)$ models, Starobinsky model successfully explains the suppression of the massless modes of higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields leading to their invisibility in the present universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to describe loop corrections of gravitation is a fundamental challenge in the quantization of Einstein gravity. In this paper, we give it a try in UV-free scheme, including one-loop propagator and two-loop vertex, and the results are effective for graviton loops. This indicates that both loops of the renormalizable Standard Model and the non-renormalizable Einstein gravity can be described in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a nonminimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main limitation for preinflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with grand unified theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We propose a mechanism that explicitly breaks PQ symmetry via nonminimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the nonminimal coupling, before it moves to its true $CP$-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA, DMRadio or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Bulk Fields: No-Go Conjectures for Braneworld Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a series of no-go conjectures that impose rigorous constraints on the localization of bulk fields in braneworld scenarios, specifically affecting gauge and spinor fields within five-dimensional spacetimes. Our approach differs from traditional methods as it does not rely on specific equations of motion, making our results broadly applicable across various braneworld models. These no-go conditions reveal fundamental limitations in field localization, challenging the feasibility of embedding fields on the brane. For instance, our analysis demonstrates that existing models fail to achieve consistent localization for gauge and spinor fields. Additionally, one of our conditions indicates that the effective Lagrangian on the brane cannot exhibit conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference post DESI DR1 BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we implement Gaussian process regression to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe in a model-agnostic manner, using the Pantheon-Plus SN-Ia compilation in combination with two different BAO measurements (SDSS-IV and DESI DR1). In both the reconstructions, the $\Lambda$CDM model is always included in the 95\% confidence intervals. We find evidence that the DESI LRG data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ is not an outlier within our model-independent framework. We study the $\mathcal{O}m$-diagnostics and the evolution of the total equation of state (EoS) of our universe, which hint towards the possibility of a quintessence-like dark energy scenario with a very slowly varying EoS, and a phantom-crossing in higher $z$. The entire exercise is later complemented by considering two more SN-Ia compilations - DES-5YR and Union3 - in combination with DESI BAO. Reconstruction with the DESI BAO + DES-5YR SN data sets predicts that the $\Lambda$CDM model lies outside the 3$\sigma$ confidence levels, whereas with DESI BAO + Union3 data, the $\Lambda$CDM model is always included within 1$\sigma$. We also report constraints on $H_0 r_d$ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the pre-recombination physics. Our results point towards an $\approx$ 2$\sigma$ discrepancy between the DESI + Pantheon-Plus and DESI + DES-5YR data sets, which calls for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Constraining small-scale primordial magnetic fields from the abundance of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of magnetic fields in the early universe affects the cosmological processes, leading to the distinct signature, which allows constraining their properties and the genesis mechanisms. In this study, we revisit the method to constrain the amplitude of the magnetic fields on small scales in the radiation-dominated era from the abundance of primordial black holes. Constraints in the previous work were based on the fact that the density perturbations sourced by stronger magnetic fields become large enough to gravitationally collapse to form PBHs. However, we demonstrate that this picture is incomplete because magnetic fields also increase the threshold value of the density contrast required for PBH formation. The increase in threshold density contrast is more pronounced on smaller scales, and in extreme cases, it might even prevent PBH production despite the presence of significant magnetic field. Taking into account the relevant physical effects on the magnetized overdense region, we establish an upper-limit on the amplitude of comoving magnetic fields, approximately $0.13-0.15 {\rm \mu G}$ at a scale of $10^{17} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we compare our constraints with various small-scale probes.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Interacting Dark Energy Models from the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and DES Supernovae Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent results from the first year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full five-year observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM for the IDE model with $Q=\beta H_0\rho_{\rm de}$ reaches the $3\sigma$ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with $Q\propto\rho_{\rm c}$, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient $\Gamma$. The IDE model with $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ yields $\beta=0.0003\pm 0.0011$, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>

      <title>T-duality on Almost Hermitian Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to string sigma model whose target space is a T-dualized system from an integrable bi-hermitian space with isometry. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized almost complex structures keep integrable even though they become no longer covariantly constant. We also observe that the form of $H$-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unitarity through PT symmetry in Quantum Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theories described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are known to possess strictly positive energy eigenvalues and exhibit unitary time evolution if the Hamiltonian is symmetric under discrete parity and time (PT) transformation. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum quadratic gravity, a theory that generally violates unitarity when viewed as a Hermitian quantum field theory, can be complex-deformed into such a PT-symmetric theory with an action that consists of a ghost-less Hermitian free part and non-Hermitian interactions. Paying special attention to the gauge symmetry present in the theory, we quantize in the covariant operator formalism after suggesting how the framework might be extended to the pseudo-Hermitian picture. We find compelling evidence that the resulting quantum theory possesses a unitary inner product and a sensible interpretation of quantum probability, thus avoiding the ghost problem present in the Hermitian formulation of quadratic gravity.</description>
