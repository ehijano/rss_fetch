      <title>Classical Limits of Hilbert Bimodules as Symplectic Dual Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert bimodules are morphisms between C*-algebraic models of quantum systems, while symplectic dual pairs are morphisms between Poisson geometric models of classical systems. Both of these morphisms preserve representation-theoretic structures of the relevant types of models. Previously, it has been shown that one can functorially associate certain symplectic dual pairs to Hilbert bimodules through strict deformation quantization. We show that, in the inverse direction, strict deformation quantization also allows one to functorially take the classical limit of a Hilbert bimodule to reconstruct a symplectic dual pair.</description>

      <title>What Can Quantum Information Theory Offer to Quantum Chemistry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is the ultimate goal of this work to foster synergy between quantum chemistry and the flourishing field of quantum information theory. For this, we first translate quantum information concepts such as entanglement and correlation into the context of quantum chemical systems. In particular, we establish two conceptually distinct perspectives on `electron correlation' leading to a notion of orbital and particle correlation. We then demonstrate that particle correlation equals total orbital correlation minimized over all orbital bases. Accordingly, particle correlation resembles the minimal, thus intrinsic, complexity of many-electron wave functions while orbital correlation quantifies their complexity relative to a basis. We illustrate these concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic correlation complexity in molecular systems, which also manifests the crucial link between the two correlation pictures. Our results provide theoretical justification for the long-favored natural orbitals for simplifying electronic structures, and open new pathways for developing more efficient approaches towards the electron correlation problem.</description>

      <title>On the structure of W-algebras in type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate and prove examples of a conjecture which describes the W-algebras in type A as successive quantum Hamiltonian reductions of affine vertex algebras associated with several hook-type nilpotent orbits. This implies that the affine coset subalgebras of hook-type W-algebras are building blocks of the W-algebras in type A. In the rational case, it turns out that the building blocks for the simple quotients are provided by the minimal series of the regular W-algebras. In contrast, they are provided by singlet-type extensions of W-algebras at collapsing levels which are irrational. In the latter case, several new sporadic isomorphisms between different W-algebras are established.</description>

      <title>Elliptic billiard with harmonic potential: Classical description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical dynamics of the isotropic two-dimensional harmonic oscillator confined by an elliptic hard wall is discussed. The interplay between the harmonic potential with circular symmetry and the boundary with elliptical symmetry does not spoil the separability in elliptic coordinates; however, it generates non-trivial energy and momentum dependencies in the billiard. We analyze the equi-momentum surfaces in the parameters space and classify the kinds of motion the particle can have in the billiard. The winding numbers and periods of the rotational and librational trajectories are analytically calculated and numerically verified. A remarkable finding is the possibility of having degenerate rotational trajectories with the same energy but different second constant of motion and different caustics and periods. The conditions to get these degenerate trajectories are analyzed. Similarly, we show that obtaining two different rotational trajectories with the same period and second constant of motion but different energy is possible.</description>

      <title>Free fermions, neutrality and modular transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a view towards higher-spin applications, we study the partition function of a free complex fermion in 2d CFT, restricted to the neutral (zero fermion number) sector. This restriction leads to a partial theta function with a combinatoric interpretation in terms of Dyson's crank of a partition. More crucially, this partition function can be expressed in terms of a q-hypergeometric function with quantum modular properties. This allows us to find its high-temperature asymptotics, including subleading terms which agree with, but also go beyond, what one obtains by imposing neutrality thermodynamically through a chemical potential. We evaluate the asymptotic density of states for this neutral partition function, including the first few subleading terms. Our results should be extendable to more fermions, as well as to higher-spin chemical potentials, which would be of relevance to the higher-spin/minimal model correspondence.</description>

      <title>Monge-Ampere Geometry and Vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to Monge-Ampere geometry based on techniques from higher symplectic geometry. Our work is motivated by the application of Monge-Ampere geometry to the Poisson equation for the pressure that arises for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Whilst this equation constitutes an elliptic problem for the pressure, it can also be viewed as a non-linear partial differential equation connecting the pressure, the vorticity, and the rate-of-strain. As such, it is a key diagnostic relation in the quest to understand the formation of vortices in turbulent flows. We study this equation via an associated (higher) Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle to the configuration space of the fluid. Using our definition of a (higher) Monge-Ampere structure, we study an associated metric on the cotangent bundle together with its pull-back to the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold. The signatures of these metrics are dictated by the relationship between vorticity and rate-of-strain, and their scalar curvatures can be interpreted in a physical context in terms of the accumulation of vorticity, strain, and their gradients. We show explicity, in the case of two-dimensional flows, how topological information can be derived from the Monge-Ampere geometry of the Lagrangian submanifold. We also demonstrate how certain solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, such as Hill's spherical vortex and an integrable case of Arnol'd-Beltrami-Childress flow, have symmetries that facilitate a formulation of these solutions from the perspective of (higher) symplectic reduction.</description>

Abstract: Cylindrically symmetric quantum mechanical systems with position dependent masses (PDM) admitting at least one second order integral of motion are classified. It is proved that there exist 68 such systems which are inequivalent. Among them there are twenty seven superintegrable and twelve maximally superintegrable. The arbitrary elements of the correspondinding Hamiltonians (i.e.,masses and potentials) are presented explicitly.</description>

      <title>Existence of de Almeida-Thouless-type instability in the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpolation method for mean field spin glass models developed by Guerra and Talagrand is extended to a quantum mean field spin glass model. This extension enables us to obtain both replica-symmetric (RS) and one step replica-symmetry breaking (1RSB) solutions of the free energy density in the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. It is shown that the RS solution is exact in the paramagnetic phase. We provide a sufficient condition on coupling constants where the 1RSB solution gives better bound than the RS one. This condition reduced to physical quantities in disordered single spin systems allows a simple computer-assisted proof for the existence of the de Almeida-Thouless-type instability.</description>

      <title>About the (in)equivalence between holonomic versus non-holonomic theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scenarios in which a holonomic versus a non-holonomic frame description of gravity theories are equivalent. It turns out that classically, the equivalence holds in a way that is independent of the particular dynamics and/or spacetime dimension. This includes general metric-affine dynamics. A global bundle-theoretical investigation is carried out, uncovering the equivalence principle as the culprit. The equivalence holds as long as the equivalence principle holds. This is not something to be expected when non-invertible configurations of the vielbein field are taken into account. In such case, the gauge-theoretical description of gravity unsolders from spacetime, and one has to decide if gravity is spacetime geometry or an internal gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the singular values of certain Young diagram shaped random matrices. For block-shaped random matrices, the empirical distribution of the squares of the singular eigenvalues converges almost surely to a distribution whose moments are a generalisation of the Catalan numbers. The limiting distribution is the density of a product of rescaled independent Beta random variables and its Stieltjes-Cauchy transform has a hypergeometric representation. In special cases we recover the Marchenko-Pastur and Dykema-Haagerup measures of square and triangular random matrices, respectively. We find a further factorisation of the moments in terms of two complex-valued random variables that generalises the factorisation of the Marcenko-Pastur law as product of independent uniform and arcsine random variables.</description>

      <title>From the XXZ chain to the integrable Rydberg-blockade ladder via non-invertible duality defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14081v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting models often possess "dualities" subtler than a one-to-one mapping of energy levels. The maps can be non-invertible, as apparent in the canonical example of Kramers and Wannier. We analyse an algebraic structure common to the XXZ spin chain and three other models: Rydberg-blockade bosons with one particle per square of a ladder, a three-state antiferromagnet, and two Ising chains coupled in a zigzag fashion. The structure yields non-invertible maps between the four models while also guaranteeing all are integrable. We construct these maps explicitly utilising topological defects coming from fusion categories and the lattice version of the orbifold construction, and use them to give explicit conformal-field-theory partition functions describing their critical regions. The Rydberg and Ising ladders also possess interesting non-invertible symmetries, with the spontaneous breaking of one in the former resulting in an unusual ground-state degeneracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A previous paper by the authors found explicit contour integral formulas for certain joint moments of the multi-species q-TAZRP (totally asymmetric zero range process), using algebraic methods. These contour integral formulas have a "pseudo-factorized" form which makes asymptotic analysis simpler. In this brief note, we use those contour integral formulas to find the asymptotics of the two-point correlations. As expected, the term arising from the "shift-invariance" makes a non-trivial asymptotic contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01934v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and review several models of fractional viscous stresses from the literature, which generalise classical viscosity theories to fractional orders by replacing total strain derivatives in time with fractional time derivatives. We also briefly introduce Prony-type approximations of these theories. Here we investigate the issues of material frame-indifference and thermodynamic consistency for these models and find that on these bases, some are physically unacceptable. Next we study elementary shearing and tensile motions, observing that some models are more convenient to use than others for the analysis of creep and relaxation. Finally, we compute the incremental stresses due to small-amplitude wave propagation in a deformed material, with a view to establish acousto-elastic formulas for prospective experimental calibrations.</description>

      <title>Global Finite-Energy Solutions of the Compressible Euler-Poisson Equations for General Pressure Laws with Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with global finite-energy solutions of the three-dimensional compressible Euler-Poisson equations with gravitational potential and general pressure law, especially including the constitutive equation of white dwarf stars. We construct global finite-energy solutions of the Cauchy problem for the Euler-Poisson equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry as the inviscid limit of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing viscosity solutions is achieved through entropy analysis, uniform estimates in $L^p$, and a more general compensated compactness framework via several new ingredients. A key estimate is first established for the integrability of the density over unbounded domains independent of the viscosity coefficient. Then a special entropy pair is carefully designed by solving a Goursat problem for the entropy equation such that a higher integrability of the velocity is established, which is a crucial step. Moreover, the weak entropy kernel for the general pressure law and its fractional derivatives of the required order near vacuum ($\rho=0$) and far-field ($\rho=\infty$) are carefully analyzed. Owing to the generality of the pressure law, only the $W^{-1,p}_{{\rm loc}}$-compactness of weak entropy dissipation measures with $p\in [1,2)$ can be obtained; this is rescued by the equi-integrability of weak entropy pairs which can be established by the estimates obtained above so that the div-curl lemma still applies. Finally, based on the above analysis of weak entropy pairs, the $L^p$ compensated compactness framework for the compressible Euler equations with general pressure law is established. This new compensated compactness framework and the techniques developed in this paper should be useful for solving further nonlinear problems with similar features.</description>

Abstract: We study the algebraic structures which govern the deformation of supersymmetric intersections of M2 and M5 branes. The universal algebras on M2 and M5 branes are deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra respectively. We give a new presentation of the deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$, and we give a rigorous mathematical construction of the $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra. A new presentation of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ is also obtained. We construct various coproducts of these algebras, which are expected to encode the fusions of defects in twisted M-theory. The matrix extended Miura operators are identified as intertwiners in certain bimodules of these algebras.</description>

      <title>Tightness of exponential metrics for log-correlated Gaussian fields in arbitrary dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the tightness of a natural approximation scheme for an analog of the Liouville quantum gravity metric on $\mathbb R^d$ for arbitrary $d\geq 2$. More precisely, let $\{h_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ be a suitable sequence of Gaussian random functions which approximates a log-correlated Gaussian field on $\mathbb R^d$. Consider the family of random metrics on $\mathbb R^d$ obtained by weighting the lengths of paths by $e^{\xi h_n}$, where $\xi &gt; 0$ is a parameter. We prove that if $\xi$ belongs to the subcritical phase (which is defined by the condition that the distance exponent $Q(\xi)$ is greater than $\sqrt{2d}$), then after appropriate re-scaling, these metrics are tight and that every subsequential limit is a metric on $\mathbb R^d$ which induces the Euclidean topology. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Two pseudo-Goldstone bosons in the Gildener-Weinberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a dimensionless multi-scalar extension of the Standard Model, Gildener and Weinberg assumed that along a flat direction, there is only one classically massless scalar, known as the "scalon", which acquires mass through radiative corrections \`a la Coleman-Weinberg, while all other scalars remain heavy. In this paper, by introducing a toy model with four scalar degrees of freedom we show that this assumption is not always correct. In fact, we demonstrate the existence of two scalons along a specific flat direction that we construct. We present the effective potential for the model and provide the masses of the heavy scalars and two radiatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <title>Ozawa's Intersubjectivity Theorem as justification of RQM's postulate on internally consistent descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ozawa's Intersubjectivity Theorem (OIT) proved within quantum measurement theory supports the new postulate of relational quantum mechanics (RQM), the postulate on internally consistent descriptions. But from OIT viewpoint postulate's formulation should be completed by the assumption of probability reproducibility</description>

      <title>Lanczos spectrum for random operator growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov methods have reappeared recently, connecting physically sensible notions of complexity with quantum chaos and quantum gravity. In these developments, the Hamiltonian and the Liouvillian are tridiagonalized so that Schrodinger/Heisenberg time evolution is expressed in the Krylov basis. In the context of Schrodinger evolution, this tridiagonalization has been carried out in Random Matrix Theory. We extend these developments to Heisenberg time evolution, describing how the Liouvillian can be tridiagonalized as well until the end of Krylov space. We numerically verify the analytical formulas both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian matrix models.</description>

      <title>Amplitude modulations and resonant decay of excited oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the decay of strongly excited oscillons in a single vacuum model reveals a chaotic, fractal-like pattern very much like one found in kink-antikink collision in the $\phi^4$ model. This structure can be attributed to the resonant energy transfer mechanism triggered by the modulations of amplitudes of constituent oscillons which form the excited oscillon. We also find evidence that such modulations arise as a motion of two quasi-breathers inside the constituent oscillon.</description>

      <title>Large deformations in terms of stretch and rotation and local solution to the non-stationary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider and generalize a model, recently proposed and analytically investigated in its quasi-stationary approximation by the authors, for visco-elasticity with large deformations and conditional compatibility, where the independent variables are the stretch and the rotation tensors. The model takes the form of a system of integro-differential coupled equations. Here, its derivation is generalized to consider mixed boundary conditions, which may represent a wider range of physical applications then the case with Dirichlet boundary conditions considered in our previous contribution. This also introduces nontrivial technical difficulties in the theoretical framework, related to the definition and the regularity of the solutions of elliptic operators with mixed boundary conditions. As a novel contribution, we develop the analysis of the fully non-stationary version of the system where we consider inertia. In this context, we prove the existence of a local in time weak solution in three space dimensions, employing techniques from PDEs and convex analysis.</description>
