      <title>The untapped power of a general theory of organismal metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What makes living things special is how they manage matter, energy, and entropy. A general theory of organismal metabolism should therefore be quantified in these three currencies while capturing the unique way they flow between individuals and their environments. We argue that such a theory has quietly arrived -- 'Dynamic Energy Budget' (DEB) theory -- which conceptualises organisms as a series of macrochemical reactions that use energy to transform food into structured biomass and bioproducts while producing entropy. We show that such conceptualisation is deeply rooted in thermodynamic principles and that, with the help of a small set of biological assumptions, it underpins the emergence of fundamental ecophysiological phenomena, most notably the three-quarter power scaling of metabolism. Building on the subcellular nature of the theory, we unveil the eco-evolutionary relevance of coarse-graining biomass into qualitatively distinct, stoichiometricially fixed pools with implicitly regulated dynamics based on surface area-volume relations. We also show how generalised enzymes called 'synthesising units' and an information-based state variable called 'maturity' capture transitions between ecological and physiological metabolic interactions, and thereby transitions between unicellular and multicellular metabolic organisation. Formal theoretical frameworks make the constraints imposed by the laws of nature explicit, which in turn leads to better research hypotheses and avoids errors in reasoning. DEB theory uniquely applies thermodynamic formalism to organismal metabolism, linking biological processes across different scales through the transformation of matter and energy, the production of entropy, and the exchange of information. We propose ways in which the theory can inform trans-disciplinary efforts at the frontiers of the life sciences.</description>

      <title>Bounding the number of reticulation events for displaying multiple trees in a phylogenetic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing a parsimonious phylogenetic network that displays multiple phylogenetic trees is an important problem in theory of phylogenetics, where the complexity of the inferred networks is measured by reticulation numbers. The reticulation number for a set of trees is defined as the minimum number of reticulations in a phylogenetic network that displays those trees. A mathematical problem is bounding the reticulation number for multiple trees over a fixed number of taxa. While this problem has been extensively studied for two trees, much less is known about the upper bounds on the reticulation numbers for three or more arbitrary trees. In this paper, we present a few non-trivial upper bounds on reticulation numbers for three or more trees.</description>

      <title>The complex world of honey bee vibrational signaling: A response to Ramsey et al. (2017)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramsey et al. report on the characteristics and temporal distribution of an interesting vibrational signal that they term the whooping signal, primarily based upon a long-term study of vibrations recorded by accelerometers placed inside two honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, one in France and one in the United Kingdom. The goal of the study, the long-term automated recording and analysis of honey bee vibrational signaling, is worthwhile. However, we believe that some of the conclusions drawn by the authors are not well supported, given the evidence.</description>

      <title>Interconnection between density-regulation and stability in competitive ecological network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In natural ecosystems, species can be characterized by the nonlinear density-dependent self-regulation of their growth profile. Species of many taxa show a substantial density-dependent reduction for low population size. Nevertheless, many show the opposite trend; density regulation is minimal for small populations and increases significantly when the population size is near the carrying capacity. The theta-logistic growth equation can portray the intraspecific density regulation in the growth profile, theta being the density regulation parameter. In this study, we examine the role of these different growth profiles on the stability of a competitive ecological community with the help of a mathematical model of competitive species interactions. This manuscript deals with the random matrix theory to understand the stability of the classical theta-logistic models of competitive interactions. Our results suggest that having more species with strong density dependence, which self-regulate at low densities, leads to more stable communities. With this, stability also depends on the complexity of the ecological network. Species network connectance (link density) shows a consistent trend of increasing stability, whereas community size (species richness) shows a context-dependent effect. We also interpret our results from the aspect of two different life history strategies: r and K-selection. Our results show that the stability of a competitive network increases with the fraction of r-selected species in the community. Our result is robust, irrespective of different network architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantifying age-specific household contacts in Aotearoa New Zealand for infectious disease modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accounting for population age structure and age-specific contact patterns is crucial for accurate modelling of human infectious disease dynamics and impact. A common approach is to use contact matrices, which estimate the number of contacts between individuals of different ages. These contact matrices are frequently based on data collected from populations with very different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics from the population of interest. Here we use a comprehensive household composition dataset based on Aotearoa New Zealand census and administrative data to construct a household contact matrix and a synthetic population that can be used for modelling. We investigate the behaviour of a compartment-based and an agent-based epidemic model parameterised using this data, compared to a commonly used contact matrix that was constructed by projecting international data onto New Zealand's population. We find that using the New Zealand household data, either in a compartment-based model or in an agent-based model, leads to lower attack rates in older age groups compared to using the projected contact matrix. This difference becomes larger when household transmission is more dominant relative to non-household transmission. We provide electronic versions of the synthetic population and household contact matrix for other researchers to use in infectious disease models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that connects thermodynamic dissipation to replicator per-capita decay and growth rates. We argue from basic thermodynamic principles against this interpretation. In fact, we suggest that such a relationship cannot exist in principle, because it is impossible for a thermodynamically-consistent replicator to undergo both per-capita growth and per-capita decay back into reactants. On the other hand, a replicator may undergo per-capita decay into separate waste products, but in that case replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship that connects their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>
