      <title>Improved Upper Bounds for Numerical Radius Inequalities of Operator Matrices and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents new upper bounds for the numerical radii of operator matrices, with a focus on $n \times n$ and $2 \times 2$ block matrices acting on Hilbert space direct sums. By employing techniques such as the H\"older-McCarthy inequality, Jensen's inequality, Bohr's inequality, and extensions of the Buzano inequality, we derive improved estimates that refine classical results by Kittaneh, El-Haddad, Dragomir, Buzano, and others. Our main contributions include bounds for general operator matrices, specific results for off-diagonal matrices, and inequalities for sums and products of operators. Through detailed comparisons and special cases, we demonstrate that our results enhance existing numerical radius inequalities. A key feature of our work is the use of parameter-dependent refinements with constants derived from extended Buzano-type inequalities. The applications of these results span quantum mechanics, integro-differential equations, and fractional calculus, providing sharper tools for stability analysis and numerical approximation in mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of the $G$-equivariant Spectral Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral flow is an integer-valued homotopy invariant for paths of selfadjoint Fredholm operators. Lesch as well as Pejsachowicz, Fitzpatrick and Ciriza independently showed that it is uniquely characterised by its elementary properties. The authors recently introduced a $G$-equivariant spectral flow for paths of selfadjoint Fredholm operators that are equivariant under the action of a compact Lie group $G$. The purpose of this paper is to show that the $G$-equivariant spectral flow is uniquely characterised by the same elementary properties when appropriately restated. As an application we introduce an alternative definition of the $G$-equivariant spectral flow via a $G$-equivariant Maslov index.</description>

      <title>Random Operator-Valued Frames in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for operator-valued random variables on separable Hilbert spaces. Random operators are defined as measurable maps into the space of bounded operators, with measurability understood in the strong operator sense. Under a coercivity condition on i.i.d. random positive contractions, an iterative scheme is introduced and shown to converge both in mean square and almost surely. The limit is identified, and the resulting family of iterated random operators forms a random operator-valued frame. In the special case of random projections, the construction yields a Parseval-type identity.</description>

      <title>Optimal K dual frames and pairs in the presence of erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the structure of optimal K-dual frames for a given K-frame and optimal K-dual pairs, within the context of erasures which occur during the transmission of frame coefficients. We address two distinct erasure scenarios and examine their impact on the reconstruction process. The optimality criteria are defined in terms of minimizing the spectral radius and the operator norm of the associated error operators. Through this approach, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating the effects of erasures in frame theory, contributing to enhanced robustness in data transmission and recovery.</description>

      <title>Operator Decomposition via Total Sequences in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of total sequences in complex Hilbert spaces and construct explicit representations of the identity operator as a series of rank-one operators. Given a total sequence ${v_n}_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \subseteq \mathcal{H}$, we establish the existence of sequences ${w_n}, {z_n} \subseteq \mathcal{H}$ and a monotonic function $\varphi: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $\varphi(n) \leq n$, such that $z_n$ lies in the span of ${v_k: k \geq \varphi(n)}$ and $\mathrm{id}{\mathcal{H}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty w_n z_n^*$ converges in the strong operator topology. Our proof combines orthogonal decomposition techniques, separability arguments, and Neumann series methods to construct a global operator identity from local approximations. This contributes to the understanding of total sequences and their role in operator-theoretic constructions.</description>

      <title>Jordan Left $\alpha$-centralizers on Algebras with Applications to Group Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every Jordan left $\alpha$-centralizer from an algebra $A$ with a right identity into an arbitrary algebra $B$ is a left $\alpha$-centralizer. This implies all Jordan homomorphisms between such algebras are homomorphisms. We extend this result to continuous Jordan left $\alpha$-centralizers when $A$ has a bounded left approximate identity. For the group algebra $L^1(G)$, we characterize weakly compact Jordan left $\alpha$-centralizers when $\alpha$ is continuous and surjective, showing $L^1(G)$ admits a weakly compact epimorphism if and only if $G$ is finite. Consequently, the existence of a non-zero $\alpha$-derivation on $L^1(G)$ is equivalent to $G$ being compact and non-abelian.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the Capacity in Operator Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Completely positive operators are fundamental objects in quantum information theory and the capacity of such operators plays a pivotal role in the operator scaling algorithm. Using this algorithm, Garg--Gurvits--Oliveira--Wigderson recently established a certain quantitative continuity result for the capacity map at rational points. We show by different means that operator capacity possesses significantly greater regularity. Our argument gives local H\"{o}lder continuity at all points and rests on a result of Bennett--Bez--Buschenhenke--Cowling--Flock on weighted sums of exponential functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate threshold phenomena in weighted $\ell^2$-spaces and characterize the critical regimes where elements with either maximally bad range or with small support can be constructed. Our results are shown to be optimal in several respects, with proofs relying on techniques involving sparse Fourier support. We further show that these seemingly pathological constructions are actually generic from certain categorical perspectives.</description>

      <title>The essential spectrum of periodically stationary pulses in lumped models of short-pulse fiber lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern short pulse fiber lasers there is significant pulse breathing over each round trip of the laser loop. Consequently, averaged models cannot be used for quantitative modeling and design. Instead, lumped models, which are obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser, are required. Since the pulses in lumped models are periodic rather than stationary, their linear stability is evaluated with the aid of the monodromy operator obtained by linearizing the round trip operator about the periodic pulse. Conditions are given on the smoothness and decay of the periodic pulse which ensure that the monodromy operator exists on an appropriate Lebesgue function space. A formula for the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator is given which can be used to quantify the growth rate of continuous wave perturbations. This formula is established by showing that the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator equals that of an associated asymptotic operator. Since the asymptotic monodromy operator acts as a multiplication operator in the Fourier domain, it is possible to derive a formula for its spectrum. Although the main results are stated for a particular experimental stretched pulse laser, the analysis shows that they can be readily adapted to a wide range of lumped laser models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kulikov (\cite{Ku}) has shown that certain convex functionals on weighted Bergman spaces are maximized by reproducing kernels. We prove that the same functionals hves near-maximal values for functions that are close to reproducing kernels. This is proved in a quantitative sense where both the norm and the exponent are optimal and the constant is explicit. We give several applications and some relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Sparse Gabor representations of metaplectic operators: controlled exponential decay and Schr\"odinger confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the phase space analysis of Schr\"odinger evolution operators, in this paper we investigate how metaplectic operators are approximately diagonalized along the corresponding symplectic flows by exponentially localized Gabor wave packets. Quantitative bounds for the matrix coefficients arising in the Gabor wave packet decomposition of such operators are established, revealing precise exponential decay rates together with subtler dispersive and spreading phenomena. To this aim, we present several novel results concerning the time-frequency analysis of functions with controlled Gelfand-Shilov regularity, which are of independent interest. As a byproduct, we generalize Vemuri's Gaussian confinement results for the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator in two respects, namely by encompassing general exponential decay rates as well as arbitrary quadratic Schr\"odinger propagators. In particular, we extensively discuss some prominent models such as the harmonic oscillator, the free particle in a constant magnetic field and fractional Fourier transforms.</description>

      <title>Vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces with Group Lasso Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.00819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on establishing a mathematical basis for kernel methods in sparse multi-task learning, we explore the theory of vector-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBSs) endowed with $\ell_{p,1}$-norms ($1\le p\le +\infty$), encompassing both the sparse learning case when $p=1$ and the group lasso when $p=2$. We develop RKBSs equipped with these group lasso norms that support the linear representer theorem for regularized learning frameworks. Additionally, we introduce reproducing kernels admissible for this construction. Such reproducing kernels are applicable to sparse multi-task learning with group lasso norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study maps of bounded variation defined on a metric measure space and valued into a metric space. Assuming the source space to satisfy a doubling and Poincar\'e property, we produce a well-behaved relaxation theory via approximation by simple maps. Moreover, several equivalent characterizations are given, including a notion in weak duality with test plans.</description>

      <title>A representation for the Fremlin projective tensor product between Banach lattices: a topological point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arbitrary topological space $X$, assume that $S(X)$ is the vector lattice of all equivalence classes of real-valued continuous functions on open dense subsets of $X$; it is a laterally complete vector lattice but not a normed lattice, certainly. Nevertheless, we can have the extended unbounded norm topology ($un$-topology) on it. On the other hand, by a remarkable result of Wickstead, there exists a representation approach for every Archimedean vector lattice $E$ in terms of $S(X)$-spaces. In this paper, we show that this representation is order continuous and when $E$ is order complete, it coincides with the known Maeda-Ogasawara representation. Moreover, when $E$ is a Banach lattice, by consideration of the $un$-topology on $E$ and the extended $un$-topology on $S(X)$, we show that this representation is, in fact, a homeomorphism. With the aid of this topological attitude, we establish a representation theorem (in fact a homeomorphism) for the Fremlin projective tensor product between Banach lattices, in terms of $S(X)$-spaces, as well.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Trace Formulas for Contractive and Dissipative Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish higher order trace formulas for pairs of contractions along a multiplicative path generated by a self-adjoint operator in a Schatten-von Neumann ideal, removing earlier stringent restrictions on the kernel and defect operator of the contractions and enlarging the set of admissible functions. We also derive higher order trace formulas for maximal dissipative operators under relaxed assumptions and new simplified trace formulas for unitary and resolvent comparable self-adjoint operators. The respective spectral shift measures are absolutely continuous and, in the case of contractions, the set of admissible functions for the $n$th order trace formula on the unit circle includes the Besov class $B^n_{\infty, 1}(\T)$. Both aforementioned properties are new in the mentioned generality.</description>

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups and applications to evolution families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp. simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [33, 11, 13]). In the \emph{non-commutative} setting, Sz.-Nagy [45] and Bo\.{z}ejko [4] provided means to dilate arbitrary families of contractions. The present work extends this discrete-time result to families $\{T_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) An explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) A full proof with an explicit construction, via the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S\l{}oci\'{n}ski [40, 41] as well as a version for topologised index sets via a reformulation of the Trotter--Kato theorem for co-generators, leading to applications to evolution families; and 3) A second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups, which admits a natural reformulation to semigroup defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ and leads to various residuality results.</description>

Abstract: Given a conjugation (involution) $C$ on a Hilbert space, $C$-self-adjoint contractive extensions of a non-densely defined $C$-symmetric contraction are studied and
  parameterizations of all such extensions are obtained. As an application, a proof of an announced result of Glazman \cite{Glazman1} on the existence of maximal dissipative $C$-self-adjoint extensions of a densely defined $C$-symmetric dissipative operator is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polarity notion for sets in a Banach space is introduced in such a way that the second polar of a set coincides with the smallest strongly convex set with respect to R that contains it. Strongly convex sets are characterized in terms of their associated farthest distance functions, and farthest distance functions associated with strongly convex sets are characterized, too.</description>

      <title>Functional limit theorems and parameter inference for multiscale stochastic models of enzyme kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with jumps modeling multistage Michaelis--Menten enzyme kinetics, in which a substrate is sequentially transformed into a product via a cascade of intermediate complexes. These networks are typically high dimensional and exhibit multiscale behavior with strong coupling between different components, posing substantial analytical and computational challenges. In particular, the problem of statistical inference of reaction rates is significantly difficult, and becomes even more intricate when direct observations of system states are unavailable and only a random sample of product formation times is observed. We address this in two stages. First, in a suitable scaling regime consistent with the Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA), we rigorously establish two asymptotic results: (i) a stochastic averaging principle yielding a reduced model for the product--substrate dynamics; and (ii) a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT) characterizing the associated fluctuations. Guided by the reduced-order dynamics, we next construct a novel Interacting Particle System (IPS) that approximates the product-substrate process at the particle level. This IPS plays a pivotal role in the inference methodology; in particular, we establish a propagation of chaos result that mathematically justifies an approximate product-form likelihood based solely on a random sample of product formation times, without requiring access to the system states. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>John Ellipsoids of Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding a largest Euclidean ball in a given convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and finding a largest volume ellipsoid in $K$ are two problems of fundamentally different nature. The first is a purely Euclidean problem, where we consider scaled copies of the origin-centered closed unit ball, whereas in the second problem, we search among all affine copies of the unit ball.
  In this paper, we interpolate between these two classical problems by considering ellipsoids of revolution. More generally, we study pairs of convex bodies $K$ and $L$, and seek a largest-volume affine image of $K$ contained within $L$, subject to certain restrictions on the allowed affine transformations. We derive first-order necessary conditions for optimality, generalizing known conditions from the unrestricted affine setting.
  Using these conditions, we show that an extremal ellipsoid of revolution exhibits properties analogous to those of either the largest-volume ellipsoid or the largest Euclidean ball, depending on whether the ellipsoid is considered along its axis of revolution or along the orthogonal complement of that axis.</description>
