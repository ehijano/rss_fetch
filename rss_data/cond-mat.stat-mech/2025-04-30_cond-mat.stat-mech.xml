      <title>Thermodynamics for an electron gas in a uniform magnetic field in nonextensive statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with the physical system governed by a Hamiltonian operator, in two-dimensional space, of spinless charged particles subject to a perpendicular magnetic field B, coupled with a harmonic potential in the context of nonextensive statistical thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of such a quantum gas system is elaborated in the framework of Tsallis statistics by obtaining the q versions of the partition function, magnetization, and susceptibility after performing the Hilhorst integral transformation. The results are discussed in the q $\mapsto$ 1 limit.</description>

      <title>Phase-locking in dynamical systems and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the Prufer transform that connects the dynamical system on the torus and the Hill equation, which is interpreted as either the equation of motion for the parametric oscillator or the Schrodinger equation with periodic potential. The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits. Our picture is supported by numerical simulations for the model of the Josephson junction and Mathieu equation.</description>

      <title>2D Active Brownian run-and-tumble particles moment analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an active Brownian run-and-tumble particle (ABRTP) model, that consists of an active Brownian run state during which the active velocity of the particle diffuses on the unit circle, and a tumble state during which the active velocity is zero, both with exponentially distributed time. Additionally we add a harmonic trap as an external potential. In the appropriate limits the ABRTP model reduces either to the active Brownian particle model, or the run-and-tumble particle model. Using the method of direct integration the equation of motion, pioneered by Kac, we obtain exact moments for the Laplace transform of the time dependent ABRTP, in the presence or absence of a harmonic trap. In addition we estimate the distribution moments with the help of the Chebyshev polynomials. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical ensemble out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced by Boltzmann under the name "monode," the microcanonical ensemble serves as the fundamental representation of equilibrium thermodynamics in statistical mechanics by counting all realizations of a system's states. Ensemble theory connects this idea with probability and information theory, leading to the notion of Shannon-Gibbs entropy and, ultimately, to the principle of maximum caliber describing trajectories of systems in and out of equilibrium. While the latter generalization reproduces many results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, given a proper choice of observables, its physical justification remains an open area of research. What is the microscopic origin and physical interpretation of this variational approach? What guides the choice of relevant observables? We address these questions by extending Boltzmann's method to a microcanonical caliber principle and counting realizations of a system's trajectories -- all assumed equally probable. Maximizing the microcanonical caliber under the imposed macro- and micro-scopic constraints, we systematically develop generalized detailed-balance relations, clarify the statistical origins of inhomogeneous transport, and provide an independent derivation of key equations underlying the theories of random walks and stochastic thermodynamics. This approach introduces a dynamical ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady states in spatially extended and active systems. While verifying the equivalence of ensembles, e.g. those of Norton and Thevenin, our theory highlights differences between nonequilibrium regimes not evident in the traditional formulation of the maximum-caliber principle. We validate our results by stochastic simulations. Our theory suggests further connections to the first principles of microscopic dynamics, which are critical for investigating systems where the conditions for thermodynamic behavior are not satisfied.</description>

      <title>The specific heat anomaly stems from a third-order phase transition in the 2D lattice sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific heat anomaly (SHA) is broadly observed in statistical mechanics, appearing as a smooth, system-size-independent peak in the specific heat, in contrast to the singular behavior typical of second-order phase transitions (PTs). Its origin remains heavily debated: some attribute it to finite-size effects, others to unidentified phase transitions. Here we investigate SHA using the two-dimensional sine-Gordon (2D-sG) model and microcanonical inflection point analysis (MIPA), uncovering two key results. First, we show that the roughening transition in the 2D-sG model is a genuine third-order PT under MIPA, where the standard thermodynamic quantities remain continuous. This clarifies the ambiguity in the literature, where this transition was often, though inconclusively, attributed to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. Through the use of MIPA and a comprehensive analysis of standard thermodynamic observables, we provide a coherent thermodynamic characterization that redefines the nature of this transition. Second, we find that the SHA is not itself a PT but rather the thermodynamic fingerprint of this third-order transition. These findings clarify the nature of SHA within the 2D-sG model and suggest that similar anomalies in other systems, such as the XY model, may likewise originate from third-order PTs, rather than mere crossovers. Our results provide a consistent thermodynamic interpretation of the SHA and highlight the broader relevance of third-order transitions in systems previously thought to exhibit only low-order or crossover transition.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic interpretation to Stochastic Fisher Information and Single-Trajectory Speed Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher information (FI) metric is a Riemannian metric that allows a geometric treatment of stochastic thermodynamics, introducing the possibility of computing thermodynamic lengths and deviations from equilibrium. At the trajectory level, a related quantity can be introduced, the stochastic Fisher information (SFI), which on average, is equivalent to the FI. In this work, we discuss two fundamental questions regarding the SFI; namely, (i) what is the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI is and (ii) whether there are any trajectory-level thermodynamic bounds due to the SFI. We find that, contrary to previous results in the literature for the FI, the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI depends only on the entropy produced by the system and on the thermodynamic force. Moreover, we find that the SFI allows one to derive single-trajectory speed limits, which we demonstrate to hold for a Brownian particle under a saturating drive force and a Brownian particle under a decreasing drive force. From the ensemble of single-trajectory bounds one can derive a hierarchy of average speed limits that are always less tight than the one derived from the FI. We test our results for speed limits on the adopted models and find that the hierarchy of average speed limits is respected and that the single-trajectory speed limits behave qualitatively similarly to the average and stochastic speed limits, with some trajectories achieving velocities higher than the tightest average bound whenever it does not saturate. Our results open avenues for the exploration of uncertainty relations at the trajectory level.</description>

      <title>Surmise for random matrices' level spacing distributions beyond nearest-neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distribution. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature does not accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically better at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>The Anyonic Quantum Carnot Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining two disparate lines of thought like thermodynamics and quantum mechanics yields surprising results. The resulting idea of quantum thermodynamic engines holds promise for harvesting novel sources of energy of purely quantum origin, like quantum statistics, to extract mechanical work from macroscopic quantum systems like Bose-Einstein condensates. It also allows one to explore thermodynamic thinking to `small' systems consisting only a few particles in quantum theory. In an earlier paper we had studied the quantum Otto engine using a small number of one-dimensional anyons as the medium to drive the thermodynamic engine. In this sequel, we study the gold-standard of thermodynamic engines, namely the Carnot engine, using two-dimensional anyons as the medium. An explicit expression is derived for the efficiency of the anyonic quantum Carnot engine.</description>

      <title>AIM: A User-friendly GUI Workflow program for Isotherm Fitting, Mixture Prediction, Isosteric Heat of Adsorption Estimation, and Breakthrough Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments and scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines fixed-bed adsorption analysis through an integrated workflow for isotherm fitting, heat of adsorption estimation, mixture prediction, and multicomponent breakthrough simulations. AIM's intuitive GUI requires no coding and supports a broad isotherm library (e.g., Langmuir, Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov, Structural-Transition-Adsorption). It also enables non-isothermal breakthrough simulations with axial dispersion. Case studies, such as Xe/Kr breakthrough curves in SBMOF-1, closely match the results from other software applications, such as RUPTURA. Mixture predictions can be done using the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) and Extended Langmuir models, while isosteric heats are derived from Clausius-Clapeyron or Virial equations. Users can export detailed column and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple formats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</description>

      <title>Critical clusters in liquid crystals: Fractal geometry and conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional domain morphology of twisted nematic liquid crystals during their phase-ordering kinetics [R. A. L. Almeida, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131 (2023) 268101], which is a physical candidate to self-generate critical clusters in the percolation universality class. Here we present experimental evidence that large clusters and their hulls are indeed both fractals with dimensions of the corresponding figures in critical percolation models. The asymptotic decay of a crossing probability, from a region in the vicinity of the origin to the boundary of disks, is described by the Lawler-Schramm-Werner theorem provided that a microscopic length in the original formulation is replaced by the coarsening length of the liquid crystal. Furthermore, the behavior for the winding angle of large loops is, at certain scales, compatible with that of Schramm-Loewner evolution curves with diffusivity $\kappa = 6$. These results show an experimental realization of critical clusters in phase ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha&gt;D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Koteck\'y and Preiss.</description>

      <title>Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of critical exponents in continuous dynamical phase transitions of weak noise theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions are nonequilibrium counterparts of thermodynamic phase transitions and share many similarities with their equilibrium analogs. In continuous phase transitions, critical exponents play a key role in characterizing the physics near criticality. This study aims to systematically analyze the set of possible critical exponents in weak noise statistical field theories in 1+1 dimensions, focusing on cases with a single fluctuating field. To achieve this, we develop and apply the Gaussian fluctuation method, avoiding reliance on constructing a Landau theory based on system symmetries. Our analysis reveals that the critical exponents can be categorized into a limited set of distinct cases, suggesting a constrained universality in weak noise-induced dynamical phase transitions. We illustrate our findings in two examples: short-time large deviations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process on a ring within the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

      <title>Jena lectures on generalized global symmetries: principles and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an elementary set of lectures on generalized global symmetries originally given at the Jena TPI School on QFT and Holography, designed to be accessible to the reader with a basic knowledge of quantum field theory. Topics covered include an introduction to higher-form symmetries with selected applications: Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories in the continuum and on the lattice, statistical mechanical systems, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly from the point of view of non-invertible symmetry, and magnetohydrodynamics. Mathematical formalism is kept to a minimum and an emphasis is placed on understanding the global symmetry structure present in well-known models.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomaly triggers the violation of scaling laws in gravitational system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws for critical phenomena take pivotal status in almost all branches of physics. However, as scaling laws are commonly guaranteed by the renormalization group theory, systems that violate them have rarely been found. In this letter, we demonstrate that gravitational system can break scaling laws. We derive this result through investigating phase transition and critical phenomenon in a gravitational system with quantum anomaly. For the first time, we outline the key conditions to violate the scaling laws in generic gravitational system viewed from the equation of state $P=P(T,V)$. Our results indicate that quantum effects can magnify the distinctiveness of gravity, which may be significant to understand the microscopic structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>The complete trans-series for conserved charges in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. The trans-series is written explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from the already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several ordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.</description>
