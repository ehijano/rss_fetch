      <title>Estimation and Inference for Causal Functions with Multiway Clustered Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes methods of estimation and uniform inference for a general class of causal functions, such as the conditional average treatment effects and the continuous treatment effects, under multiway clustering. The causal function is identified as a conditional expectation of an adjusted (Neyman-orthogonal) signal that depends on high-dimensional nuisance parameters. We propose a two-step procedure where the first step uses machine learning to estimate the high-dimensional nuisance parameters. The second step projects the estimated Neyman-orthogonal signal onto a dictionary of basis functions whose dimension grows with the sample size. For this two-step procedure, we propose both the full-sample and the multiway cross-fitting estimation approaches. A functional limit theory is derived for these estimators. To construct the uniform confidence bands, we develop a novel resampling procedure, called the multiway cluster-robust sieve score bootstrap, that extends the sieve score bootstrap (Chen and Christensen, 2018) to the novel setting with multiway clustering. Extensive numerical simulations showcase that our methods achieve desirable finite-sample behaviors. We apply the proposed methods to analyze the causal relationship between mistrust levels in Africa and the historical slave trade. Our analysis rejects the null hypothesis of uniformly zero effects and reveals heterogeneous treatment effects, with significant impacts at higher levels of trade volumes.</description>

      <title>Nowcasting with Mixed Frequency Data Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop Bayesian machine learning methods for mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regressions. This involves handling frequency mismatches and specifying functional relationships between many predictors and the dependent variable. We use Gaussian processes (GPs) and compress the input space with structured and unstructured MIDAS variants. This yields several versions of GP-MIDAS with distinct properties and implications, which we evaluate in short-horizon now- and forecasting exercises with both simulated data and data on quarterly US output growth and inflation in the GDP deflator. It turns out that our proposed framework leverages macroeconomic Big Data in a computationally efficient way and offers gains in predictive accuracy compared to other machine learning approaches along several dimensions.</description>

      <title>Common Trends and Long-Run Identification in Nonlinear Structural VARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is widely recognised that linear (structural) VARs may fail to capture important aspects of economic time series, the use of nonlinear SVARs has to date been almost entirely confined to the modelling of stationary time series, because of a lack of understanding as to how common stochastic trends may be accommodated within nonlinear models. This has unfortunately circumscribed the range of series to which such models can be applied -- and/or required that these series be first transformed to stationarity, a potential source of misspecification -- and prevented the use of long-run identifying restrictions in these models. To address these problems, we develop a flexible class of additively time-separable nonlinear SVARs, which subsume models with threshold-type endogenous regime switching, both of the piecewise linear and smooth transition varieties. We extend the Granger--Johansen representation theorem to this class of models, obtaining conditions that specialise exactly to the usual ones when the model is linear. We further show that, as a corollary, these models are capable of supporting the same kinds of long-run identifying restrictions as are available in linearly cointegrated SVARs.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Inference for Local Structural Parameters with Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct simultaneous confidence intervals for solutions to conditional moment equations. The intervals are built around a class of nonparametric regression algorithms based on subsampled kernels. This class encompasses various forms of subsampled random forest regression, including Generalized Random Forests (Athey et al., 2019). Although simultaneous validity is often desirable in practice -- for example, for fine-grained characterization of treatment effect heterogeneity -- only confidence intervals that confer pointwise guarantees were previously available. Our work closes this gap. As a by-product, we obtain several new order-explicit results on the concentration and normal approximation of high-dimensional U-statistics.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences when Parallel Trends Holds Conditional on Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study difference-in-differences identification and estimation strategies when the parallel trends assumption holds after conditioning on covariates. We consider empirically relevant settings where the covariates can be time-varying, time-invariant, or both. We uncover a number of weaknesses of commonly used two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regressions in this context, even in applications with only two time periods. In addition to some weaknesses due to estimating linear regression models that are similar to cases with cross-sectional data, we also point out a collection of additional issues that we refer to as \textit{hidden linearity bias} that arise because the transformations used to eliminate the unit fixed effect also transform the covariates (e.g., taking first differences can result in the estimating equation only including the change in covariates over time, not their level, and also drop time-invariant covariates altogether). We provide simple diagnostics for assessing how susceptible a TWFE regression is to hidden linearity bias based on reformulating the TWFE regression as a weighting estimator. Finally, we propose simple alternative estimation strategies that can circumvent these issues.</description>
