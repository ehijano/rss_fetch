      <title>Stabilizing by steering: Enhancing bacterial motility by non-uniform diffusiophoresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria are often required to navigate across confined spaces to reach desired destinations in biological and environmental systems, allowing critical functions in host-microbe symbiosis, infection, drug delivery, soil ecology, and soil bioremediation. While the canonical run-and-tumble motility is effective in finding targets under confinement, it may not represent the most ideal strategy due to the continuous monitoring of environmental cues and stochastic recorrection of their paths. Here, we show that salt gradients can be exploited to improve the run-and-tumble motility of flagellated soil bacteria, Pseudomonas putida, by biasing the cells' motion toward salt. Salt gradients impact bacterial swimming by straightening their runs toward salt, which we attribute to diffusiophoresis acting asymmetrically around the cell. This action imposes an effective torque on the cell body that is strong enough to overcome Brownian rotation, thereby stabilizing the motion and guiding the cells toward salt with straighter runs. We further demonstrate that imposing salt gradients in the presence of toxic organic contaminants enhances their chemotactic dispersion toward the contaminants via diffusiophoresis, suggesting its potential utility in bioremediation. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which salt gradients can bias bacterial motility, offering new opportunities to control microbial transport in complex environments.</description>

      <title>What does the tree of life look like as it grows? Evolution and the multifractality of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By unifying three foundational principles of modern biology, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the growing tree of life. Contrary to the static case, where the analogy between phylogenetic trees and the tree that grows in soil is drawn, our framework shows that the living tree of life is analogous to a Cantor dust where each branch is a distinct fractal curve. The system as a whole is therefore multifractal in the sense that it consists of many unique fractals. The three foundational principles for the mathematical framework are that phylogeny is nested, phylogeny is dualistic (i.e., transitive between singularities and populations), and phylogeny is stochastic. Integrating these three principles, we model the dynamic (i.e., living) tree of life as a random iterated function system that generates unique convexly related sequences of branching random variables (visualized in Animation 1). The multifractal nature of this dynamic tree of life implies that, for any two living entities, the time interval from their last common ancestor to the present moment is a distinct fractal curve for each. Thus, the length of a time interval along each distinct branch is unique, so that time is also multifractal and not an ultrametric on the tree of life.</description>

      <title>Rotational migration in human pancreatic ductal organoids depends on actin and myosin activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotational migration is one specific form of collective cell migration when epithelial cells are confined in a spherical geometry, such as in the epithelial acini. This tissue-level rotation motion is crucial for the morphogenesis of multiple epithelial systems. Here, we introduce a new primary human model for the study of rotational migration, pancreatic ductal organoids. Live imaging revealed the persistent rotation of the organoids over time. By tracking the nuclei, the three-dimensional trajectory of the cellular movement was reconstructed and the velocity of the rotation was quantified. The presence of focal adhesion clusters and prominent actin stress fibers were observed at the basal side of the organoids, suggesting the interactions between the cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Finally, our inhibition study showed the dependence of pancreatic ductal organoid rotational migration on myosin activity, actin polymerization, and actin branching. We hope that this model will enable future studies with human primary cells, which are more faithful to normal epithelial cells.</description>

      <title>Investigating time- and orientation-dependent transverse relaxation from magnetic susceptibility of white matter microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transverse relaxation in MRI is modulated by magnetic field variations arising from tissue microstructure, offering a potential window into the underlying chemical composition and structural organization at the cellular scale. However, the transverse relaxation rate in white matter depends on both echo time and the orientation of axons relative to the external field. Such anisotropy complicates the interpretation of transverse relaxation in general and as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease. Understanding this anisotropy is therefore crucial for accurately analyzing MRI signals. While previous modeling studies have investigated these effects, they often relied on simplified or idealized tissue geometries. In this study, we investigate magnetic field variance and intra-axonal transverse relaxation using realistic axonal microstructure extracted from 3D electron microscopy, incorporating myelinated axons with embedded spherical susceptibility sources. We derive the dependence of the transverse relaxation rate on the angle between axons and the external field and show through simulations that the time-dependence signature arising from white matter structural disorder is weak and may be undetectable at currently achievable noise levels, echo times, and field strengths. Our findings highlight the influence of axonal geometry on intra-axonal transverse relaxation and suggest that accounting for both time and orientation dependence may facilitate the development of more precise neuroimaging biomarkers for diseased tissue.</description>

      <title>A solution to the mystery of the sub-harmonic series and to the combination tone via a linear mathematical model of the cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple linear model of the cochlea as a set of vibrating strings. We make hypothesis that the information sent to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in the strings and consider all oscillation modes of the strings. We show the emergence of the sub-harmonic series whose existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound) shedding new light on this long debated subject.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Driven Spike Encoding for Fully Implantable Cochlear Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodynamic behavior of artificial neuron circuits made of Mott memristors provides versatile opportunities to utilize them for artificial sensing. Their small size and energy efficiency of generating spiking electrical signals enable usage in fully implantable cochlear implants. Here, we propose an auditory sensing unit realized by a piezo-MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) cantilever connected to a VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator circuit. This auditory sensing unit is capable of frequency-selective detection of vibrations and subsequent emission of a neural spiking waveform. The auditory sensing unit is tested under biologically realistic vibration amplitudes, and spike rate-encoding of the incoming stimulus is demonstrated, similarly to natural hearing processes. The tunability of the output spiking frequency and the shape of the spiking waveform are also demonstrated to provide suitable voltage spikes for the nervous system.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Kinetics of mRNA Molecules in a General Transcription Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic modeling of transcription is a classic yet long-standing problem in theoretical biophysics. The lack of unified results and a computationally efficient approach for a general, fine-grained transcription model has confined relevant research to some over-simplified special cases like the Telegraph model. This article establishes a general, unified and computationally efficient framework for studying stochastic transcription kinetics. We consider a chemical reaction model of transcription and construct the time-dependent solution to the corresponding chemical master equation. A well-known matrix-form expression for steady-state binomial moments is recovered by calculating the temporal limit of the time-dependent dynamics. Two novel inequalities for binomial moments and the probability mass function are derived using techniques from functional analysis. It follows that the distribution of mRNA counts is upper-bounded by a constant multiple of Poisson distribution, thus mathematically proving the main statement of the Heavy-Tailed Law. Additionally, the standard binomial moment method is analyzed from a numerical perspective, where truncation error is estimated using our inequalities. Compared with some widely-used numerical methods, a key advantage of this result is the significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Active-Passive Brownian Particle in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a two-dimensional model for active particles whose self-propulsion speed is not fixed, but varies in time, and whose motion is subject to both translational and rotational diffusion. In the conventional treatment of active Brownian motion, the self-propulsion speed is taken to be constant - an assumption convenient for analysis but poorly matched to many real systems. Here we relax that assumption, allowing the speed $v(t)$ to fluctuate stochastically between two values: $v=0$ (a passive state) and $v=s$ (an active state). Transitions between these states are taken to follow a random telegraph process. This ``active-passive Brownian particle'' inherits limiting behaviors from both the purely active and purely passive Brownian cases. Analytical expressions for the first two displacement moments, and for the resulting effective diffusion coefficient, make this dual character explicit. Moreover, by an appropriate identification of parameters, a run-and-tumble particle - such as a motile bacterium - can be mapped onto this model in such a way that their large-scale diffusivities coincide.</description>
