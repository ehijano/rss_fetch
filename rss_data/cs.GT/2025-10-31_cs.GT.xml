      <title>Engineering Social Optimality via Utility Shaping in Non-Cooperative Games under Incomplete Information and Imperfect Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study decentralized decision-making where agents optimize private objectives under incomplete information and imperfect public monitoring, in a non-cooperative setting. By shaping utilities-embedding shadow prices or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT)-aligned penalties-we make the stage game an exact-potential game whose unique equilibrium equals the (possibly constrained) social optimum. We characterize the Bayesian equilibrium as a stochastic variational inequality; strong monotonicity follows from a single-inflection compressed/stretched-exponential response combined with convex pricing. We give tracking bounds for damped-gradient and best-response-with-hysteresis updates under a noisy public index, and corresponding steady-state error. The framework accommodates discrete and continuous action sets and composes with slower discrete assignment. Deployable rules include: embed prices/penalties; publish a single public index; tune steps, damping, and dual rates for contraction. Computational experiments cover (i) a multi-tier supply chain and (ii) a non-cooperative agentic-AI compute market of bidding bots. Relative to price-only baselines, utility shaping attains near-centralized welfare, eliminates steady-state constraint/capacity violations when feasible, and accelerates convergence; with quantization, discrete equilibria track continuous ones within the mesh. The blueprint is portable to demand response, cloud/edge scheduling, and transportation pricing and biosecurity/agriculture. Overall, utility shaping plus a public index implements the constrained social optimum with stable equilibria under noise and drift-an operations-research-friendly alternative to heavy messaging or full mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Fiat-Denominated Loans Collateralized by Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rising importance of cryptocurrencies as financial assets pushed their applicability from an object of speculation closer to standard financial instruments such as loans. In this work, we initiate the study of secure protocols that enable fiat-denominated loans collateralized by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. We provide limited-custodial protocols for such loans relying only on trusted arbitration and provide their game-theoretical analysis. We also highlight various interesting directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Proxemics and Permeability of the Pedestrian Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People tend to walk in groups, and interactions with those groups have a significant impact on crowd behavior and pedestrian traffic dynamics. Social norms can be seen as unwritten rules regulating people interactions in social settings. This article studies people interactions with groups and the emergence of group proxemics. Group zones, zone occupancy counts and people clearance from the group are studied using naturalistic data. Analysis indicate potential presence of three different zones in addition to the public zone. People tend to remain in the public zone and only progressively get closer to groups, and those closer approaches happen in a low frequency and for brief periods of time.</description>

      <title>Doubly Fair Parity Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-player games over finite graphs in which both players are restricted by fairness constraints on their moves. Given a two player game graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set of fair moves $E_f\subseteq E$ a player is said to play "fair" in $G$ if they choose an edge $e \in E_f$ infinitely often whenever the source vertex of $e$ is visited infinitely often. Otherwise, they play "unfair". We equip such games with two $\omega$-regular winning conditions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ deciding the winner of mutually fair and mutually unfair plays, respectively. Whenever one player plays fair and the other plays unfair, the fairly playing player wins the game. The resulting games are called "fair $\alpha/\beta$ games".
  We formalize fair $\alpha/\beta$ games and show that they are determined. For fair parity/parity games, i.e., fair $\alpha/\beta$ games where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are given each by a parity condition over $G$, we provide a polynomial reduction to (normal) parity games via a gadget construction inspired by the reduction of stochastic parity games to parity games. We further give a direct symbolic fixpoint algorithm to solve fair parity/parity games. On a conceptual level, we illustrate the translation between the gadget-based reduction and the direct symbolic algorithm which uncovers the underlying similarities of solution algorithms for fair and stochastic parity games, as well as for the recently considered class of fair games where only one player is restricted by fair moves.</description>

      <title>The Learning Approach to Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified framework for analyzing games in greater depth. In the existing literature, players' strategies are typically assigned scalar values, and equilibrium concepts are used to identify compatible choices. However, this approach neglects the internal structure of players, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors.
  To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player, consistent with constructions in reinforcement learning. Instead of defining games as external settings, our framework defines them in terms of the players themselves. This offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for this generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler models or compatibility analysis.
  For a general definition of a player, we discuss natural conditions on its components and define competition through their behavior. In the discrete setting, we consider players whose estimates largely follow the standard framework from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we conclude by examining relations to reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Multiple Proposer Transaction Fee Mechanism Design: Robust Incentives Against Censorship and Bribery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Censorship resistance is one of the core value proposition of blockchains. A recurring design pattern aimed at providing censorship resistance is enabling multiple proposers to contribute inputs into block construction. Notably, Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL) is proposed to be included in Ethereum. However, the current proposal relies on altruistic behavior, without a Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM). This study aims to address this gap by exploring how multiple proposers should be rewarded to incentivize censorship resistance. The main contribution of this work is the identification of TFMs that ensure censorship resistance under bribery attacks, while also satisfying the incentive compatibility properties of EIP-1559. We provide a concrete payment mechanism for FOCIL, along with generalizable contributions to the literature by analyzing 1) incentive compatibility of TFMs in the presence of a bribing adversary, 2) TFMs in protocols with multiple phases of transaction inclusion, and 3) TFMs of protocols in which parties are uncertain about the behavior and the possible bribe of others.</description>

      <title>Monopoly Deal: A Benchmark Environment for Bounded One-Sided Response Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Card games are widely used to study sequential decision-making under uncertainty, with real-world analogues in negotiation, finance, and cybersecurity. These games typically fall into three categories based on the flow of control: strictly sequential (players alternate single actions), deterministic response (some actions trigger a fixed outcome), and unbounded reciprocal response (alternating counterplays are permitted). A less-explored but strategically rich structure is the bounded one-sided response, where a player's action briefly transfers control to the opponent, who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more moves before the turn resolves. We term games featuring this mechanism Bounded One-Sided Response Games (BORGs). We introduce a modified version of Monopoly Deal as a benchmark environment that isolates this dynamic, where a Rent action forces the opponent to choose payment assets. The gold-standard algorithm, Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), converges on effective strategies without novel algorithmic extensions. A lightweight full-stack research platform unifies the environment, a parallelized CFR runtime, and a human-playable web interface. The trained CFR agent and source code are available at https://monopolydeal.ai.</description>
