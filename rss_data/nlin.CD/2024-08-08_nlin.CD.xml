      <title>Classification of synchronization in nonlinear systems using ICO learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the implications of the differential Hebbian learning rule known as Input-Correlations (ICO) learning in the classification of synchronization in coupled nonlinear oscillator systems. We are investigating the parity-time symmetric coupled Duffing oscillator system with nonlinear dissipation/amplification. In our investigation of the temporal dynamics of this system, it is observed that the system exhibits chaotic as well as quasiperiodic dynamics. On further investigation, it is found that the chaotic dynamics is distorted anti-phase synchronized, whereas the quasiperiodic dynamics is desynchronized. So, on the application of the ICO learning in these two parametric regimes, we observe that the weight associated with the stimulus remains constant when the oscillators are anti-phase synchronized, in spite of there being distortion in the synchronization. But when the oscillators exhibit quasiperiodic dynamics, there is erratic evolution of the weight with time. So, from this, it could be ascertained that the ICO learning could be made use of in the classification of synchronization dynamics in nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order Correlators and Chaos in Quantum Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine three billiard systems -- the cardioid, diamond (Superman), and Sinai billiards -- all of which are known to be classically chaotic. We compute their classical Lyapunov exponents, and using out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in the semi-classical regime, we also derive their quantum Lyapunov exponents. We observe that the classical and quantum Lyapunov exponents are in agreement, strengthening the role of OTOCs as a diagnostic for quantum chaos in billiard systems. At very low temperatures, the OTOC of the Sinai billiard shows sharp growth, a phenomenon absent in the other two billiards. We identify the source of this anomalous behaviour in the geometry of the ground state wave function of the Sinai billiard, which is more sensitive to the curvature of the billiard compared to the other billiards. We also remark on the late-time behaviour of the OTOCs and how the scrambling/Ehrenfest time is related to the temperature of quantum billiards.</description>

      <title>Contraction and Synchronization in Reservoir Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the conditions under which global contraction manifests in the leaky continuous time reservoirs, thus guaranteeing Generalized Synchronization. Results on continuous time reservoirs make use of the logarithmic norm of the connectivity matrix. Further analysis yields some simple guidelines on how to better construct the connectivity matrix in these systems. Additionally, we outline how the Universal Approximation Property of discrete time reservoirs is readily satisfied by virtue of the activation function being contracting, and how continuous time reservoirs may inherit a limited form of universal approximation by virtue of them overlapping with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. The ability of the Reservoir Computing framework to universally approximate topological conjugates, along with their fast training, make them a compelling data-driven, black-box surrogate of dynamical systems, and a potential mechanism for developing digital twins.</description>

      <title>Beyond Nearest-neighbour Universality of Spectral Fluctuations in Quantum Chaotic and Complex Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discerning chaos in quantum systems is an important problem as the usual route of Lyapunov exponents in classical systems is not straightforward in quantum systems. A standard route is the comparison of statistics derived from model physical systems to those from random matrix theory (RMT) ensembles, of which the most popular is the nearest-neighbour-spacings distribution (NNSD), which almost always shows good agreement with chaotic quantum systems. However, even in these cases, the long-range statistics (like number variance, spectral rigidity etc.), which are also more difficult to calculate, often show disagreements with RMT. As such, a more stringent test for chaos in quantum systems, via an analysis of intermediate-range statistics is needed, which will additionally assess the extent of agreement with RMT universality. In this paper, we deduce the effective level-repulsion parameters and the corresponding Wigner-surmise-like results of the next-nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (nNNSD) for integrable systems (semi-Poissonian statistics) as well as the three classical quantum-chaotic Wigner-Dyson regimes, by stringent comparisons to numerical RMT models and benchmarking against our exact analytical results for $3\times 3$ Gaussian matrix models, along with a semi-analytical form for the nNNSD in the Orthogonal-to-Unitary symmetry crossover. To illustrate the robustness of these RMT based results, we test these predictions against the nNNSD obtained from quantum chaotic models as well as disordered lattice spin models. This reinforces the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit and the Berry-Tabor conjectures, extending the associated universality to longer range statistics. In passing, we also highlight the equivalence of nNNSD in the apparently distinct Orthogonal-to-Unitary and diluted-Symplectic-to-Unitary crossovers.</description>

      <title>Chaotic and Thermal Aspects in the Highly Excited String S-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute tree level scattering amplitudes involving more than one highly excited states and tachyons in bosonic string theory. We use these amplitudes to understand chaotic and thermal aspects of the excited string states lending support to the Susskind-Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence principle. The unaveraged amplitudes exhibit chaos in the resonance distribution as a function of kinematic parameters, which can be described by random matrix theory. Upon coarse-graining these amplitudes are shown to exponentiate, and capture various thermal features, including features of a stringy version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as notions of typicality. Further, we compute the effective string form factor corresponding to the highly excited states, and argue for the random walk behaviour of the long strings.</description>
