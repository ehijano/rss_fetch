      <title>Multivariate Fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Isometric Spectral Subtriples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of subsystem in the framework of spectral triple as a generalized notion of noncommutative submanifold. In the case of manifolds, we consider several conditions on Dirac operators which turn embedded submanifolds into isometric submanifolds. We then suggest a definition of spectral subtriple based on the notion of submanifold algebra and the already existing notions of Riemannian, isometric, and totally geodesic morphisms. We have shown that our definitions work at least in some relevant almost commutative examples.</description>

      <title>Multiple operator integrals, pseudodifferential calculus, and asymptotic expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We push the definition of multiple operator integrals (MOIs) into the realm of unbounded operators, using the pseudodifferential calculus from the works of Connes and Moscovici, Higson, and Guillemin. This in particular provides a natural language for operator integrals in noncommutative geometry. For this purpose, we develop a functional calculus for these pseudodifferential operators. To illustrate the power of this framework, we provide a pertubative expansion of the spectral action for regular $s$-summable spectral triples $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D)$, and an asymptotic expansion of $\mathrm{Tr}(P e^{-t(D+V)^2})$ as $t \downarrow 0$, where $P$ and $V$ belong to the algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$ and $D$, and $V$ is bounded and self-adjoint.</description>
