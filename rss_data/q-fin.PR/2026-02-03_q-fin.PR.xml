      <title>Keeping Up with the Correlations: Stochastic Spot/Volatility Correlation and Exotic Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a novel use case for the Double Heston model (Christoffersen et al,, 2009), where the two Heston sub-variances have different spot/volatility correlations but the same volatility of volatility and mean reversion speed.
  This parameterization generalizes the traditional Heston stochastic volatility model (Heston, 1993) to include stochastic spot/volatility correlation. It is an affine model, allowing European options to be priced efficiently by numerically integrating over a closed-form characteristic function.
  This model incorporates a key dynamic relevant for pricing barrier derivatives in the foreign exchange markets: a positive correlation between moves in implied volatility skew and moves in the spot price. We analyze that correlation and its impact on both barrier option pricing and volatility swap pricing. Those price impacts are comparable to or larger than the bid/ask spreads for these products.
  Adding stochastic spot/volatility correlation increases the prices of out-of-the-money knockout options and one touch options, assuming that the model is calibrated to market vanilla option prices. It also increases the fair strike of volatility swaps compared to the Heston model.</description>

      <title>Random neural networks for rough volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a deep learning-based numerical algorithm to solve path-dependent partial differential equations arising in the context of rough volatility. Our approach is based on interpreting the PDE as a solution to an BSDE, building upon recent insights by Bayer, Qiu and Yao, and on constructing a neural network of reservoir type as originally developed by Gonon, Grigoryeva, Ortega. The reservoir approach allows us to formulate the optimisation problem as a simple least-square regression for which we prove theoretical convergence properties.</description>
