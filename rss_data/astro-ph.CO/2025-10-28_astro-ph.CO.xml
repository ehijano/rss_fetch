      <title>Analytic Marginalization over Binary Variables in Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many data analyses, each measurement may come with a simple yes/no correction; for example, belonging to one of two populations or being contaminated or not. Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>XRISM constraints on the velocity power spectrum in the Coma cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity field of intracluster gas in galaxy clusters contains key information on the virialization of infalling material, the dissipation of AGN energy into the surrounding medium, and the validity of the hydrostatic hypothesis. The statistical properties of the velocity field are characterized by its fluctuation power spectrum, which is usually expected to be well described by an injection scale and a turbulent cascade. Here we propose a simulation-based inference technique to retrieve the properties of the velocity power spectrum from X-ray micro-calorimeter data by generating simulations of Gaussian random fields from a parametric power spectrum model. We forward model the measured bulk velocities and velocity dispersions by including the most relevant observational effects (projection, emissivity weighting, PSF smearing). We then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the power spectrum parameters and the generated data vectors. Considering a three-parameter model describing turbulent energy injection on large scales and a power-law cascade, we found that two XRISM/Resolve pointings are sufficient to accurately determine the turbulent Mach number and set interesting constraints on the injection scale. Applying our method to the Coma cluster data, we obtain a model that is characterized by a large injection scale that rivals the size of the cluster ($\ell_{inj}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+2.0}$ Mpc). When this power spectrum model is integrated over the cluster scales ($0&lt;\ell&lt;R_{500}=1.4 $Mpc), the Mach number of the gas motions is $\mathcal{M}_{3D,500}=0.45_{-0.13}^{+0.18}$, which exceeds the value derived from the velocity dispersions only. Further observations covering a wider area are required to decrease the cosmic variance and constrain the slope of the turbulent cascade.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Diffuse Radio Emission in Low-Mass Cluster: Abell 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in high-sensitivity radio observations have uncovered a population of faint, ultra-steep-spectrum sources in galaxy clusters, commonly known as radio phoenixes. However, their observational classification remains poorly constrained due to the limited number of confirmed detections. This study presents a detailed multi-frequency, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution analysis of diffuse radio emission in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 13. Using GMRT (147.5 MHz), uGMRT (400 MHz), ASKAP-low (887.5 MHz), and MGCLS (1284 MHz) images, we detect complex, filamentary diffuse emission with a largest linear extent of 521 kpc. This emission originates from the cluster center and extends westward, confined within the X-ray-emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM). Chandra X-ray data confirm that Abell 13 is undergoing a merger, and the radio morphology reflects signatures of this ongoing dynamical activity. We observed filamentary structures extending towards east-northeast and southwest directions. The spectral index across the emission appears irregular and lacks a coherent spatial gradient. The integrated spectrum reveals a steep spectral index of -1.85 +/- 0.05 and a spectral curvature of -0.93 +/- 0.21. These spectral properties, along with the observed morphology and brightness distribution, are consistent with a re-energization of a fossil radio plasma driven by adiabatic compression, supporting the classification of the emission as a radio phoenix.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Meets Varying Electron Mass: Implications for Phantom Crossing and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dynamical Dark Energy using DESI DR2 Ly$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the cosmological implications of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) Lyman-$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with complementary datasets DESI DR2 galaxy BAO, Type Ia supernova (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, and Union3), and compressed CMB likelihood. We test several dynamical dark energy models CPL, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE as well as $\omega$CDM and non-flat extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models. Using the Metropolis Hastings MCMC algorithm implemented in \texttt{SimpleMC}, we constrain the cosmological parameters of each model and evaluate the Bayesian evidence using \texttt{MCEvidence} to assess each model's performance relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show that the inclusion of DESI DR2 Ly$\alpha$ data modestly enhances sensitivity to departures from $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show non-flat extensions remain consistent with spatial flatness ($\Omega_k \approx 0$ within $1$-$2\sigma$). Further, all redshift dependent dark energy models predict $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$, favor a dynamical dark energy scenario characterized by Quintom-B type, and we found that dynamical dark energy favors over the $\Lambda$CDM model ranging from 0.24-2.60$\sigma$, depending on the choice of model and corresponding combination of datasets. Bayesian evidence comparison favors the $\omega$CDM model with moderate evidence over $\Lambda$CDM, whereas other parameterizations remain statistically inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble Constant using Cross-Correlation of Gravitational Wave Events with Flux-Limited Galaxy Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary coalescence provide direct measurement of the luminosity distance to the event. However, unlike binary neutron stars, redshift information is not available from GW observations of binary black holes. Consequently, independent redshift measurements of such GW events are necessary to measure $H_0$. In this study, we demonstrate a novel Bayesian formalism to infer $H_0$ utilizing the $3$D cross-correlation of GW events with galaxies from flux-limited catalog in configuration space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $300$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\sim 9 \%$ ($90\%$ highest density interval). We highlight the potential improvements that need to be accounted for in further studies before the method can be applied to real data.</description>

      <title>Avoiding PBH overproduction in inflation model with modified dispersion relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data of nano-Hertz gravitational waves released in 2023 implies that if such gravitational waves comes from the scalar perturbation induction at the end of inflation, the accompanied primordial black holes (PBHs) will be over-produced, with the fraction exceed the upper bound of unity. This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem", which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\sigma$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1\sigma$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$. The mass distribution of the PBHs generated is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing Axion-Photon conversion via circular polarization imprints in the CMB $V$-mode observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of a background magnetic field, axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) can be resonantly converted to photons when their mass is nearly equal to the effective photon mass. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the parameter space of ALPs by investigating the resulting imprints of axion-photon conversion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We show that a helical magnetic field existing prior to the CMB epoch can generate an excess population of photons carrying net circular polarization due to the axion-photon conversion mechanism. Consequently, current measurements of the angular power spectrum of circular polarization ($V$-mode) in the CMB can be used to constrain the parameter space of ALP mass and its coupling to photons. In the optimistic scenario of a maximally helical magnetic field with strength $\sim {\rm nG}$, we find that CLASS observations at $40 \, {\rm GHz}$ can probe the previously unconstrained regions of axion-photon coupling corresponding to ALP masses in the range $10^{-10}-10^{-8} \, {\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic magnification on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing magnification probes the correlation between galaxies and the underlying matter field in a similar fashion to galaxy-galaxy lensing shear. Although it has long been sidelined in favor of the latter on the grounds of a poorer performance in terms of statistical significance, the provision of a large sample of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies by the \emph{Herschel} observatory has transformed the landscape of cosmic magnification due to their optimal physical properties for magnification analyses. This review aims to summarize the core principles and unique advantages of cosmic magnification on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies and discuss recent results applied for cosmological inference. The outlook and challenges of this observable are also outlined, with a focus on the ample scope for exploration and its potential to emerge as a competitive independent cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Discriminating Between Models of the Nanohertz Gravitational-Wave Background with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array results, including the NANOGrav 15-year data set, show evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) in the nanohertz band. We present a Bayesian framework to compare three possible origins: (i) a background from supermassive black hole binary mergers, (ii) a first-order phase transition in the early Universe, and (iii) a network of cosmic strings. We derive the PTA likelihood with the Hellings-Downs angular correlation and model intrinsic pulsar red noise and dispersion-measure variations. Using Bayesian model selection, we infer posteriors for the GWB amplitude and spectral slope and compute marginal likelihoods for each scenario. We confirm a common-spectrum process with Hellings-Downs spatial correlations and recover a characteristic strain amplitude at f_yr = 1/year of A_GWB approx 2.4e-15, with a slope consistent with gamma approx 13/3 as expected for supermassive black hole binaries. While fully consistent with an astrophysical origin, cosmological sources are not excluded: cosmic strings with Gmu ~ 1e-11 to 1e-10 and phase transitions peaking near 1e-8 to 1e-7 Hz can reproduce the observed amplitude within allowed parameter ranges. Current Bayes factors do not show a decisive preference among these scenarios. We discuss noise-mitigation implications and prospects for discrimination with future PTA observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) using the arbitrary redshift pivot Pad\'e-(2,1) expansion methodology developed in arXiv:2509.16196. This approach allows us to constrain cosmographic parameters and test CDDR at a particular redshift. Further, it does not rely on data reconstructions or extrapolations of the cosmographic parameters to higher redshifts. We employ observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Baryon Acoustic Oscillation dataset, cosmic chronometers, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus and Dark Energy Survey Year 5 compilations. We find no significant deviations from the standard CDDR relation, with constraints reaching sub-percent precision across most redshifts in the range $0\lesssim z \lesssim 1$.</description>

      <title>Constraining and Comparing the Dynamical Dark Energy and f(R) Modified Gravity Models with Cosmological Distance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain and compare the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM dynamical dark energy model and three $f(R)$ modified gravity models using the current cosmological distance measurements, including 112 high-quality localized FRBs, BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI-DR2) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 12 (BOSS-DR12), SNe Ia from the PantheonPlus compilation and the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) sample, cosmic chronometers (CC), and the angular scale of the first acoustic peak of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from Planck 2018. These datasets allow us to effectively break parameter degeneracy, obtain stringent cosmological constraint results, and conduct systematic model comparison and selection. By using the FRB+PantheonPlus+DESI+CC+CMB dataset, we constrain the parameters of the dark energy equation of state in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, obtaining $w_{0} = -0.866 \pm 0.060$ and $w_{a} = -0.37^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$. For the $f(R)$ modified gravity models, the deviation parameter $b$, which characterizes departure from general relativity, is constrained to be $b = 0.199 \pm 0.082$, $b = 0.690^{+0.200}_{-0.130}$, and $b = 0.193 \pm 0.080$ for Hu-Sawicki, Starobinsky, and ArcTanh models, respectively. Besides, we compare the impacts of different SNe Ia datasets (PantheonPlus and DESY5) and BAO datasets (DESI-DR2 and BOSS-DR12) on the constraints of the cosmological models. By employing Bayesian evidence and other model selection criteria, we find that the choice of SNe Ia and BAO datasets can significantly influence the inferred preference for cosmological models. Specifically, the DESY5 and DESI datasets tend to favor $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $f(R)$ models, whereas the PantheonPlus and BOSS datasets show a comparatively stronger preference for the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>The role of supercluster filaments in shaping galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM Universe, cosmic filaments serve as the primary channels for matter accretion into galaxy clusters, influencing the shape of their dark matter halos. We investigate whether the elongation of galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments, providing the first observational test of this relationship in large supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the alignment between filament directions -- traced by galaxy distributions -- and the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials -- traced by X-ray emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($&gt; 1.6 r_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters. We propose this measurement as a simple observational proxy to determine the direction of accretion in clusters, which is key to understanding both galaxy evolution and the merger history of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction shear and rotation in Chaplygin cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we build upon the findings of Del Popolo et al. (2013) by further analyzing the influence of dynamical friction on the evolution of cosmological perturbations within the framework of the spherical collapse model (SCM) in a Universe dominated by generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). Specifically, we investigate how dynamical friction alters the growth rate of density perturbations, the effective sound speed, the equation-of-state parameter www, and the evolution of the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that dynamical friction significantly delays the collapse process compared to the standard SCM. Accurate computation of these parameters is crucial for obtaining consistent results and reliable physical interpretations when employing the GCG model. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the suppression of perturbation growth due to dynamical friction is considerably more pronounced than that caused by shear and rotation, as previously indicated by Del Popolo et al. (2013). This enhanced suppression effectively addresses the instability issues, such as oscillations or exponential divergences in the dark-matter power spectrum, highlighted in linear perturbation studies, such as those by Sandvik et al. (2004).</description>

      <title>Discovery of SN 2025wny: a Strongly Gravitationally Lensed Superluminous Supernova at z = 2.01</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of SN 2025wny (ZTF25abnjznp/GOTO25gtq) and spectroscopic classification of this event as the first gravitationally lensed Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I). Deep ground-based follow-up observations resolves four images of the supernova with ~1.7" angular separation from the main lens galaxy, each coincident with the lensed images of a background galaxy seen in archival imaging of the field. Spectroscopy of the brightest point image shows narrow features matching absorption lines at a redshift of z = 2.011 and broad features matching those seen in superluminous SNe with Far-UV coverage. We infer a magnification factor of 20 to 50 for the brightest image in the system, based on photometric and spectroscopic comparisons to other SLSNe-I. SN 2025wny demonstrates that gravitationally-lensed SNe are in reach of ground-based facilities out to redshifts far higher than what has been previously assumed, and provide a unique window into studying distant supernovae, internal properties of dwarf galaxies, as well as for time-delay cosmography.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Clustering-redshifts and importance sampling of Self-Organised-Maps $n(z)$ realizations for $3\times2$pt samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is part of a series establishing the redshift framework for the $3\times2$pt analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6). For DES Y6, photometric redshift distributions are estimated using self-organizing maps (SOMs), calibrated with spectroscopic and many-band photometric data. To overcome limitations from color-redshift degeneracies and incomplete spectroscopic coverage, we enhance this approach by incorporating clustering-based redshift constraints (clustering-z, or WZ) from angular cross-correlations with BOSS and eBOSS galaxies, and eBOSS quasar samples. We define a WZ likelihood and apply importance sampling to a large ensemble of SOM-derived $n(z)$ realizations, selecting those consistent with the clustering measurements to produce a posterior sample for each lens and source bin. The analysis uses angular scales of 1.5-5 Mpc to optimize signal-to-noise while mitigating modeling uncertainties, and marginalizes over redshift-dependent galaxy bias and other systematics informed by the N-body simulation Cardinal. While a sparser spectroscopic reference sample limits WZ constraining power at $z&gt;1.1$, particularly for source bins, we demonstrate that combining SOMPZ with WZ improves redshift accuracy and enhances the overall cosmological constraining power of DES Y6. We estimate an improvement in $S_8$ of approximately 10\% for cosmic shear and $3\times2$pt analysis, primarily due to the WZ calibration of the source samples.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Redshift Calibration of the Weak Lensing Source Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the distribution of redshifts for galaxies in wide-field photometric surveys is essential for robust cosmological studies of weak gravitational lensing. We present the methodology, calibrated redshift distributions, and uncertainties of the final Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (Y6) weak lensing galaxy data, divided into four redshift bins centered at $\langle z \rangle = [0.414, 0.538, 0.846, 1.157]$. We combine independent information from two methods on the full shape of redshift distributions: optical and near-infrared photometry within an improved Self-Organizing Map $p(z)$ (SOMPZ) framework, and cross-correlations with spectroscopic galaxy clustering measurements (WZ), which we demonstrate to be consistent both in terms of the redshift calibration itself and in terms of resulting cosmological constraints within 0.1$\sigma$. We describe the process used to produce an ensemble of redshift distributions that account for several known sources of uncertainty. Among these, imperfection in the calibration sample due to the lack of faint, representative spectra is the dominant factor. The final uncertainty on mean redshift in each bin is $\sigma_{\langle z\rangle} = [0.012, 0.008,0.009, 0.024]$. We ensure the robustness of the redshift distributions by leveraging new image simulations and a cross-check with galaxy shape information via the shear ratio (SR) method.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results IV. A stack on eBOSS/DESI quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stack of data from the second season of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder on the positions of quasars from eBOSS and DESI. COMAP is a Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiment targeting dense molecular gas via CO(1--0) emission at $z\sim3$. COMAP's Season 2 represents a $3\times$ increase in map-level sensitivity over the previous Early Science data release. We do not detect any CO emission in the stack, instead finding an upper limit of $10.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{K\ km\ s^{-1}\ pc^2}$ at 95\% confidence within an $\sim 18\ \mathrm{cMpc}$ box. We compare this upper limit to models of the CO emission stacked on quasars and find a tentative ($\sim 3 \sigma$) tension between the limit and the brightest stack models after accounting for a suite of additional sources of experimental attenuation and uncertainty, including quasar velocity uncertainty, pipeline signal loss, cosmic variance, and interloper emission in the LIM data. The COMAP-eBOSS/DESI stack is primarily a measurement of the CO luminosity in the quasars' wider environment and is therefore potentially subject to environmental effects such as feedback. With our current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to confidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely, the stack's sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the potential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are able to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key goal of COMAP).</description>

      <title>Cosmic magnification on multi-catalogue Herschel submillimetre galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are excellent background sources for magnification-bias studies, but the limited sky coverage in the submillimetre (sub-mm) band constrains their statistical power. Beyond H-ATLAS, Herschel produced additional sub-mm catalogues, though not optimised for spatial statistical lensing analyses.} {Our goal is to refine cosmological constraints from SMG magnification bias by exploiting the full sub-mm sky surveyed by Herschel.} {We expanded the SMG sample by incorporating other Herschel catalogues overlapping SDSS spectroscopic lenses. Random catalogues were generated via kernel density estimation to compute cross-correlations, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were applied to infer astrophysical and cosmological parameters for each catalogue and for the combined dataset.} {We report the first detection of magnification bias in SMGs beyond H-ATLAS, reinforcing the robustness of this observable. Individual Herschel catalogues yield reasonable central values for $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, although with large uncertainties. The combined analysis, dominated by the more powerful H-ATLAS sample, gives results consistent with $\Lambda$CDM: $\Omega_m = 0.30^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$, $\sigma_8 = 0.80 (+/- 0.07)$, and $h &lt; 0.80$, in better agreement with \textit{Planck} 2018 than previous non-tomographic studies.} {SMGs are promising tracers for magnification bias, but the narrow sub-mm coverage remains a major limitation. Wider surveys optimised for lensing would enable cross-correlations on larger scales, yielding tighter cosmological constraints.}</description>

      <title>The Compressed 3D Lyman-Alpha Forest Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k &lt;= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced) field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.</description>

      <title>How to Build an Empirical Speed Distribution for Dark Matter in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter flux in a direct detection experiment depends on its local speed distribution. This distribution has been inferred from simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no simulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This motivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from observations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the dark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find that the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent non-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile, recently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be traced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar populations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark matter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good alignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these two contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter speeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize stellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from the Milky Way's last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Baryogenesis with \texttt{BARYONET}: a self-contained review of the WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, self-contained pedagogical computation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG), from the derivation of the semiclassical, CP-dependent force to the formulation and solution of the transport equations obtained from the Boltzmann equations$-$all implemented in the open-source code \texttt{BARYONET}. Our analysis follows the semiclassical WKB approach, where spatially varying complex masses across expanding bubble walls feel CP-violating forces that bias plasma transport. Starting from the stationary Boltzmann equation in the wall frame and projecting onto a hierarchy of velocity moments, we derive a compact, fluid-like system of coupled differential equations for chemical potentials and velocity perturbations. After obtaining the solutions, one can define the left-handed baryon chemical potential, which acts as the source term for the weak sphalerons. These processes generate the baryon asymmetry in front of the wall, which is subsequently frozen once it passes through it.
  We validate the framework against established formalisms and provide benchmarks in representative scenarios, including singlet extensions of the Standard Model, two-Higgs-doublet models, and Higgs$-\phi^6$ constructions. The resulting \texttt{BARYONET} implementation delivers an automated, reproducible pipeline for WKB-based baryogenesis studies, connecting formal derivations with phenomenological applications.
  In parallel, we revisit standard EWBG ingredients$-$\emph{diffusion constants}, \emph{Yukawa/helicity-flip rates}, and \emph{strong/weak sphaleron rates}$-$to clarify conventions, update numerical inputs, and present a pedagogical derivation, ensuring transparent reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Superhorizon Isocurvature as a Window into Dark Matter Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of primordial isocurvature perturbations, for example in a separate dark radiation sector, the superhorizon evolution of curvature perturbations becomes nontrivial. If the dark sector is radiation-like and constitutes a significant fraction of the energy density, its isocurvature can imply isocurvature in the inflaton sector even without direct interactions between the sectors. In this article, we revisit superhorizon curvature and isocurvature evolution in the long-wavelength limit systematically, drawing a simple picture of how to understand the nature of these fluctuations from first principles and without brute-force cosmic perturbation theory. We show how the described setup is able to source isocurvature in simple models of dark matter such as freeze-in and freeze-out and demonstrate that future measurements of matter and neutrino isocurvature can potentially discriminate between these two mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Suppressed "lump" EM signature in radiation pressure dominated accreting massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on electromagnetic signatures of accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We model binaries embedded in a self-gravitating circumbinary disc that evolves following an adiabatic equation of state, including viscous heating and black-body cooling. Focusing on binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q=1, 0.7$, we find that radiation pressure significantly affects both the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the light curves (LCs). The emission from the mini-discs shifts from the optical towards UV frequencies and with a peak luminosity orders of magnitude higher, while the circumbinary disc becomes colder and dimmer as a result of its geometrically thinner configuration. Temporal variability is affected as well: near UV and soft-X ray fluxes are higher and more variable. Crucially, radiation pressure suppresses the characteristic "lump" formation in equal-mass circular systems, while a lump is formed for higher eccentricities without imprinting any modulation on the flux. In the circular case we still find a modulation on the cavity edge timescale at a frequency $0.36 \, f_{\rm K}$, while in eccentric binaries, only robust orbital period modulations ($f=1,2 \, f_{\rm K}$) are observed, with no modulation associated with the cavity orbital motion. Moreover, the enhanced emission from the mini-discs and streams due to radiation pressure, one redshifted, results in brighter flux in the optical G band, proving detectability of MBHBs signatures even at higher redshift ($z=0.6-1.0$). Our results reveal that radiation pressure plays a crucial role in shaping MBHBs spectral and time-domain features, with implications for their identification in time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity with out-of-equilibrium corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how out-of-equilibrium effects modify the steady-state propagation of bubble walls during a cosmological first-order electroweak phase transition. Going beyond the local thermal equilibrium approximation, we numerically solve the coupled system of scalar field, hydrodynamic and Boltzmann equations using a spectral algorithm that allows a first-principle treatment of the collision integral. This approach enables a quantitative assessment of non-equilibrium perturbations in the plasma and their backreaction on the wall motion. Focusing on the singlet extension of the Standard Model as a minimal benchmark scenario, we find that out-of-equilibrium corrections substantially enhance the effective friction on the expanding front, leading to slower wall velocities and broader wall profiles compared to the equilibrium case. These modifications have significant implications for cosmological observables. For instance, they enhance the efficiency of electroweak baryogenesis, thus improving the viability of baryon asymmetry generation within realistic parameter regions that can also be probed by future gravitational wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Tracing The Start and End of Cosmic Reionization -- Exploring The Role of Ionizing Sources as drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the Epoch of Cosmic Reionization (EoR), a key period in the early Universe when the first luminous sources formed and their radiation transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to ionized. Understanding this process reveals how the first stars and galaxies formed, influenced their surroundings, and shaped large-scale structures. The work traces both hydrogen and helium reionization by identifying the sources that produced ionizing radiation and examining how this radiation affected the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. Using the SPICE cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the first part analyzes the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of high-redshift galaxies. It shows that different supernova feedback models drive distinct UVLF variability across mass and redshift, potentially alleviating the bright-galaxy tension seen by JWST. The second part explores how spectra from ionizing sources i.e. single and binary stars, X-ray binaries, emission from the interstellar medium, and active galactic nuclei impact the timing, topology, and thermal history of hydrogen reionization and the Lyman-alpha forest. At lower redshifts, radiative-transfer simulations reveal how helium reionization driven by quasars progressed and how the timing and temperature of the IGM relate to quasar luminosity functions and He II Ly-alpha observations. Finally, predictions for the 3.5 cm hyperfine transition of singly ionized helium-3 offer a novel probe of the post-reionization IGM. Together, these studies combine galaxy formation, radiative processes, and IGM evolution to provide a coherent picture of cosmic reionization and its observable signatures.</description>

      <title>RGC: a radio AGN classifier based on deep learning. I. A semi-supervised model for the VLA images of bent radio AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-angle tail (WAT) and narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio active galactic nuclei (RAGNs) are key tracers of dense environments in galaxy groups and clusters, yet no machine-learning classifier of bent RAGNs has been trained using both unlabeled data and purely visually inspected labels. We release the RGC Python package, which includes two newly preprocessed labeled datasets of 639 WATs and NATs derived from a publicly available catalog of visually inspected sources, along with a semi-supervised RGC model that leverages 20,000 unlabeled RAGNs. The two labeled datasets in RGC were preprocessed using PyBDSF which retains spurious sources, and Photutils which removes them. The RGC model integrates the self-supervised framework BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) with the supervised E2CNN (E2-equivariant Convolutional Neural Network) to form a semi-supervised binary classifier. The RGC model, when trained and evaluated on a dataset devoid of spurious sources, reaches peak performance, attaining an accuracy of 88.88% along with F1-scores of 0.90 for WATs and 0.85 for NATs. The model's attention patterns amid class imbalance suggest that this work can serve as a stepping stone toward developing physics-informed foundation models capable of identifying a broad range of AGN physical properties.</description>

      <title>The Ultra Slow-Roll Phase Of Warm Inflation In Braneworld Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow-roll of the inflaton (inflationary field) defines the standard dynamics of the inflationary epoch. However, the inflaton deviates from slow-roll when it encounters an extremely flat region in the inflationary potential, and enters a phase dubbed Ultra Slow Roll (USR). In previous studies, there have been various theories which modify the theory of general relativity, all of them having different motivations based on different paradigms. Among these, braneworld gravity, motivated from string theory; is one of the most prominent theories as it provides a geometrical explanation for the weakness of gravity. In this article, we explore two possible braneworld background theories, the Randall-Sundrum (RS-II) model and the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porratai (DGP) model, and then realize an USR phase in a particularly interesting inflationary scenario, called warm inflation. In the warm inflationary scenario, a thermal radiation bath coexists with the inflationary energy density as an effect of the dissipative dynamics. We then derive inflationary slow roll parameters and the primordial power spectrum of scalar curvature perturbations in such a setup. We then numerically investigate the evolution of the inflaton and the primordial power spectrum of scalar curvature perturbations. Our analysis shows that the braneworld contributions become progressively suppressed as the USR conditions are made more stringent, indicating that the USR phase effectively diminishes brane-induced corrections to standard inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The instantaneous elastic response of gravitational perturbations to the thermal plasma can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early universe. The obstacle is that there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this contact term, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the thermal initial state on a perturbed FLRW background. Diffeomorphism and Weyl invariance allow the (grand) canonical ensemble, defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that break the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis, providing a nontrivial consistency check and a robust basis for quantum-field-theoretic treatments of gravitational perturbations in thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Refined Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supernova (SN) core, characterized by its extreme temperature and density, serves as a unique laboratory for new-physics searches. Low-energy supernovae (LESNe) provide particularly powerful probes, as their low explosion energies place stringent limits on any additional energy deposition in the mantle by new particles. We present refined LESN constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) with electron-muon couplings. We consider four production channels in the SN: muon decay, lepton bremsstrahlung, electron-muon coalescence, and semi-Compton scattering, the last of which is investigated here for the first time in the context of LFV-ALPs. We find that muon decay dominates in the low-mass regime, electron-muon coalescence in the high-mass regime, and semi-Compton scattering in the intermediate-mass range. To derive accurate limits, we compute both the energy transfer from the SN core to the mantle and the energy loss due to ALP production in the mantle, which can be substantial for both large and small couplings -- the latter case, to our knowledge, not previously noted in the literature. We find that LESNe provide the most stringent constraints on the parameter space for ALP masses above $\sim 110$ MeV. These refined results strengthen previous SN bounds and highlight the exceptional sensitivity of LESNe to LFV new physics.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of Multi-Component Axion Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mechanism for multi-component dark matter (DM) that originates from axion mixing. In this context, multi-component DM implies that the cold DM is composed of the QCD axion and many ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs). This framework can be realized in the type IIB string axiverse with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants. Our investigation reveals that in the light QCD axion scenario, the energy density of the lightest ALP often dominates after mixing, invalidating the canonical light axion scenario. On the other hand, in the heavy QCD axion scenario, both the QCD axion and non-lightest ALPs may dominate, depending on the ALP decay constants. Under certain conditions, the canonical heavy axion scenario remains valid. Finally, we briefly discuss a theoretical framework featuring $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ axions, with hierarchical axion masses and decay constants.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from collapsing domain walls with full general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of isolated closed domain walls with 3+1 numerical relativity. A closed wall shrinks due to its own surface tension, and its surface energy is converted to the kinetic energy, leading to implosion. Then, it can result in the formation of a black hole. First, we focus on spherically symmetric closed domain walls and clarify whether they finally evolve into black holes. Naively, the wall can collapse if its thickness is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius which is determined by the initial surface energy. Our numerical results support this naive criterion for the black hole formation, and indicate that more than 80% of the initial wall energy falls into the black hole. We also investigate the nonspherical collapse by considering the ellipsoidal configurations for the closed domain walls, and it turns out that black holes can be formed even when the ratio of semi-major to semi-minor axes is 1.5.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Landscape of Spontaneous CP Violation in Supersymmetric Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong CP problem remains one of the most important unresolved issues in the Standard Model. Spontaneous CP violation (SCPV) is a promising approach to the problem by assuming that CP is an exact symmetry of the Lagrangian but broken spontaneously at the vacuum, which enables the generation of the observed Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phase without reintroducing a nonzero strong CP phase. Supersymmetry (SUSY) provides a natural framework to accommodate such a mechanism, as SUSY can not only protect the scale of SCPV from radiative corrections but also suppress problematic higher-dimensional operators generating a strong CP phase. In the present study, we explore the realization of SCPV in two distinct SUSY scenarios. First, we investigate SCPV in the exact SUSY limit, extending the spurion formalism developed in non-supersymmetric theories and introducing a method to determine whether the given superpotential satisfies the necessary condition for SCPV. Second, we construct a model in which CP is spontaneously broken at an intermediate scale along pseudo-flat directions, stabilized by soft SUSY breaking and non-perturbative effects of a gauge theory. The latter setup predicts light scalars in the SCPV sector whose masses are determined by the SUSY breaking scale.</description>

      <title>Lensing, not luck! Detection prospects of strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by ground-based observatories will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters. This may produce multiple copies of the signals (i.e., lensed images) arriving at different times at the detector. These, if observed, could offer new probes of astrophysics and cosmology. However, identification of lensed image pairs among a large number of unrelated GW events is challenging. Though the number of lensed events increases with improved detector sensitivity, the false alarms increase quadratically faster. While this "lensing or luck" problem would appear to be insurmountable, we show that the expected increase in measurement precision of source parameters will efficiently weed out false alarms. Based on current astrophysical models and anticipated sensitivities, we predict that the first confident detection could occur in the fifth observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We expect computational costs to be a major hurdle in achieving such a detection, and show that the Posterior Overlap 2.0 method may offer a near-optimal solution to this challenge.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: The HI mass-stellar mass relation of massive galaxies and the HI mass function at 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the already formed stellar mass in a galaxy and the gas reservoir of neutral atomic hydrogen, is a key element in our understanding of how gas is turned into stars in galaxy haloes. In this paper, we measure the $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relation based on a stellar-mass selected sample at $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.5$ and the MIGHTEE-HI DR1 spectral data. Using a powerful Bayesian stacking technique, for the first time we are also able to measure the underlying bivariate distribution of HI mass and stellar mass of galaxies with $M_\star &gt; 10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, finding that an asymmetric underlying HI distribution is strongly preferred by our complete samples. We define the concepts of the average of the logarithmic HI mass, $\langle\log_{10}(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$, and the logarithmic average of the HI mass, $\log_{10}(\langle M_{\rm HI}\rangle)$, and find that the difference between $\langle\log_{10}(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$ and $\log_{10}(\langle M_{\rm HI}\rangle)$ can be as large as $\sim$0.5 dex for the preferred asymmetric HI distribution. We observe shallow slopes in the underlying $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ scaling relations, suggesting the presence of an upper HI mass limit beyond which a galaxy can no longer retain further HI gas. From our bivariate distribution we also infer the HI mass function at this redshift and find tentative evidence for a decrease of 2-10 times in the co-moving space density of the most HI massive galaxies up to $z\sim 0.5$.</description>

      <title>The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole accretion through an $\alpha$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius of the $\alpha$-accretion disc ($&lt;0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively, producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included, fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent: it survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA, and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift supermassive BHs observed by JWST.</description>

Abstract: A novel evolutionary method is introduced that can be used for constraining the parameters and theoretical models of Cosmology. The newly proposed algorithm, which is inherently parallel by design, is able to obtain the full potential of multi-core machines. With this algorithm, we could obtain the best-fit parameters of the $\Lambda CDM$ cosmological model as well as the uncertainties and identify the discrepancy in the Hubble parameter $H_0$. In the present work we discuss the design principle of this novel approach and also the results from the analysis of Pantheon, OHD and Planck datasets are reported here. The estimation of parameters shows significant consistency with the previously reported values as well as a higher computational performance measured in number iterations compared to the other similar exercises.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Equation of State to Cosmic Acceleration: Entropy Evolution and Phantom Crossing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamic evolution of the universe within the framework of a quadratic equation of state (EoS). Building upon the basis of the quadratic EoS model, as a phenomenological extension to dark energy models, we analyze the implications for cosmic dynamics, including energy density evolution of effective dark matter and dark energy, entropy behavior, and convexity stability conditions. Our approach emphasizes the significance of thermodynamic principles in understanding the late-time acceleration and the crossing of the phantom divide, providing a cohesive description consistent with recent observational data. Moreover, we demonstrate that the $\Lambda$CDM model, regardless of entropy additivity, violates the convexity condition, while the quadratic model aligns with maximum entropy and may prevent a \textit{Big Rip} scenario.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale structure surveys measure the shapes and positions of millions of galaxies in order to constrain the cosmological model with high precision. The resulting large data volume poses a challenge for the analysis of the data, from the estimation of photometric redshifts to the calibration of shape measurements. We present GalSBI, a model for the galaxy population, to address these challenges. This phenomenological model is constrained by observational data using simulation-based inference (SBI). The $\texttt{galsbi}$ Python package provides an easy interface to generate catalogs of galaxies based on the GalSBI model, including their photometric properties, and to simulate realistic images of these galaxies using the $\texttt{UFig}$ package.</description>

      <title>The impact of the redshift-dependent selection effect of halos on the redshift-space power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a wide-area spectroscopic survey of galaxies, it is nearly impossible to obtain a homogeneous sample of galaxies with respect to galaxy properties such as stellar mass and host halo mass across a range of redshifts. Despite the selection effect, theoretical templates in most analyses assume single tracers when compared with the measured clustering quantities. We demonstrate analytically that the selection effect inevitably introduces a bias in the redshift-space power spectrum on scales from linear to nonlinear scales. To quantitatively assess the impact of the selection effect, we construct mock galaxy catalogs from halos in N-body simulations by selecting halos above redshift-dependent mass thresholds such that the resulting redshift distribution of the halos, $n(z)$, matches that of SDSS-like galaxies. We find that the selection effect causes fractional changes of up to only 1% and 2% in the monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift-space power spectrum at $k\lesssim 0.3~h{\rm{Mpc}}^{-1}$, respectively, compared to the moments for the single mass-threshold (therefore single tracer) sample, for $n_{\rm g}(z)$ of the SDSS-like galaxy samples. We also argue that the selection effect is unlikely to cause a significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters using the Fisher matrix method, provided that the redshift-dependent selection effect is modest.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the HI 21-cm cosmology maps through Largest Cluster Statistics. Part II. Impact of the realistic foreground and instrumental noise on synthetic SKA1-Low observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Largest Cluster Statistics\,(LCS) analysis of the redshifted 21\,cm maps has been demonstrated to be an efficient and robust method for following the time evolution of the largest ionized regions\,(LIRs) during the Epoch of Reionization\,(EoR). The LCS can, in principle, constrain the reionization model and history by quantifying the morphology of neutral hydrogen\,(\HI) distribution during the different stages of the EoR. Specifically, the percolation transition of ionized regions, quantified and constrained via LCS, provides a crucial insight about the underlying reionization model. The previous LCS analysis of EoR 21\,cm maps demonstrates that the convolution of the synthesized beam of the radio interferometric arrays, e.g. SKA1-Low with the target signal, shifts the apparent percolation transition of ionized regions towards the lower redshifts. In this study, we present an optimal thresholding strategy to reduce this bias in the recovered percolation transition. We assess the robustness of LCS analysis of the 21\,cm maps, considering the effects of antenna-based gain calibration errors and instrumental noise for SKA1-Low. This analysis is performed using synthetic observations simulated by the \textsc{21cmE2E} pipeline, considering SKA1-Low AA4 configuration within a radius of 2\,km from the array centre. Our findings suggest that a minimum of $2000$\,hours of observation (SNR $\gtrapprox 3$) are required for the LCS analysis to credibly suppress the confusion introduced by thermal noise. Further, we also demonstrate that for a maximum antenna-based calibration error tolerance of $\sim 0.02\%$ (post calibration), the reionization history can be recovered in a robust and relatively unbiased manner using the LCS.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for interacting dark energy with time-dependent momentum exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of interacting dark energy and dark matter offer a possible solution to cosmological tensions. In this work, we examine a pure momentum-exchange model with a time-dependent coupling strength $\xi(z)$ that could help to alleviate the $S_8$ tension. We perform Fisher forecasting and MCMC analysis to constrain the coupling strength of this interaction for different redshift bins $0.0&lt;z&lt;2.1$, using the specifications of upcoming DESI-like surveys. For this analysis, we examine both a model with a constant equation of state $w=-0.9$, as well as a thawing dark energy model with an evolving $w(z)$. We show that, for a constant equation of state, $\xi(z)$ can be well constrained in all redshift bins. However, due to a weaker effect at early times, the constraints are significantly reduced at high redshifts in the case of a thawing $w(z)$ model.</description>

      <title>The Route to Unveil the Cosmic Genealogy of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), generated by unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), provides a unique probe of their population and its cosmic evolution. In this work, we explore the potential of uncovering the SMBHB population and its redshift dependence by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy distribution through cross-correlation analyses. Using a Fisher analysis technique, we show that the SGWB power spectrum alone can not provide any information on the evolutionary history of SMBHBs, whereas the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of the SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution substantially improves constraints on the redshift evolution parameters. Assuming pulsar timing array (PTA) configurations achievable in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era, we find that the combined use of isotropic and anisotropic SGWB signals, together with galaxy surveys, can provide valuable measurements of the redshift evolution of the SMBH-galaxy connection and the frequency distribution of SMBHBs. These results highlight the potential of joint GW-galaxy studies to address the long-standing open question of SMBH growth and evolution across cosmic time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Cosmic voids are vast underdense regions in the cosmic web that encode crucial information about structure formation, the composition of the Universe, and its expansion history. Due to their lower density, these regions are less affected by non-linear gravitational dynamics, making them suitable candidates for analysis using semi-analytic methods. Aims. We assess the accuracy of the PINOCCHIO code, a fast tool for generating dark matter halo catalogs based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, in modeling the statistical properties of cosmic voids. We validate this approach by comparing the resulting void statistics measured from PINOCCHIO to those obtained from N-body simulations. Methods. We generate a set of simulations using PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, assuming a fiducial cosmology and varying the resolution. For a given resolution, the simulations share the same initial conditions between the different simulation codes. Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics: void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results. We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\sigma} between PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends. This demonstrates that the PINOCCHIO code can reliably produce void statistics with high computational efficiency compared to full N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic or Systematic? Bayesian model selection between dark energy and supernova biases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DES-5Y supernovae, combined with DESI BAO, appear to favour Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $(w_0, w_a)$ dynamical dark energy over $\Lambda$CDM. arXiv:2408.07175 suggested that this is driven by a systematic in the DES pipeline, which particularly affects the low-redshift supernovae brought in from legacy surveys. It is difficult to investigate these data in isolation, however, as the complicated supernovae pipelines must properly account for selection effects. In this work, we discover that the Bayesian evidence previously found for flexknot dark energy (arXiv:2503.17342) is beaten by a magnitude offset between the low- and high-redshift supernovae. In addition, we find that the possible tension between DES-5Y and DESI is significantly reduced by such an offset. We also take the opportunity to trial Nested Bridge Sampling with Sequential Monte Carlo as an alternative method for calculating Bayes factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological models where dark matter interacts with dark energy via a pure momentum transfer and with no energy exchange (i.e. elastic) provide compelling scenarios for addressing the apparent lack of structures at low redshift. In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.</description>

      <title>Debiasing cosmological parameters from large-scale foreground contamination in Cosmic Microwave Background data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments aim to achieve high-precision reconstruction of the CMB polarization signal, with the most ambitious objective being the detection of primordial $B$ modes sourced by cosmic inflation. Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate-parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$-is highly susceptible to contamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component separation. In this work, we introduce a model-independent procedure to construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the observed angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of foreground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These maps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction, yielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after component separation. The power spectrum of this estimated residual map is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological likelihood. We validate the proposed method using realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment processed with two Internal Linear Combination (ILC) component-separation techniques, focusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. When the foreground contribution is not included in the model, the resulting $r$ posteriors are biased, irrespective of its input value, the assumed foreground model, or the adopted masking strategy. Conversely, when the residual template is included in the likelihood, the analysis yields unbiased estimates of $r$ for all considered cases, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the proposed procedure. The pipeline has been made publicly available as part of the BROOM Python package (https://github.com/alecarones/broom).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves (GWs) paves the beginning of a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. Black holes (BHs) in their ringdown phase provide the cleanest signal of emitted GWs that imprint the fundamental nature of BHs under low energy perturbation. Apart from GWs, any complementary signature of ringing BHs can be of paramount importance. Motivated by this we analyzed the scattering of electromagnetic waves in such a background and demonstrated that the absorption cross section of a ringing Schwarzschild BH can be superradiant. Moreover, we have found out that such superradiant phenomena are transient in nature with a characteristic time scale equal to the GW oscillation time scale. We further point out that the existing ground-based Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), radio telescopes, may be able to detect such transient signals from BHs of mass range $M\sim 10^{-1} - 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, which should necessarily be of primordial origin. Our present result opens up an intriguing possibility of observing the black hole merging phenomena through electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Light Compact Scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussianities generated by light axions, or compact scalar fields, during inflation. To correctly calculate their impact on primordial statistics, we will argue that it is necessary to account for the periodicity, or gauge symmetry, of the compact scalars. We illustrate this point by comparing the predictions for the squeezed kinematic limit of the primordial bispectrum generated by two cases: a non-compact scalar $\sigma$ and a compact scalar $\varphi$. We demonstrate that while a light non-compact scalar predicts a bispectrum of the so-called local shape, the light compact scalar predicts a qualitatively different shape characterised by the ratio of the Hubble scale to its field-space circumference. In doing so, we show that ignoring the gauge symmetry of the compact scalar during inflation leads to spurious infrared enhancements which are softened by working with appropriate gauge-invariant operators. In addition, we connect our results for the primordial bispectrum with late-time cosmological observables and show that it is possible to measure the decay constant of the compact scalar using galaxy clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between pair-created twin universes with opposite time arrows should leave a birthmark on CMB spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why (and how) the Universe was born is one of the ultimate questions in physics. Another big puzzle is about the arrow of time: why is there only one direction of time? Are these two issues related? One way to solve both puzzles at one stroke is to posit that our universe was pair-created with a twin, whose time arrow is opposite to ours. If so, then the twins must naturally be quantum entangled. In Euclidean quantum gravity, this implies the existence of a Euclidean wormhole bridging the twin universes. Each universe is then in a mixed-state and the mutual entanglement shall leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum. Invoking the Klebanov-Susskind-Banks wormhole as a toy model for the sake of tractability, we show that the entanglement selects a novel and unique global vacuum for the total inflaton perturbations in both universes. This is equivalent to imposing a simple harmonic oscillator boundary condition on the Euclidean wavefunction of the total perturbations, and it turns out that the entanglement enhances the CMB power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. Such a birthmark renders our notion refutable.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Coexistence of Freeze-in Dark Matter and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle dark matter and primordial black holes (PBH) might coexist with appreciable cosmic abundances, with both contributing to the observed dark matter density $\Omega_{\rm DM}$. Large populations of PBH (with $\Omega_{\rm PBH}\sim \Omega_{\rm DM}$) are tightly constrained for PBH heavier than $10^{-11} M_\odot$. However, large fractional abundances with $ f_{\rm PBH}\simeq \Omega_{\rm PBH}/\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim0.01$ are consistent with the limits on PBH for a wide range of PBH masses. Scenarios with significant populations of both particle dark matter and PBH are intriguing. Notably, if the particle dark matter has interactions with the Standard Model, new constraints arise due to pair-annihilations that are enhanced by the PBHs, resulting in dark matter indirect detection constraints on $f_{\rm PBH}$. Here we derive the bounds on mixed scenarios in which PBHs coexist with particle dark matter whose relic abundance is set via freeze-in (``FIMPs''). We show that while the restrictions on $f_{\rm PBH}$ are less constraining for FIMPs than WIMPs, modest bounds still arise for large classes of models. We examine both IR and UV freeze-in scenarios, including the case of ``superheavy'' particle dark matter with PeV scale mass.</description>

      <title>Can local White Dwarfs constrain Dark Matter interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether nearby white dwarfs (WDs) can constrain dark matter (DM) interactions with ordinary matter. As experimental sensitivity improves, driven by the Gaia mission, the sample volume of nearby WDs has been increasing over recent years. We carefully select a sample of ten cold, isolated, non-magnetic WDs within 13~pc of the Sun. We model their carbon-oxygen interior using a finite temperature relativistic equation of state and model atmospheres to infer their core temperatures. This enables us to perform a thorough estimation of the DM capture rate and evaporation mass using actual astrophysical observations. Given the low local DM density, we focus on DM that annihilates into long-lived mediators, which escape the WD and later decay into photons. While \textit{Fermi}-LAT data shows no significant gamma-ray excess, future telescopes, CTA North \&amp; South, LHAASO, SWGO, could probe DM-nucleon cross sections down to $\sim 10^{-41}~\text{cm}^2$ for DM masses above the TeV scale. Our results are competitive with current direct detection bounds (e.g., LZ) in the multi-TeV regime. This work underscores the importance of systematic WD studies in the broader landscape of DM detection and demonstrates the synergy between astrophysical and terrestrial searches in exploring DM interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Avoidance of Big Crunch Singularity in the Q-SC-CDM model via nonminimal coupling: Theory and Data Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models non-minimally coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and parameterized coupling $\xi$. We study the cosmological dynamics for a recently proposed descending dark energy model, namely, Q-SC-CDM. Initially, we choose distinct values of coupling parameter. For some values of $\xi$, the evolution of the universe is split up into three different phases: {\it decelerated expansion (early time), accelerated expansion (late-time) and slow-contraction (future era)}, and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future. In other scenario, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes, cosmic acceleration is obtained at current epoch, and the universe gets de-Sitter expansion at distant future. It is remarkable to see that the Big Crunch Singularity is redundant in the later case. Next, we investigate the phase space analysis for the model under consideration. Our investigation brings new asymptotic regimes and finds stable de-Sitter solution. Eventually, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI DR2) data. The results demonstrate that the present model yield constraints on key cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild tension with Pantheon+ measurements. Additionally, we employ the Om(z) diagnostic test, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM. The Statistical comparison reveals moderate support for the current model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smooth hybrid inflation is a hybrid inflation model which is free from topological defects and predicts the density perturbation with the spectral index of about $0.97$. We show that the prediction on the spectral index is robust regardless the power of nonrenormalizable terms and meets with the latest results reported by Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Viable scenarios for baryogenesis and dark matter are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive dynamical and phenomenological analysis of structure growth in curvature-modulated coupled quintessence scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa \rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa \phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable, non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by $\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast $\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus $\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable approach to interacting dark energy.</description>

      <title>Imprints of screened dark energy on nonlocal quantum correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <title>Ghost-free, gauge invariant SVT generalizations of Horndeski theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the generalizations of Kaluza--Klein compactifications of 5D Horndeski theory. They are Scalar--Vector--Tensor (SVT) theories with higher derivatives in the action, but with second order equations of motion. The vector field is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation and the Scalar--Tensor sector corresponds to Horndeski theory. A subclass of these SVT theories is such that the Horndeski functions $G_4(\pi,X)$ and $G_5(\pi)$ remain free, while the speed of the tensor and vector modes is exactly the same. We show a subclass where the vector sector retains freedom through new functions of $\pi,\, X$ while the speed of the vector modes still tracks the speed of the tensor modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear coupling between spacetime geometry and matter in the early Universe remains a frontier in theoretical cosmology. By introducing a novel gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamic framework, we reveal a fundamental analogy between magnetohydrodynamics and the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and relativistic plasma. We demonstrate that, in high-energy environments such as the electroweak phase transition, the (newly defined) gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, signifying a strongly coupled system where the gravitomagnetic field could be frozen into the fluid. This coupling inevitably leads to the emergence of gravitational Alfv\'en waves and could drive a transition to turbulence involving the dynamics of spacetime itself. Our findings suggest that gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamic turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.</description>

      <title>MEGATRON: the impact of non-equilibrium effects and local radiation fields on the circumgalactic medium at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present three cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic zoom simulations of the progenitor of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the MEGATRON suite. The simulations combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for example, HI damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases tenfold to $\approx 10^4\,M_\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.</description>

      <title>Axion Perturbations: A General Analytical Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological data provides us two key constraints on dark matter (DM): it must have a particular abundance, and it must have an adiabatic spectrum of density perturbations in the early universe. Many different cosmological scenarios have been proposed that establish the abundance of axion DM in qualitatively different ways. In this paper we emphasize that, despite this variety of backgrounds, the perturbations in axion DM can be understood from universal principles. How does a feebly interacting axion field acquire perturbations proportional to those of photons? How do the isocurvature power spectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the background evolution of the universe? We answer these questions for a completely general choice of cosmological background and temperature-dependent axion potential. We show that the most general solution to the axion field equation on super-horizon scales is entirely determined by the family of background solutions for different initial field values $\theta_{\rm ini}$. This holds for both the component in the field perturbation solution contributing to the DM isocurvature perturbation (enhanced at late times by the sensitivity of the DM abundance to the initial condition, $\partial \Omega_a / \partial \theta_{\rm ini}$, which can be large for initial conditions near the hilltop), and the other component that contributes to the DM curvature perturbation. In particular, we explain that an unperturbed axion field in the early universe evolving into one with nontrivial adiabatic perturbations is guaranteed by Weinberg's theorem on adiabatic modes. These results have been derived before with various assumptions, such as a radiation dominated background or a quadratic potential. Our aim is to give a clear, simple derivation that is manifestly independent of those assumptions, and thus can be applied to any cosmological axion scenario.</description>
