      <title>An inflationary cosmology from anti-de Sitter wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new type of wavefunction for the universe computed from the Euclidean path integral, with asymptotically $AdS$ boundary conditions. In the semiclassical limit, it describes a Euclidean (half)-wormhole geometry, exhibiting a local maximum of the scale factor at the surface of reflection symmetry, giving rise to an expanding universe upon analytic continuation to Lorentzian signature. We find that these Euclidean wormholes set natural initial conditions for inflation and that the semi-classical Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunction can favor a long lasting inflationary epoch, resolving a well known issue of the no-boundary proposal. Due to the asymptotic $AdS$ conditions in the Euclidean past they raise the possibility of describing the physics of inflating cosmologies and their perturbations within the context of holography.</description>

      <title>Towards Bootstrapping F-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider type IIB string theory with $N$ D3 branes and various configurations of sevenbranes, such that the string coupling $g_s$ is fixed to a constant finite value. These are the simplest realizations of F-theory, and are holographically dual to rank $N$ Argyres-Douglas conformal field theories (CFTs) with $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ flavor groups, and Minahan-Nemeschansky CFTs with $E_6, E_7$ and $E_8$ flavor groups. We use the Seiberg-Witten curves of these theories to compute the mass deformed sphere free energy $F(m)$ at large $N$ in terms of novel matrix models with non-polynomial potentials. We show how $F(m)$ can be used along with the analytic bootstrap to fix the large $N$ expansion of flavor multiplet correlators in these CFTs, which are dual to scattering of gluons on $AdS_5\times S^3$, and in the flat space limit determine the effective theory of sevenbranes in F-theory. As a first step in this program, we use the matrix models to compute the $\log N$ term in $F(m)$ and thereby fix the logarithmic threshold in the $AdS_5\times S^3$ holographic correlator, which matches the flat space prediction.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^p$ Amplitudes from the Positive Tropical Grassmannian: Triangulations of Extended Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global Schwinger formula, introduced by Cachazo and Early as a single integral over the positive tropical Grassmannian, provides a way to uncover properties of scattering amplitudes which are hard to see in their standard Feynman diagram formulation. In a recent work, Cachazo and one of the authors extended the global Schwinger formula to general $\phi^p$ theories. When $p=4$, it was conjectured that the integral decomposes as a sum over cones which are in bijection with non-crossing chord diagrams, and further that these can be obtained by finding the zeroes of a piece-wise linear function, $H(x)$. In this note we give a proof of this conjecture. We also present a purely combinatorial way of computing $\phi^p$ amplitudes by triangulating a trivial extended version of non-crossing $(p-2)$-chord diagrams, called extended diagrams, and present a proof of the bijection between triangulated extended diagrams and Feynman diagrams when $p=4$. This is reminiscent of recent constructions using Stokes polytopes and accordiohedra. However, the $\phi^p$ amplitude is now partitioned by a new collection of objects, each of which characterizes a polyhedral cone in the positive tropical Grassmannian in the form of an associahedron or of an intersection of two associahedra. Moreover, we comment on the bijection between extended diagrams and double-ordered biadjoint scalar amplitudes. We also conjecture the form of the general piece-wise linear function, $H^{\phi^p}(x)$, whose zeroes generate the regions in which the $\phi^p$ global Schwinger formula decomposes into.</description>

      <title>Four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order for a collinear configuration. Our results display a good agreement with the first lattice data for this vertex, released very recently (arXiv:2401.12008). A noteworthy novelty of our work is that we can provide analytical expressions for the four-gluon vertex in collinear configurations, together with a renormalization scheme that allows us to perform reliable perturbative computations even in the infrared regime. We observe an infrared suppression in the form factor associated with the tree-level four-gluon tensor with a possible zero-crossing in the deep infrared which demands new lattice investigations to be confirmed. Moreover, we report an infrared divergence in the completely symmetric tensor form factor due to the ghost-loop contributions. These results come as predictions since previous two-point correlations fix all the available parameters of the model, up to an overall constant factor.</description>

      <title>Kodaira-Spencer Anomalies with Stora-Zumino Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holomorphic diffeomorphism anomalies of $2\,n$ dimensional gravitational theories in Beltrami parametrisation (Kodaira-Spencer anomalies) are computed in the BRST framework, using an extension of the Stora-Zumino method. This method, which allows to compute anomalies in a very concise way, makes manifest the topological origin of anomalies. They have a clear geometric interpretation, since they are expressed in terms of Chern polynomials and Pontryagin invariants. The key ingredient is the formulation of the BRST transformations in terms of polyforms, whose total degree is the sum of the form degree and of the ghost number. This approach simplifies significantly the analysis available in literature and it allows to compute many other solutions. Namely, an anomaly, which was computed using different methods, is proved to be a consistent BRST anomaly, disproving a conclusion in a previous analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantisation of skyrmions using instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a step-by-step method to construct skyrmions from instanton ADHM data, including when the exact ADHM data is unknown. The configurations look like clusters of smaller skyrmions, and can be used to build manifolds of skyrmions with or without symmetries. Nuclei are described by quantum states on these manifolds. We describe the construction and quantisation procedure generally, then apply the methods in detail to the 8-skyrmion which describes the Beryllium-8 nucleus.</description>

      <title>Low spin solutions of Higher Spin Gravity: BPST instanton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher spin gravities do not have a low energy limit where higher-spin fields decouple from gravity. Nevertheless, it is possible to construct fine-tuned exact solutions that activate low-spin fields without sourcing the higher-spin fields. We show that BPST (Belavin-Polyakov-Schwartz-Tyupkin) instanton is an exact solution of Chiral Higher Spin Gravity, i.e. it is also a solution of the holographic dual of Chern-Simons matter theories. This gives an example of a low-spin solution. The instanton sources the opposite helicity spin-one field and a scalar field. We derive an Effective Field Theory that describes the coupling between an instanton and the other two fields, whose action starts with the Chalmers-Siegel action and has certain higher derivative couplings.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Edge Mode in $\mathcal{N}=1$ Jackiw-Teitelboim Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational edge mode in the $\mathcal{N}=1$ Jackiw-Teitelboim~(JT) supergravity on the disk and it $osp(2|1)$ BF formulation. We revisit the derivation of the finite-temperature Schwarzian action in the conformal gauge of the bosonic JT gravity through wiggling boundary and the frame fluctuation descriptions. Extending our method to $\mathcal{N}=1$ JT supergravity, we derive the finite-temperature super-Schwarzian action for the edge mode from both the wiggling boundary and the superframe field fluctuation. We emphasize the crucial role of the supersymmetric version of the inversion formula in elucidating the relation between the isometry and the $OSp(2|1)$ gauging of the super-Schwarzian action. In $osp(2|1)$ BF formulation, we discuss the asymptotic AdS condition. We employ the Iwasawa-like decomposition of $OSp(2|1)$ group element to derive the super-Schwarzian action at finite temperature. We demonstrate that the $OSp(2|1)$ gauging arises from inherent redundancy in the Iwasawa-like decomposition. We also discuss the path integral measure obtained from the Haar measure of $OSp(2|1)$.</description>

      <title>Cardy matches Bethe on the Surface: a Tale of a Brane and a Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the insertion of a Gukov-Witten surface defect in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM corresponding to a probe D3-brane in the holographic dual setup. The defect gives rise to a $4d$-$2d$ coupled system encoding the entropy of the dual perturbed black hole, which can be extracted from the corresponding Superconformal Index. Elaborating on previous studies, we refine the results using both a saddle-point and a Bethe-Ansatz approach. The consistency of our computation is corroborated by the complete agreement between the two results in the appropriate regime of fugacities. Eventually, the sub-leading structure, emerging from our analysis, provides a suggestive EFT interpretation for the addition of the defect to the $4d$ system, mirroring the behavior of the probe D3-brane in the gravity dual.</description>

      <title>Loop Quantum Gravity effects on electromagnetic properties of charged leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efforts in this contribution consist in reassessing a modified Dirac equation that incorporates a $\gamma^0 \gamma_5$-Lorentz-symmetry violating (LSV) term induced as a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effect. Originally, this equation has been applied and considered as a good scenario for describing a number of investigations on the flight time of cosmic photons and neutrinos, which suggests that the speed of light in vacuum, in connection with the geometry that describes a granular space-time, takes an energy-dependent form, e.g., $v(E) =1 \pm E/E_{\tiny{\textrm{LSV}}}$, with $E_{\tiny{\textrm{LSV}}} \approx 6,5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV for neutrinos. Once LQG provides a viable way to consistently understand this picture, we pursue an analysis of this effective Dirac equation to inspect some of its properties. These include: the derivation of the modified fermionic propagator, attainment of the Gordon decomposition of the vector current with minimal electromagnetic coupling to obtain information on the form factors, examination of the non-relativistic limit of the equation, evaluation of the spin- and velocity-dependent corrections to the Coulomb potential due to LQG effects, and the modified Hamiltonian in the low-relativistic regime. The study of the form factors may open up paths to set up bounds on the LQG parameters from the precision measurements of electromagnetic attributes of the charged leptons, such as their respective electric and magnetic dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Jones polynomials from matrix elements of tangles in a pseudounitary representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these notes we review the calculation of Jones polynomials using a matrix representation of the braid group and Temperley-Lieb algebra. The pseudounitary representation that we consider allows constructing ``states'' from the group/algebra matrices and compute the knot invariants as matrix elements, rather than traces. In comparison with a more standard way of computing the invariants through traces, the matrix element method is more interesting and complete from the point of view of applications. As a byproduct of the discussion we prove a general formula for pretzel knots.</description>

Abstract: Worldsheet string theory is solvable for a variety of backgrounds involving Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes, in terms of gauged nonlinear sigma models on group manifolds. We compute the worldsheet torus partition function of these models, and propose gauging of null isometries as a unifying principle and conceptual framework for this large family of string backgrounds. In the process, we explain how partition functions of asymmetrically gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models can be computed from the path integral, and organize and systematize various results scattered throughout the literature.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for the Giant Graviton four-point Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the four-point correlator $\langle \mathcal{O}_2 \mathcal{O}_2 \mathcal{D} \mathcal{D} \rangle$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM) with $SU(N)$ gauge group, where $\mathcal{O}_2$ represents the superconformal primary operator with dimension two, while $\mathcal{D}$ denotes a determinant operator of dimension $N$, which is holographically dual to a giant graviton D3-brane extending along $S^5$. We analyse the integrated correlator associated with this observable, obtained after integrating out the spacetime dependence over a supersymmetric invariant measure. Similarly to other classes of integrated correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, this integrated correlator can be computed through supersymmetric localisation on the four-sphere. Employing matrix-model recursive techniques, we demonstrate that the integrated correlator can be reformulated as an infinite sum of protected three-point functions with known coefficients. This insight allows us to circumvent the complexity associated with the dimension-$N$ determinant operator, significantly streamlining the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator. In the planar limit and beyond, we derive exact results for the integrated correlator valid for all values of the 't Hooft coupling, and investigate the resurgent properties of their strong coupling expansion. Additionally, in the large-$N$ expansion with fixed (complexified) Yang-Mills coupling, we deduce the $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ completion of these results in terms of the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. The proposed modular functions are confirmed by explicit instanton calculations from the matrix model, and agree with expectations from the holographic dual picture of known results in type IIB string theory.</description>

      <title>Axial Anomalies of Maximally Supersymmetric Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit anomalies of $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ maximally supersymmetric tensor theories in $d=6$. A $(4,0)$ on-shell tensor multiplet descends to that of the $d=5$ maximal supergravity upon a dimensional reduction, hypothesized to offer a strong-coupled UV completion of the latter in the same sense of $(2,0)$ theories as the UV completion of $d=5$ $N=2$ pure Yang-Mills. The gravitational anomalies, found to be nonvanishing, had been computed, although its relevance in the absence of the $d=6$ metric is not obvious. We perform a comprehensive anomaly computation for (4,0) and (3,1) tensor supermultiplets, respectively, for $Sp(4)$ and $Sp(3)\times Sp(1)$ $R$-symmetry anomalies and the mixed $R$-gravitational anomaly thereof, and find that anomalies involving $R$-symmetries cancel out identically. We close with questions on how to address the anomaly in this class of theories with no general covariance.</description>

Abstract: Recent investigations [arXiv:2111.02429][arXiv:2210.09647][arXiv:2304.05453] have introduced an infinite class of novel gravitational observables in Asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) space that reside on codimension-one or -zero regions of the bulk spacetime. These observables encompass well-established holographic complexity measures such as the maximum volume of the extremal hypersurfaces and the action or spacetime volume of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch. Furthermore, this family of observables exhibits two universal properties when applied to the thermofield double (TFD) state: they exhibit linear growth at late times and faithfully reproduce the switchback effect. This implies that any observable from this class has the potential to serve as a gravitational dual for the circuit complexity of boundary states.</description>

      <title>Double Holography of Entangled Universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ double holography to examine a system of two entangled gravitating universes that live on two codimension-one branes in an asymptotically AdS$_3$ spacetime with two disjoint conformal boundaries. There are distinct brane configurations depending on the temperature of the thermofield double (TFD) state between the left and right systems. The topology transition between two branes is naturally identified with the emergence of an Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting the two entangled universes. This doubly holographic construction offers a holographic perspective on gravitational collapse and black hole formation in brane universes. Through this holographic framework, we analyze the quantum information structure of the two gravitating universes. Specifically, we calculate the mutual information between defects present in the boundary theories on the left and right sides. Furthermore, we investigate the decoupling process in the Hayden-Preskill protocol applied to the two copies of the defect field theory and discuss the interpretation of the Yoshida-Kitaev decoding protocol.</description>

Abstract: Based on the observation that the dimension of the tangent space is not necessarily equal to the dimension of the corresponding curved manifold and on the known fact that gravitational theories can be formulated in a gauge theoretic way, we discuss how to describe all known interactions in a unified manner. This is achieved by enlarging the tangent group of the four-dimensional manifold to $SO(2,16)$, which permits the inclusion of both gauge groups, the one that describes gravity as a gauge theory as well as the $SO(10)$ describing the internal interactions. Moreover it permits the use of both Weyl and Majorana conditions imposed on the fermions, as to avoid the duplication of fermion multiplets of $SO(10)$ appearing in previous attempts. The gravity theory discussed in the present work is the Conformal Gravity which, after a spontaneous symmetry breaking, can lead either to Weyl Gravity or to the usual Einstein Gravity.</description>

      <title>Simplified functional flow equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

      <title>Massless fermions in black string spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the behaviour of massless fermions in the black string spacetime by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Weyl equations. These solutions allowed us to study the behaviour of such massless fermions in terms of the cosmological constant, the black string's mass and the radial distance of the particle from the black string. The solutions, written in terms of Parabolic Cylinder functions and Laguerre polynomials, were obtained for a particle far from the black string and around the horizon event. For the particle around the event horizon, for all configuration of parameters, the energy eigenvalues are complex-valued, indicating QNM similarly to the case of spherical black holes. For the particle far from the black string, the energies derived from the Weyl equation set up conditions on the parameters in order to keep the energy as a real valued parameter.</description>

      <title>Spectra of correlators in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>

      <title>Solution Generation of a Capped Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the electric Harrison transformation developed in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, we construct an exact solution characterizing non-BPS charged rotating black holes with a horizon cross-section of a lens space L(n;1). Among these solutions, only the ones corresponding to n=0 and n=1 do not have any curvature singularities, conical singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and orbifold singularities both on and outside the horizon; additionally, it is free from closed timelike curves. The solution for n=0 corresponds to the charged dipole black ring that we constructed in the previous paper. The specific solution for n=1, referred to as the ``capped black hole," was introduced in our previous letter. This provides the first example of a non-BPS exact solution, representing an asymptotically flat, stationary spherical black hole with a domain of outer communication (DOC) having a nontrivial topology in five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We demonstrate that the DOC on a timeslice has the topology of $[R^4\# CP^2 ]\setminus B^4$. Differing from the well-known Myers-Perry and Cveti\v{c}-Youm black holes describing a spherical horizon topology and a DOC with a trivial topology of $R^4 \setminus B^4$ on a timeslice, the capped black hole's horizon is capped by a disc-shaped bubble. We explicitly demonstrate that the capped black hole carries mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and a magnetic flux, with only three of these quantities being independent. Furthermore, we reveal that this black hole can possess identical conserved charges as the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole. The existence of this solution challenges black hole uniqueness beyond both the black ring and the BPS spherical black hole. Moreover, within specific parameter regions, the capped black hole can exhibit a larger entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in two different ways, Hurwitz numbers and quantum curves. The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.</description>

      <title>Wormhole solutions under the effect of dark matter in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the background of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, this work investigates three distinct dark matter halo profiles to test the possibility of generalised wormhole geometry within the galactic halo regions. The current study aims to accomplish these goals by examining various dark matter profiles including Universal Rotation Curves (URC), Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model-I, and NFW model-II inside two distinct $f(R, L_m)$ gravity models. According to the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + L_m^\alpha$ model, the DM halo density profiles produce suitable shape functions that meet all the necessary requirements for exhibiting the wormhole geometries with appropriate choice of free parameters. In addition, to examine DM profiles under the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$ model, we consider a specific shape function. Further, we observed that the derived solution from both two models violates the null energy constraints, confirming that the DM supports wormholes to maintain in the galactic halo.</description>

Abstract: Following the strategy outlined in [DP09] arXiv:math/0604617 and [DP22] arXiv:math/0604617 for bundles of rank 2 on a smooth projective curve of genus $2$, we construct flat connections over the moduli of stable bundles, with singularities along the wobbly locus. We verify that the associated $D$-modules are Hecke eigensheaves. The local systems are constructed by the nonabelian Hodge correspondence from Higgs bundles. The spectral varieties of the Higgs bundles are the Hitchin fibers corresponding to the Hecke eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Can CP be conserved in the two-Higgs-doublet model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conditions under which the CP violation in the quark mixing matrix can leak into the scalar potential of the real two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) via divergent radiative corrections, thereby spoiling the renormalizability of the model. We show that any contributing diagram must involve 12 Yukawa-coupling insertions and a factor of the $U(1)_{PQ}$-breaking scalar potential parameter $\lambda_5$, thereby requiring at least six loops; this also implies that the 2HDM with only softly-broken $U(1)_{PQ}$ is safe from divergent leaks of CP violation to all orders. We demonstrate that additional symmetries of the six-loop diagrams in the type I and II 2HDMs guarantee that all of the divergent CP-violating contributions cancel at this order. We also show that these symmetries are violated at seven loops and enumerate the classes of diagrams that can contribute to CP-violating divergences, providing evidence that the real 2HDM is theoretically inconsistent starting at the seven-loop level.</description>

      <title>Symplectic quantization and the Feynman propagator: a new real-time numerical approach to lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here the first numerical test of symplectic quantization, a new approach to quantum field theory. Symplectic quantization is characterized by the possibility to sample quantum fluctuations of relativistic fields by means of a deterministic dynamics generated by Hamilton-like equations, the latter evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$. In the present work we study numerically the symplectic quantization dynamics for a real scalar field in 1+1 space-time dimensions and with $\lambda \phi^4$ non-linear interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the Fourier spectrum of the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation over quantum fluctuations is computed as a dynamical average along the trajectories parametrized by the intrinsic time $\tau$. As a numerical strategy to study quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Lorentzian space-time, we believe that symplectic quantization will be of key importance for the study of non-equilibrium relaxational dynamics in quantum field theory and the phenomenology of metastable bound states with very short life-time, something usually not accessible by numerical methods based on Euclidean field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of electron-positron pair production from vacuum in the presence of a uniform time-dependent electric field of arbitrary polarization. Taking into account the interaction with the external classical background in a nonperturbative manner, we quantize the electron-positron field and derive a system of ten quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) showing that the previously-used QKEs are incorrect once the external field rotates in space. We employ then the Wigner-function formalism of the field quantization and establish a direct connection between the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) approach to investigating the vacuum pair-production process and the QKEs. We provide a self-contained description of the two theoretical frameworks rigorously proving their equivalence and present an exact one-to-one correspondence between the kinetic functions involved within the two techniques. Special focus is placed on the analysis of the spin effects in the final particle distributions.</description>

Abstract: We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with numerous examples.</description>

Abstract: Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late $80$-ties and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. In the present article we investigate the possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. The variational principle is formulated in $5$ dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations is then presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>The flavor structures on magnetized orbifold models and 4D modular symmetric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quark and lepton flavor structures on magnetized $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ twisted orbifold model. There are 6,460 number of flavor models but most of them cannot lead to realistic flavor observables because of the difficulties on realizing mass hierarchies and small (large) mixing angles of quarks (leptons). We find that certain zero point patterns of zero-modes of fermions and Higgs fields give the flavor models being able to avoid these difficulties. We classify such flavor models and show numerical example.
  Next we study four-dimensional (4D) modular symmetric quark flavor models without fine-tuning. Mass matrices become hierarchical as close to the modular symmetric points depending on its residual charges. Actually the residual $Z_N$ symmetries with $N\geq 6$ can originate the large quark mass hierarchies. Also the products of residual symmetries such as $Z_3\times Z_3\times Z_3$ have such possibility. We study the quark flavor model with $\Gamma_6$ symmetry and $A_4\times A_4\times A_4$ symmetry. We assume the vicinity of the cusp $\tau=i\infty$ where residual $Z_6$ and $Z_3\times Z_3\times Z_3$ symmetry remain. Consequently we find the models realizing the order of the quark mass ratios and the absolute values of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements without fine-tuning.
  Finally we construct the Siegel modular forms. Zero-modes on $T^6$ at $\vec{z}=0$ are the Siegel modular forms of weight 1/2 for the subgroup of $Sp(6,\mathbb{Z})$. They have several moduli parameters and therefore have the possibility realizing the flavor structures including the CP phases. We study the Siegel modular forms transformed by $\widetilde{\Delta}(96)$ and show numerical example. We find one of moduli parameters $\omega_1$ works on the large mass hierarchies and $\omega_2$ works on the CP violation successfully in our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the interaction Hamiltonian is $\widehat{H}_I = \kappa \left(\hat{x}_3 \hat{p}_1 + \hat{p}_3 \hat{p_2} \right)$ for large $\kappa$ and the initial quantum state is $\Psi_{in} (x_1, x_2, x_3) = \prod_{j=1}^3 \phi_j (x_j)$, the joint measurement of complementary variables $x_3$ and $p_3$ at $t = 1 / \kappa$ induces the uncertainty $\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} (t = 1 / \kappa) \Delta_{ \hat{x}_2} (t = 1 / \kappa) \geq \frac{1}{2} (\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} \Delta_{\hat{p}_1} + \Delta_{\hat{x}_2} \Delta_{\hat{p}_2} ) + \Delta_{\hat{x}_3} \Delta_{\hat{p}_3}$ , where the standard deviations in the right hand are the deviations at $t=0$. This is a generalized version of the well-known Arthurs-Keller inequality $\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} (t = 1 / \kappa) \Delta_{ \hat{x}_2} (t = 1 / \kappa) \geq 1$ arising when all $\phi_j (x_j)$ are the minimal uncertainty Gaussian states. If the initial probe state is entangled, it is shown that the generalized Arthurs-Kelly inequality can be violated. We show the violation explicitly by introducing a special example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study black hole (BH) solutions in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories which is classified in a subclass of the $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories. The scalar field is coupled to the vector field, which has electric and magnetic charges. For the static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate modifications to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions focusing on the three types of scalar-vector interactions, including derivative couplings. We solve the field equations analytically in two asymptotic regions which are the vicinity of the BH horizon and the spatial infinity, and clarify the condition for the existence of scalar hair. To understand the behaviors of solutions in intermediate scales, the field equations are integrated numerically for concrete models with different types of couplings. We find new hairy BH solutions with scalar hair in the presence of magnetic charge and kinetic coupling. The magnetic charge plays an important role in distinguishing hairy BH solutions originated from three types of different interactions at a large coupling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral amplitude of the merger-ringdown gravitational wave (GW) emitted by a comparable mass-ratio black hole merger is modeled by the greybody factor of the remnant black hole. Our model does not include fitting parameters except for a single overall spectral amplitude. We perform the mass-spin inference from the SXS data without introducing fitting parameters and without tuning the data range of each SXS template. Also, we find that the exponential damping in the ringdown spectral amplitude can be modeled well with the exponential damping in the greybody factor at high frequencies. Based on the findings, we propose a conjecture that the light ring of the remnant black hole, which sources the ringdown, forms as early as during the merger stage. We discuss the formation of the light ring in the static binary solution as a first step towards the understanding of how the separation of merging black holes may affect the formation of the light ring.</description>

      <title>A misleading naming convention: de Sitter `tachyonic' scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the so-called `tachyonic' scalar fields in de Sitter (dS) spacetime. Through a rigorous group-theoretical analysis, we argue that labeling these fields as `tachyonic' lacks physical relevance, frequently resulting in misinterpretations in scholarly discourse, such as the misconception of faster-than-light travel associated with the corresponding particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-consider recent measures of $R_{K}$ and $R_{K^*}$, now compatible with the Standard Model expectations, as well as the results for the process $\text{BR}(B_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)$ alongside earlier determinations of $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ and $\text{BR}(B_c \rightarrow \tau \nu)$. We provide analytic constraints on the associated Wilson coefficients in both the $b \to s$ and the $b \to c$ sectors. These allow us to estimate the scale of potential New Physics for generic extensions of the Standard Model. We then use the results to constrain the leptoquark landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the new physics phenomena of gravidynamics governed by the inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry based on the gravitational quantum field theory. Such a gravidynamics enables us to derive the generalized Einstein equation and an equation beyond it. To simplify the analyses, we linearize the dynamic equations of gravitational interaction by keeping terms up to the leading order in the dual gravigauge field. We then apply the linearized dynamic equations into two particular gravitational phenomena. First, we consider the linearized equations in the absence of source fields, which is shown to have five physical propagating polarizations as gravitational waves, i.e., two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar, instead of two tensor polarizations in the general relativity. Second, we examine the Newtonian limit in which the gravitational fields and the matter source distribution are weak and static. By deriving the associated Poisson equation, we obtain the exact relation of the fundamental interaction coupling in the gravidynamics with the experimentally measured Newtonian constant. We also make use of nonrelativistic objects and relativistic photons to probe the Newtonian field configurations. In particular, the experiments from the gravitational deflection of light rays and the Shapiro time delay can place stringent constraints on the linearized gravidynamics in the gravitational quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Massive Compact Star Admitting Conformal Motion Under Bardeen Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article primarily investigates the existence of the charged compact star under the conformal motion treatment within the context of f(Q) gravity. We have developed two models by implementing the power-law and linear form of conformal factor, enabling an in-depth comparison in our study. We have selected the MIT Bag model equation of state to describe the connection between pressure and energy density and matched the interior spherically symmetric space-time with the Bardeen space-time. In addition, the present research examines various physically valid characteristics of realistic stars, such as PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and SMC X-1. We compare two constructed models by attributing the behavior of density, pressure, equilibrium conditions, and the adiabatic index. We have additionally included a brief analysis of the scenario involving Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime as an external geometry for the matching condition. In contrast to the Reissner-Nordstrom instance, the Bardeen model with the extra term in the asymptotic representations yields a more intriguing and viable result. The current analysis reveals that the resulting compact star solutions are physically acceptable and authentic when considering the presence of charge with conformal motion in f(Q) gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11360v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $SU(\infty)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory at the dimensions $D=2,3,4$ via the numerical bootstrap method. It combines the Makeenko-Migdal loop equations, with a cut-off $L_{\mathrm{max}}$ on the maximal length of loops, and positivity conditions on certain matrices of Wilson loops. Our algorithm is inspired by the pioneering paper of P.Anderson and M.Kruczenski but it is significantly more efficient, as it takes into account the symmetries of the lattice theory and uses the relaxation procedure in line with our previous work on matrix bootstrap. We thus obtain rigorous upper and lower bounds on the plaquette average at various couplings and dimensions. For $D=4$, the lower bound data appear to be close to the MC data in the strong coupling phase and the upper bound data in the weak coupling phase reproduce well the 3-loop perturbation theory. Our results suggest that this bootstrap approach can provide a tangible alternative to the, so far uncontested, Monte Carlo approach.</description>

Abstract: Some time ago, the standard geometric framework of Einstein gravity was extended by gauging the Maxwell algebra as well as the so called AdS-Maxwell algebra. In this letter it is shown that the actions for these four-dimensional extended Einstein gravities can be obtained from the five-dimensional Chern-Simons gravities actions by using the Randall-Sundrum compactification procedure. It is found that the In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction procedure, in the Weimar-Woods sense, can be used both to obtain the Maxwell-Chern-Simons action from the AdS-Maxwell-Chern-Simons action and to obtain the Maxwell extension of Einstein gravity in 4D from the four-dimensional extended AdS-Maxwell-Einstein-Hilbert action. It is also shown that the extended four-dimensional gravities belongs to the Horndeski family of scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a dilaton gravity model, we revisit the calculation of the temperature of an evaporating black hole that is initially formed by a shock wave, taking into account the quantum backreaction. Based on the holographic principle, along with the assumption of a boundary equation of motion, we show that the black hole energy is maintained for a while during the early stage of evaporation. Gradually, it decreases as time goes on and eventually vanishes. Thus, the Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the black hole temperature, defined by the emission rate of the black hole energy, starts from zero temperature and reaches a maximum value at a critical time, and finally vanishes. It is also shown that the maximum temperature of the evaporating black hole never exceeds the Hawking temperature of the eternal AdS$_{2}$ black hole. We discuss physical implications of the initial zero temperature of the evaporating black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the necessary conditions for 1-form symmetries to emerge in the long-distance limit when they are explicitly broken at short distances. A minimal requirement is that there exist operators which become topological at long distances and that these operators have non-trivial correlation functions. These criteria are obeyed when the would-be emergent symmetry is spontaneously broken, or is involved in 't Hooft anomalies. On the other hand, confinement, i.e. a phase with unbroken 1-form symmetry, is nearly incompatible with the emergence of 1-form symmetries. We comment on some implications of our results for QCD as well as the idea of Higgs-confinement continuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String on $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ backgrounds are known to be classically integrable in the presence of a mixture of Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz fluxes. It is expected that this results in the existence of a well-defined factorised worldsheet S matrix. In order to use integrability to compute the string spectrum we need such a factorised S matrix to exist also for the "mirror" model, obtained by a double Wick rotation of the original worldsheet theory. In the mixed-flux case the mirror model has a complex Hamiltonian, which raises questions on its well-definedness. In the paper we study the worldsheet tree-level S matrix of the original and mirror model and discuss some necessary conditions for the integrability and reality of the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the motion of the massless scalar field and nearly bound null geodesics in the near-ring region of a black hole, which may possess either acceleration or a gravitomagnetic mass. Around such black holes, the photon ring deviates from the equatorial plane. In the large angular momentum limit, we demonstrate that the massless scalar field exhibits an emergent conformal symmetry in this near-ring region. Additionally, in the nearly bound limit, we observe the emergence of a conformal symmetry for the null geodesics that constitute the photon ring in the black hole image. These findings suggest that the hidden conformal symmetry, associated with the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{s l}(2, \mathbb{R})$, persists even for black holes lacking north-south reflection symmetry, thereby broadening the foundation of photon ring holography. Finally, we show that the conformal symmetry also emerges for nearly bound timelike geodesics and scalar fields in proximity to the particle ring, and with specific mass around a Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

Abstract: We generalize recent methods regarding the construction of complete prepotentials of five dimensional SCFTs to two classes of rank-$N$ theories, i.e. the $X_{1,N}$ and the UV fixed point of the $SU(N+1)_0+2(N+1)$F gauge theories. Their complete prepotentials are consistently constructed starting from their weakly coupled description. The results are verified by employing UV dualities and decoupling of flavors from theories with known complete prepotentials. Applications of these results to the recent investigation of non-supersymmetric conformal field theories from soft supersymmetric breaking deformations are addressed.</description>

Abstract: We study the algebraic structures which govern the deformation of supersymmetric intersections of M2 and M5 branes. The universal algebras on M2 and M5 branes are deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra respectively. We give a new presentation of the deformed double current algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$, and we give a rigorous mathematical construction of the $\mathfrak{gl}_K$-extended $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$-algebra. A new presentation of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_K$ is also obtained. We construct various coproducts of these algebras, which are expected to encode the fusions of defects in twisted M-theory. The matrix extended Miura operators are identified as intertwiners in certain bimodules of these algebras.</description>

Abstract: We study the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) in the IP matrix model. It was shown in arXiv:1602.06422 that OTOCs do not grow when the adjoint is massless. We generalize the analysis of OTOCs to general nonzero masses $m &gt; 0$ for the adjoint, where we give a new prescription for analytic continuation in time such that we can evaluate OTOCs numerically using the retarded Green function. Despite the fact that the behaviors of the two-point functions, spectral density, and the Krylov complexity change drastically depending on whether the adjoint is massless or not, in the parameter ranges we study, we do not see the exponential growth of OTOCs for the massive adjoint cases. We end with a discussion of the comparison of this model with the SYK model and possible modification of the model.</description>

      <title>On the Backreaction of Dirac Matter in JT Gravity and SYK Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model backreaction in AdS$_2$ JT gravity via a proposed boundary dual Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev quantum dot coupled to Dirac fermion matter and study it from the perspective of quantum entanglement and chaos. The boundary effective action accounts for the backreaction through a linear coupling of the Dirac fermions to the Gaussian-random two-body Majorana interaction term in the low-energy limit. We calculate the time evolution of the entanglement entropy between graviton and Dirac fermion fields for a separable initial state and find that it initially increases and then saturates to a finite value. Moreover, in the limit of a large number of fermions, we find a maximally entangled state between the Majorana and Dirac fields in the saturation region, implying a transition of the von Neumann algebra of observables from type I to type II. This transition in turn indicates a loss of information in the holographically dual emergent spacetime. We corroborate these observations with a detailed numerical computation of the averaged nearest-neighbor gap ratio of the boundary spectrum and provide a useful complement to quantum entanglement studies of holography.</description>

Abstract: We present a map between the excitation of the symmetric-product orbifold CFT of $T^4$, and of the worldsheet-integrability description of $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ of Lloyd, Ohlsson Sax, Sfondrini, and Stefa\'nski at $k=1$. We discuss the map in the absence of RR fluxes, when the theory is free, and at small RR flux, $h\ll 1$, where the symmetric-orbifold CFT is deformed by a marginal operator from the twist-two sector. We discuss the recent results of Gaberdiel, Gopakumar, and Nairz, who computed from the perturbed symmetric-product orbifold the central extension to the symmetry algebra of the theory and its coproduct. We show that it coincides with the $h\ll 1$ expansion of the lightcone symmetry algebra known from worldsheet integrability, and that hence the S matrix found by Gaberdiel, Gopakumar, and Nairz maps to the one bootstrapped by the worldsheet integrability approach.</description>

      <title>3d $N=2$ theories from M-theory on CY4 and IIB brane box</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 3D $N=2$ supersymmetric field theories geometrically engineered from M-theory on non-compact Calabi-Yau fourfolds (CY4). We establish a detailed dictionary between the geometry and topology of non-compact CY4 and the physics of 3D $N=2$ theories in three different regimes. The first one is the Coulomb branch description when the CY4 is smooth. The second one is non-abelian gauge theory when the CY4 has a degenerate $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration structure. The third one is the strongly coupled SCFT from a CY4 singularity. We find interesting flavor symmetry enhancements in the singular limit of CY4, as well as an interesting and previously unexplored phenomenon in 3D, termed ``flavor symmetry duality''. Many examples are analyzed with an emphasis on toric CY4s and $\mathbb{C}^4$ orbifolds with crepant resolutions. We develop a new brane box method to study the physics of Coulomb branch of 3D $N=2$ theory that admits a toric construction. Via IIB/M-theory duality we find that the brane box diagram living in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be physically realized as a configuration of intersecting 4-branes which are extended objects in 8D maximal supersymmetric theory, which is shown to be consistent via various chains of dualities. The rank, effective gauge coupling and certain hints to flavor symmetry enhancement of the 3D $N=2$ theory are read off from the brane box and cross-checked against the results obtained from geometric engineering. The exotic branes in 8D maximal supersymmetric theory and the 4-string junctions thereof are shown to play a crucial role in the construction of the brane box.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the entanglement entropy of a subregion of the vacuum state in scalar quantum electrodynamics, working perturbatively to the 2-loops level. Doing so leads us to derive the Maxwell-Proca propagator in conical Euclidean space. The area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed. We indeed show that the vacuum of a subregion of spacetime purifies with energy in scalar quantum electrodynamics, which is related to the concept of screening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal eigenvalue distribution characterizing the Gram matrix of semiclassical ensembles of black hole microstates is recognized as the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, which plays a prominent role as the universal limit distribution in a large class of random matrix and vector models. It is proposed that this distribution also universally determines the energy spectral density of black holes, which allows to construct a Krylov space for the time evolution of typical black hole states and calculate their state complexity. It is checked that the state complexity growth at late times saturates Lloyd's bound. Some implications of the proposed spectral density for the generation of Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bjorken and threshold limit of a space-like structure function in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate a simple coordinate space structure function ${\cal E}(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to the next-to-leading order in the large $N$ expansion. We analytically perform the twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin representations. Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions are naturally generated in their Borel representations with detailed enumerations and explicit expressions provided to all powers. The renormalon cancellation at $t=n$ between the hard functions at powers $p$ and the non-perturbative functions at powers $p+n$ are explicitly verified, and the issue of "scale-dependency" of the perturbative and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. Simple expressions for the leading power non-perturbative functions are also provided both in the coordinate space and the momentum-fraction space ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) with "zero-mode-type" subtractions at $\alpha=0$ discussed in detail. In addition to the Bjorken limit, we also perform the threshold expansion of the structure function up to the next-to-next-to-leading threshold power exactly and investigate its relation to the twist expansion. In the appendix, we prove that the twist expansion is absolutely convergent for any $0&lt;z^2&lt;\infty$ and any $ \lambda \in iR_{\ge 0}$.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the 5PM order contributions to the scattering angle and impulse of classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on high-performance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal - cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. On the other hand, in static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state exhibits KMS condition of infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the algebra formed by operators that are gravitationally dressed to the static patch observer. In the current work we study the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in double-scaled SYK model. We show that the algebra exhibits a behavior reminiscent of both perspectives. In particular, we prove that it's a Type II$_1$ factor, and the empty state with no chords satisfies the tracial property, thus aligning with the expectation in previous work. Furthermore, we show it's a cyclic separating state by exploring the modular structure of the algebra. We then study various limits of the theory and explore corresponding relations to JT gravity, theory of baby universe, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present a full solution to the energy spectrum of $0$- and $1$- particle irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>Usefulness of signed eigenvalue/vector distributions of random tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum field theories can be applied to compute various statistical properties of random tensors. In particular signed distributions of tensor eigenvalues/vectors are the easiest, which can be computed as partition functions of four-fermi theories. Though signed distributions are different from genuine ones because of extra signs of weights, they are expected to coincide in vicinities of ends of distributions. In this paper, we perform a case study of the signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of the real symmetric order-three random tensor. The correct critical point and the correct end in the large $N$ limit are obtained from the four-fermi theory, for which a method using the Schwinger-Dyson equation is very efficient. Since locations of ends are particularly important in applications, such as the largest eigenvalues and the best rank-one tensor approximations, signed distributions are the easiest and highly useful through the Schwinger-Dyson method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture a structure formula for the $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten partition function for surfaces with holomorphic 2-form. The conjecture is based on $S$-duality and a structure formula for the vertical contribution previously derived by the third-named author using Gholampour-Thomas's theory of virtual degeneracy loci.
  For ranks $r=2,3$, conjectural expressions for the partition function in terms of the theta functions of $A_{r-1}, A_{r-1}^{\vee}$ and Seiberg-Witten invariants were known. We conjecture new expressions for $r=4,5$ in terms of the theta functions of $A_{r-1}, A_{r-1}^{\vee}$, Seiberg-Witten invariants, and continued fractions studied by Ramanujan. The vertical part of our conjectures is proved for low virtual dimensions by calculations on nested Hilbert schemes.
  The horizontal part of our conjectures gives predictions for virtual Euler characteristics of Gieseker-Maruyama moduli spaces of stable sheaves. In this case, our formulae are sums of universal functions with coefficients in Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. The universal functions, corresponding to different quantum vacua, are permuted under the action of the Galois group.
  For $r=6, 7$ we also find relations with Hauptmoduln of $\Gamma_0(r)$. We present $K$-theoretic refinements for $r=2,3,4$ involving weak Jacobi forms.</description>

      <title>Classification of Self-Dual Vertex Operator Superalgebras of Central Charge at Most 24</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the self-dual (or holomorphic) vertex operator superalgebras of central charge 24, or in physics parlance the purely left-moving, fermionic 2-dimensional conformal field theories with just one primary field.
  There are exactly 969 such vertex operator superalgebras under suitable regularity assumptions (essentially strong rationality) and the assumption that the shorter moonshine module $V\!B^\natural$ is the unique self-dual vertex operator superalgebra of central charge 23.5 whose weight-1/2 and weight-1 spaces vanish. Additionally, there might be self-dual vertex operator superalgebras arising as fake copies of $V\!B^\natural$ tensored with a free fermion $F$.
  We construct and classify the self-dual vertex operator superalgebras by determining the 2-neighbourhood graph of the self-dual vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 and also by realising them as simple-current extensions of a dual pair containing a certain maximal lattice vertex operator algebra. We show that all vertex operator superalgebras besides $V\!B^\natural\otimes F$ and potential fake copies thereof stem from elements of the Conway group $\mathrm{Co}_0$, the automorphism group of the Leech lattice $\Lambda$.
  By splitting off free fermions $F$, if possible, we obtain the classification for all central charges less than or equal to 24.</description>

Abstract: Considering an anisotropic cosmological background is an interesting and simultaneously challenging problem of theoretical physics, since we not only assume a high degree of anisotropy in the early stages of the Universe, but also observe it to a small degree until now. In this paper we have constructed the unconstrained action for the perturbations above Bianchi I type background in the most general scalar-tensor theory of gravity, the Horndeski theory, and evaluate the effect of the deviation from the anisotropic background on the previously established stable solution obtained in previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called ``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient for quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05151v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system forced to move on a submanifold $G_\alpha(q^A)=0$. If for some reasons we are interested in knowing the dynamics of all original variables $q^A(t)$, the most economical would be a Hamiltonian formulation on the intermediate phase-space submanifold spanned by reducible variables $q^A$ and an irreducible set of momenta $p_i$, $[i]=[A]-[\alpha]$. We describe and compare two different possibilities for establishing the Poisson structure and Hamiltonian dynamics on an intermediate submanifold: Hamiltonian reduction of the Dirac bracket and intermediate formalism. As an example of the application of intermediate formalism, we deduce on this basis the Euler-Poisson equations of a spinning body, establish the underlying Poisson structure, and write their general solution in terms of the exponential of the Hamiltonian vector field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the negativity of the moment of inertia of (quark-)gluon plasma in a window of "supervortical" range of temperatures above the deconfining phase transition, $T \simeq (1\dots 1.5) T_c $ found recently in numerical Monte Carlo simulations by two independent methods. In our work, we confirm numerically that the origin of this effect is rooted in the thermal evaporation of the non-perturbative chromomagnetic condensate. We argue that the negative moment of inertia of gluon plasma indicates the presence of a novel effect, the negative spin-vortical coupling for gluons resulting in a negative gluonic Barnett effect: the spin polarization of gluons exceeds the total angular momentum of rotating plasma thus forcing the orbital angular momentum to take negative values in the supervortical range of temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Explaining the behavior of macroscopic objects from the point of view of the quantum paradigm has challenged the scientific community for a century today. A mechanism of gravitational self-interaction, governed by the so-called Schroedinger-Newton equation, is among the proposals that aim to shed some light on it. Despite all efforts, this mechanism has been proven difficult to probe. Here, we consider a simple Stern-Gerlach-like experiment to try it out. The Schroedinger-Newton equation can be analytically solved under certain proper conditions, and a dephasing effect induced by the gravitational self-interacting potential can be calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Focusing on free-fermion quantum models known for their simplicity and effectiveness in studying highly entangled quantum systems, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic divergence in the entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of a self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Building upon the insights gained from the entanglement fractal, we explicitly elucidate the origin of the logarithmic divergence on fractals where translation symmetry is broken and the Widom conjecture is inapplicable. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>New mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma: first-principle results from rotating SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principle numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in rigidly rotating $N_c = 3$ gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously possesses both confining and deconfining phases in thermal equilibrium. Unexpectedly, the local critical temperature of the phase transition at the rotation axis does not depend on the angular frequency within a few percent accuracy. Even more surprisingly, an analytic continuation of our results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates a profound breaking of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in the vicinity of the phase transition, with the confining (deconfining) phase appearing far (near) the rotation axis.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial 2d higher topological quantum field theory from a local cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct combinatorial analogs of 2d higher topological quantum field theories. We consider triangulations as vertices of a certain CW complex $\Xi$. In the "flip theory," cells of $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ correspond to polygonal decompositions obtained by erasing the edges in a triangulation. These theories assign to a cobordism $\Sigma$ a cochain $Z$ on $\Xi_\mathrm{flip}$ constructed as a contraction of structure tensors of a cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra $V$ assigned to polygons. The cyclic $A_\infty$ equations imply the closedness equation $(\delta+Q)Z=0$. In this context we define combinatorial BV operators and give examples with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the "secondary polytope theory," $\Xi_\mathrm{sp}$ is the secondary polytope (due to Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky) and the cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra has to be replaced by an appropriate refinement that we call an $\widehat{A}_\infty$ algebra. We conjecture the existence of a good Pachner CW complex $\Xi$ for any cobordism, whose local combinatorics is descibed by secondary polytopes and the homotopy type is that of Zwiebach's moduli space of complex structures. Depending on this conjecture, one has an "ideal model" of combinatorial 2d HTQFT determined by a local $\widehat{A}_\infty$ algebra.</description>

      <title>Infinite quantum twisting at the Cauchy horizon of rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical calculation of the expectation value of the quantum angular-momentum current flux density for a scalar field in the Unruh state near the inner horizon of a Kerr-de Sitter black hole. Our results indicate that this flux diverges as $V_-^{-1}$ in a suitable Kruskal coordinate such that $V_-=0$ at the inner horizon. Depending on the parameter values of the scalar field and black hole that we consider, and depending on the polar angle (latitude), this flux can have different signs. In the near extremal cases considered, the angle average of the expectation value of the quantum angular momentum current flux is of the opposite sign as the angular momentum of the background itself, suggesting that, in the cases considered, quantum effects tend to decrease the total angular momentum of the spheres away from the extremal value. We also numerically calculate the energy flux component, which provides the leading order divergence of the quantum stress energy tensor, dominant over the classical stress energy tensor, at the inner horizon. Taking our expectation value of the quantum stress tensor as the source in the semiclassical Einstein equation, our analysis suggests that the spheres approaching the inner horizon can undergo an infinite twisting due to quantum effects along latitudes separating regions of infinite expansion and contraction.</description>

      <title>QED Effects on Kerr-Newman Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>
