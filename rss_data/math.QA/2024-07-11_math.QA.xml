      <title>Simple solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation of cardinality $p^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every prime number p and integer $n&gt;1$, a simple, involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solution $(X,r$) of the Yang-Baxter equation of cardinality $|X| = p^n$ is constructed. Furthermore, for every non-(square-free) positive integer m which is not the square of a prime number, a non-simple, indecomposable, irretractable, involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solution $(X,r)$ of the Yang-Baxter equation of cardinality $|X| = m$ is constructed. A recent question of Castelli on the existence of singular solutions of certain type is also answered affirmatively.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries in finite group gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the invertible and non-invertible symmetries of topological finite group gauge theories in general spacetime dimensions, where the gauge group can be Abelian or non-Abelian. We focus in particular on the 0-form symmetry. The gapped domain walls that generate these symmetries are specified by boundary conditions for the gauge fields on either side of the wall. We investigate the fusion rules of these symmetries and their action on other topological defects including the Wilson lines, magnetic fluxes, and gapped boundaries. We illustrate these constructions with various novel examples, including non-invertible electric-magnetic duality symmetry in 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and non-invertible analogs of electric-magnetic duality symmetry in non-Abelian finite group gauge theories. In particular, we discover topological domain walls that obey Fibonacci fusion rules in 2+1d gauge theory with dihedral gauge group of order 8. We also generalize the Cheshire string defect to analogous defects of general codimensions and gauge groups and show that they form a closed fusion algebra.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundaries of Representations and Coideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$, a (left) coideal is a (left) $\mathbb{G}$-invariant von Neumann subalgebra of $L^\infty(\mathbb{G})$. We introduce and analyze various generalizations of amenability and coamenability to coideals of discrete and compact quantum groups. We focus on a particular class of coideals found in the category of compact quantum groups, which are associated with a compact quasi-subgroup. This class includes all coideals of the quotient type. We also introduce the notion of a Furstenberg-Hamana boundary for representations of discrete quantum groups and use it to study amenability and coamenability properties of coideals. We then prove that a coideal of a compact quantum group that is associated with a compact quasi-subgroup is coamenable if and only if its codual coideal is $\mathbb{G}$-injective. If $\mathbb{G}$ is a unimodular or an exact discrete quantum group, we can replace $\mathbb{G}$-injectivity in the latter statement with the weaker condition of relative amenability. This result leads to a complete characterization of the unique trace property. Specifically, a unimodular discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ has the unique trace property if and only if the action of $\mathbb{G}$ on its noncommutative Furstenberg boundary is faithful. We also demonstrated that if a unimodular discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ is $C^*$-simple then it has the unique trace property. These findings are the quantum analogs of the groundbreaking results of Breuillard, Kalantar, Kennedy, and Ozawa and they provide answers to questions posted by Kalantar, Kasprzak, Skalski, and Vergnioux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Willerton's graphical calculus for bimonads to comodule monads, a monadic interpretation of module categories over a monoidal category. As an application, we prove a version of Tannaka--Krein duality for these structures.</description>

      <title>Multiplication formula for Hernandez and Leclerc's quivers with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multiplication formula of $F$-polynomial of representations of Hernandez and Leclerc's quivers with potentials. Since the truncated $q$-characters of some real simple modules over a quantum affine group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ can be expressed in terms of such $F$-polynomials, one can describe the product of two simple modules over $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ using this multiplication formula.</description>

      <title>A uniform trigonometric R-matrix for the exceptional series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a uniform trigonometric $R$-matrix for the adjoint representations on the exceptional series. The exceptional series is a finite list of points on a projective line with a simple Lie algebra attached to each point. This list of Lie algebras includes the five exceptional Lie algebras. For $L$ a simple Lie algebra there is a rational $R$-matrix in $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^2(L\oplus I))$ which has a quantum deformation to a trigonometric $R$-matrix. We construct a sixteen dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit{2})$, which interpolates the quantum deformations of the algebras $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^2(L\oplus I))$ and a 287 dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit{3})$, which interpolates the quantum deformations of the algebras $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^3(L\oplus I))$. Then we construct an $R$-matrix in $A^\square(\mathit{2})$ which satisfies the Yang--Baxter equation in $A^\square(\mathit{3})$ and which interpolates the trigonometric $R$-matrices for the points in the exceptional series.</description>

      <title>Normal forms for ordinary differential operators, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the generalised Schur theory offered in the recent paper by the second author in dimension one case, and apply it to obtain two applications in different directions of algebra/algebraic geometry.
  The first application is a new explicit parametrisation of torsion free rank one sheaves on projective irreducible curves with vanishing cohomology groups.
  The second application is a commutativity criterion for operators in the Weyl algebra or, more generally, in the ring of ordinary differential operators, which we prove in the case when operators have a normal form with the restriction top line (for details see Introduction).
  Both applications are obtained with the help of normal forms. Namely, considering the ring of ordinary differential operators $D_1=K[[x]][\partial ]$ as a subring of a certain complete non-commutative ring $\hat{D}_1^{sym}$, the normal forms of differential operators mentioned here are obtained after conjugation by some invertible operator ("Schur operator"), calculated using one of the operators in a ring. Normal forms of commuting operators are polynomials with constant coefficients in the differentiation, integration and shift operators, which have a restricted finite order in each variable, and can be effectively calculated for any given commuting operators.</description>
