      <title>Classification of Certain Rational Isoparametric Functions on Damek-Ricci Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify isoparametric functions on Damek-Ricci spaces which can be written in terms of the standard coordinates $(v,z,t)$ on the half-space model as a polynomial function divided by $t$. Regular level sets of the functions in our classification encompass almost all previously known examples of isoparametric hypersufaces in Damek-Ricci space and also yield new ones. For the new examples, the focal varieties are determined and the mean curvatures of the regular level sets is expressed as a function of the distance from the focal variety. We also study the exceptional case of tubes about $\mathbb R\mathbf H^k$ in $\mathbb C\mathbf H^k$, which are isoparametric, but cannot be obtained as the level sets of any function in our classification. We show that these tubes are level sets of a polynomial function divided by $t^2$, and that analogous functions on Damek-Ricci spaces can be isoparametric only in the case of $\mathbb C\mathbf H^k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature and a nonempty boundary $\partial M$. Fraser and Li \cite{Fraser&amp;Li} established a compactness theorem for the space of compact, properly embedded minimal surfaces of fixed topological type in $M$ with a free boundary on $\partial M$, assuming that $\partial M$ is strictly convex with respect to the inward unit normal. In this paper, we show that the strict convexity condition on $\partial M$ cannot be relaxed.</description>

      <title>Spray-Invariant Sets in Infinite-Dimensional Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of spray-invariant sets on infinite-dimensional manifolds, where any geodesic of a spray starting in the set stays within it for its entire domain. These sets, possibly including singular spaces such as stratified spaces, exhibit different geometric properties depending on their regularity: singular sets may show sensitive dependence, for example, on parametrization, whereas for differentiable submanifolds invariance is preserved under reparametrization.
  This framework offers a broader perspective on geodesic preservation than the rigid notion of totally geodesic submanifolds, with examples arising naturally even in simple settings, such as linear spaces equipped with flat sprays.</description>

      <title>Minimal $(n-2)$-umbilic submanifolds of the Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates minimal $n$-dimensional submanifolds in the Euclidean space that are $(n-2)$-umbilic, meaning they carry an umbilical distribution of rank $n-2$. We establish a correspondence between the class of minimal ($n-2$)-umbilic submanifolds and the class of ($n-2$)-singular minimal surfaces. These surfaces are the critical points of its "energy potential" and have been previously studied in various contexts, including physics and architecture where, for instance, they model surfaces with minimal potential energy under gravitational forces. We show that minimal, generic, ($n-2$)-umbilic submanifolds, $n\geq4$, are ($n-2$)-rotational submanifolds whose profile is an ($n-2$)-singular minimal surface and vise versa. Furthermore, we develop a Weierstrass type method of local parametrization of all ($n-2$)-singular minimal surfaces, enabling a parametric description of all minimal $n$-dimensional, $n\geq4$, hypersurfaces of the Euclidean space with a nowhere vanishing principal curvature of multiplicity $n-2$.</description>

      <title>Degeneration of Calabi-Yau metrics and canonical basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For polarised degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds whose essential skeleton has dimension $1\leq m\leq n$, we show that the $C^0$ potential theoretic limit of the Calabi-Yau metrics agrees with the non-archimedean Calabi-Yau metric on the Berkovich analytification. Moreover, this limit data can be encoded into the unique minimiser of the Kontorovich functional of an optimal transport problem, under some algebro-geometric assumptions on the existence of a canonical basis of sections for tensor powers of the polarisation line bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a certain class of Lorentzian manifolds, namely causal spacetimes without observer horizons, conformal transformations can be classified into two types: escaping and non-escaping. This means that successive powers of a given conformal transformation will either send all points to infinity, or none. As an application, we classify the conformal transformations of Einstein's static universe. We also study the question of essentiality in this context, i.e. which conformal transformations are isometric for some metric in the conformal class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study abnormal curves in a family of sub-Riemannian manifolds of rank 2. We focus on abnormal curves whose lifts to the cotangent bundle annihilate, at an interior point of the domain, all Lie brackets of length up to three of vector fields tangent to the distribution. We present a method to prove that such curves are length-minimizing. Finally, we prove that strictly abnormal geodesics may cease to be locally length-minimizing after a change of the metric.</description>

      <title>On Kerr black hole formation with complete apparent horizon and a new approach toward Penrose inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arising from admissible extended scale-critical short-pulse initial data, we show that 3+1 dimensional Einstein vacuum equations admit dynamical Kerr black hole formation solutions. Our hyperbolic arguments combine the scale-critical gravitational-collapse result by An--Luk with the recent breakthrough by Klainerman--Szeftel on proving nonlinear Kerr stability with small angular momentum, which requires us to perform various specific coordinate changes and frame transformations. Furthermore, allowing large spacetime angular momentum, with new elliptic arguments and precise leading order calculations, we also solve the apparent horizon in Kerr black hole formation spacetimes (including Klainerman--Szeftel's Kerr stability spacetimes) and conduct an exploration, detailing the emergence, evolution, asymptotics and final state of the apparent horizon. Building on our analysis, without time symmetric assumption, we then put forward a new mathematical framework and prove both the dynamical Penrose inequality and the spacetime Penrose inequality in our black-hole formation spacetimes and in the perturbative regime of subextremal Kerr black holes. Collectively, without assuming any symmetry, we extend Christodoulou's celebrated trapped surface formation theorem to a black hole formation result.</description>

      <title>Tunneling, the Quillen metric and analytic torsion for high powers of a holomorphic line bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2965</link>
      <description>arXiv:1106.2965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let L be a line bundle over a compact complex manifold X and endow L and TX with Hermitian metrics. Our main result provides a formula for the average distribution of the exponentially small eigenvalues of the corresponding Dolbeault Laplacians associated to high tensor powers of L; which in physics terminology is a measure of "tunneling" of the Dolbeault complex. Along the way a new proof of the asymptotics of the induced Quillen metric on the corresponding determinant line is obtained. A brief comparison with the tunneling effect for Witten Laplacians and large deviation principles for fermions is also made.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport on null hypersurfaces and the null energy condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the present work is to study optimal transport on null hypersurfaces inside Lorentzian manifolds. The challenge here is that optimal transport along a null hypersurface is completely degenerate, as the cost takes only the two values $0$ and $+\infty$.
  The tools developed in the manuscript enable to give an optimal transport characterization of the null energy condition (namely, non-negative Ricci curvature in the null directions) for Lorentzian manifolds in terms of convexity properties of the Boltzmann--Shannon entropy along null-geodesics of probability measures.
  We obtain as applications: a stability result under convergence of spacetimes, a comparison result for null-cones, and the Hawking area theorem (both in sharp form, for possibly weighted measures, and with apparently new rigidity statements).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any closed connected Riemannian spin manifold of non-zero $\hat{A}$-genus or non-zero Hitchin invariant with non-negative scalar curvature admits a parallel spinor, in particular is Ricci-flat. In this note, we generalize this result to closed connected spin manifolds of non-vanishing Rosenberg index. This provides a criterion for the existence of a parallel spinor on a finite covering and yields that any closed connected Ricci-flat spin manifold of dimension $\geq 2$ with non-vanishing Rosenberg index has special holonomy.</description>

      <title>Fine properties of nonlinear potentials and a unified perspective on monotonicity formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

      <title>AInstein: Numerical Einstein Metrics via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form $R_{\mu \nu} - \lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0$ being used as independent loss components (here $\mu,\nu = 1, 2, \cdots, n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant $\lambda \in \{+1, 0, -1\}$). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, $g' = J^T g J$, for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian $J$. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description>
