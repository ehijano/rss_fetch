      <title>Superinfection and the hypnozoite reservoir for Plasmodium vivax: a multitype branching process approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmodium vivax malaria is a mosquito-borne disease of significant public health importance. A defining feature of the within-host biology of P. vivax is the accrual of a hypnozoite reservoir, comprising a bank of quiescent parasites in the liver that are capable of causing relapsing blood-stage infections upon activation. Superinfection, characterised by composite blood-stage infections with parasites derived from multiple mosquito inoculation or hypnozoite activation events, is another important attribute. We have previously developed a stochastic epidemic model of P. vivax malaria, formulated as a Markov population process with countably infinitely-many types, that is adjusted for both hypnozoite accrual and blood-stage superinfection. Here, we construct a Markovian branching process with countably infinitely-many types to approximate the early stages of this epidemic model. With $P_M$ denoting the mosquito population size, we consider the limit $P_M \to \infty$ when the ratio of the mosquito and human populations is held fixed. We use a classical coupling argument to obtain a total variation bound of order $O(P_M^{2 \kappa - 1})$ that is valid until $o(P_M^\kappa)$ human-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human transmission events have occurred, where $\kappa &lt; 1/2$ is an arbitrary constant. We characterise the probability of global disease extinction under the branching process to approximate the probability of elimination, as opposed to sustained endemic transmission, when the epidemic model is initialised with low-level human and/or mosquito infection. We apply our model to two scenarios of epidemiological interest, namely the re-introduction of P. vivax malaria in a region where elimination has previously been achieved; and a mass drug administration campaign with population-wide depletion of the hypnozoite reservoir.</description>

      <title>First two moments and cross-moments of some coalescent times of the pure birth tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here a thorough study of the first two moments and cross-moments for the pure birth tree's height and for the coalescent time of a randomly sampled pair of tips. We consider also the first two moments of the conditional, on the tree, expectation of this coalescent time.</description>

      <title>Predictability of viral load dynamics in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 through a model-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pipeline to evaluate the evolution of viral dynamics based on a new model-driven approach has been developed in the present study. The proposed methods exploit real data and the multiscale structure of the infection dynamics to provide robust predictions of the epidemic dynamics. We focus on viral load kinetics whose dynamical features are typically available in the symptomatic stage of the infection. Hence, the epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on a compartmental approach characterized by a varying infection rate to estimate early-stage viral load dynamics, of which few data are available. We test the proposed approach with real data of SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics collected from patients living in an Italian province. The considered database refers to early-phase infections, whose viral load kinetics have not been affected by the mass vaccination policies in Italy.</description>
