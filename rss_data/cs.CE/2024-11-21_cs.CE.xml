      <title>UKFin+: A Research Agenda for Financial Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a research agenda for financial services as a deliverable of UKFin+, a Network Plus grant funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. UKFin+ fosters research collaborations between academic and non-academic partners directed at tackling complex long-term challenges relevant to the UK's financial services sector. Confronting these challenges is crucial to promote the long-term health and international competitiveness of the UK's financial services industry. As one route to impact, UKFin+ includes dedicated funding streams for research collaborations between academic researchers and non-academic organisations.
  The intended audience of this document includes researchers based in academia, academic funders, as well as practitioners based in industry, regulators, charities or NGOs. It is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive in scope but may provide applicants to UKFin+ funding streams and other funding bodies with inspiration for their proposals or at least an understanding of how their proposals align with the broader needs of the UK financial services industry.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Financial AI: Architectures, Advances and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial AI empowers sophisticated approaches to financial market forecasting, portfolio optimization, and automated trading. This survey provides a systematic analysis of these developments across three primary dimensions: predictive models that capture complex market dynamics, decision-making frameworks that optimize trading and investment strategies, and knowledge augmentation systems that leverage unstructured financial information. We examine significant innovations including foundation models for financial time series, graph-based architectures for market relationship modeling, and hierarchical frameworks for portfolio optimization. Analysis reveals crucial trade-offs between model sophistication and practical constraints, particularly in high-frequency trading applications. We identify critical gaps and open challenges between theoretical advances and industrial implementation, outlining open challenges and opportunities for improving both model performance and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>A robust shape model for blood vessels analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of digital twins for the cardiovascular system will enable insightful computational tools both for research and clinical practice. This, however, demands robust and well defined models and methods for the different steps involved in the process. We present a vessel coordinate system (VCS) that enables the unanbiguous definition of locations in a vessel section, by adapting the idea of cylindrical coordinates to the vessel geometry. Using the VCS model, point correspondence can be defined among different samples of a cohort, allowing data transfer, quantitative comparison, shape coregistration or population analysis. Furthermore, the VCS model allows for the generation of specific meshes (e.g. cylindrical grids, ogrids) necessary for an accurate reconstruction of the geometries used in fluid simulations. We provide the technical details for coordinates computation and discuss the assumptions taken to guarantee that they are well defined. The VCS model is tested in a series of applications. We present a robust, low dimensional, patient specific vascular model and use it to study phenotype variability analysis of the thoracic aorta within a cohort of patients. Point correspondence is exploited to build an haemodynamics atlas of the aorta for the same cohort. The atlas originates from fluid simulations (Navier-Stokes with Finite Volume Method) conducted using OpenFOAMv10. We finally present a relevant discussion on the VCS model, which covers its impact in important areas such as shape modeling and computer fluids dynamics (CFD).</description>

      <title>GRATEV2.0: Computational Tools for Real-time Analysis of High-throughput High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) Images of Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images is increasingly essential for advancing research in organic electronics, where precise characterization of nanoscale crystal structures is crucial for optimizing material properties. This paper introduces an open-source computational framework called GRATEV2.0 (GRaph-based Analysis of TEM), designed for real-time analysis of HRTEM data, with a focus on characterizing complex microstructures in conjugated polymers, illustrated using Poly[N-9'-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), a key material in organic photovoltaics. GRATEV2.0 employs fast, automated image processing algorithms, enabling rapid extraction of structural features like d-spacing, orientation, and crystal shape metrics. Gaussian process optimization rapidly identifies the user-defined parameters in the approach, reducing the need for manual parameter tuning and thus enhancing reproducibility and usability. Additionally, GRATEV2.0 is compatible with high-performance computing (HPC) environments, allowing for efficient, large-scale data processing at near real-time speeds. A unique feature of GRATEV2.0 is a Wasserstein distance-based stopping criterion, which optimizes data collection by determining when further sampling no longer adds statistically significant information. This capability optimizes the amount of time the TEM facility is used while ensuring data adequacy for in-depth analysis. Open-source and tested on a substantial PCDTBT dataset, this tool offers a powerful, robust, and accessible solution for high-throughput material characterization in organic electronics.</description>
