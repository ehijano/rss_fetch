      <title>Beyond Superexchange: Emergent Unconventional Ferromagnetism in Thin-Film Sandwich Structures of Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the nature of magnetic interactions in intrinsic magnetic topological insulator Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (MBST in short) systems, which possesses highly-ordered ferromagnetic septuple-layers (SLs), using two types of structures: MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 heterostructures and MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3/MBST(1 SL) sandwich structures. The out-of-plane magnetization in the sandwich structure turned out to be significantly larger than that in the heterostructure, indicating that the interlayer magnetic interaction between two MBST layers is ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the Curie temperature increased with decreasing the in-plane Mn-Mn distance in the MBST layer, which suggests the enhancement of the intralayer ferromagnetic interaction within each MBST layer. Meanwhile, in the sandwich structures with various spacer thicknesses, the Curie temperature with the spacer layer was higher than that with no spacer layer. In addition, the curve shape of anomalous Hall effects for the sandwich structure was almost unchanged by carrier-density modulation, which implies that the ferromagnetism in this system is carrier-independent. Based on the above results, magnetic behaviors in our systems cannot be explained only by the direct exchange nor superexchange interactions reported previously for MBST systems, and are instead proposed to arise from topology-related mechanisms such as the van Vleck and Bloembergen-Rowland mechanisms. This work provides a new perspective on magnetic mechanisms in MBST systems, which helps us to realize next-generation spintronic and electronic devices by flexibly controlling magnetism in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-temperature specific heat of solids and the rationale behind the Maier-Kelley empirical formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heat capacity of solids at intermediate-to-high temperatures is of fundamental importance to several fields ranging from geology to material science. It depends on a variety of factors, with anharmonicity and, ultimately, melting playing a pivotal role. In this work we develop a first-principles model from an analytically tractable semi-harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The resulting specific heat expression depends not only on the Einstein temperature of the material but also on other physical parameters. We compare our predictions with experimental data for copper, aluminum, lead, silicon, and germanium with rather satisfactory results, especially considering that there are no fitting parameters in our theory. We finish this work by showing that our results formally justify the otherwise purely empirical formula by Maier and Kelley, also providing its coefficients in terms of elementary physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Discovering correlations between metal foam thermal characteristics and non-Fourier behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their low density and large specific surface area, metal foams are increasingly used as cellular materials that combine excellent structural and thermal properties. Their cellular structure makes them particularly suitable for use in heat exchangers, insulation, and fire protection layers. The heat transport that takes place within them is a complex phenomenon characterized by the simultaneous presence of heat conduction, heat transfer, and heat radiation, making their modeling a significant challenge. The aim of the research is to develop a one-dimensional, time-dependent, discrete numerical model capable of describing the effective thermal behavior of metal foams. The model takes into account heat conduction through the solid phase, conductive heat transfer in the closed cavities, thermal radiation between the pore walls, and by-passing heat conduction around the cavity. The results highlight that geometric features such as cavity size and arrangement have a significant impact on temperature distribution and confirm that classical Fourier-based models are not accurately applicable to porous materials, but the Guyer--Krumhansl equation is an adequate candidate. Furthermore, we correlated the static and dynamic thermal diffusivity with the metal foam parameters, showing a significant sensitivity to the cavity thermal attributes.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in continuously monitored boundary time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in boundary time crystals (BTCs) via continuous monitoring. By analytically deriving the global quantum Fisher information rate, we show that in the time-crystal phase the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$, surpassing both the sensitivity at the critical point and the standard quantum limit (SQL). We then numerically demonstrate that this bound can be attained already at finite $N$ using experimentally accessible strategies: continuous photodetection and, in particular, continuous homodyne detection. Moving towards realistic implementations, we derive the fundamental precision limits for inefficient detection ($\eta&lt;1$). While inefficiencies asymptotically restore SQL scaling, a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible, diverging as $\eta\!\to\!1$. Numerical simulations show that homodyne detection outperforms photodetection in approaching the ultimate bound and consistently provides a collective advantage over independent single-qubit protocols, which grows with $N$.</description>
