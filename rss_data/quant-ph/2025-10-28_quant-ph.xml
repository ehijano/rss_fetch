      <title>Unified Framework for Direct and Complete Characterization of an Unknown Kraus Operator and Density Matrix Using a Single Input State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of quantum measurements and dynamical processes is typically performed using pure state preparations. However, in realistic experimental settings, the preparation of pure states is often infeasible due to noise and system constraints. In this work, we present a unified framework that enables the direct and complete characterization of an unknown Kraus operator using only a single input state. The same framework also supports the characterization of unknown observable, unitary operator, and density matrix. Remarkably, all these tasks are accomplished using a single input state, a set of projector-based unitary evolution operators, and the measurement of a single observable. Importantly, our approach imposes no constraints on the strength of the coupling between the system and a probe.</description>

      <title>From Cables to Qubits: A Decomposed Variational Quantum Optimization Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cable Routing Optimization Problem (CROP) is a multi-flow routing task central to industrial layouts and smart manufacturing installations. We formulate CROP as a cable-wise separable, block-diagonal Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Problem (QUBO) and derive conservative penalty bounds that preserve feasibility. Exploiting this structure, we introduce a decomposition pipeline that builds one QUBO per cable, transforms each QUBO into a Hamiltonian and solves the subproblems with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Finally, the solutions per cable are merged into a global routing assignment. This procedure reduces the per-run qubits from the full problem size to those of a single-cable subproblem. We test our performance on different cable routing optimization problems varying in size using Qiskit's SamplingVQE. Our findings indicate that a decomposed VQE approach attains feasible and optimal layouts across a range of cable-routing problems.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity Hierarchies in Solvable Quantum Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence matrix (IM) provides a powerful framework for characterizing nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics by encoding multitime correlations into tensor-network states. Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>The evolution of Liouville von Neumann master equations in the Pechukas-Yukawa framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel formalism for the out of equilibrium dynamics of the density matrix, capable of describing highly entangled many-body interactions. The evolution of quantum states is evaluated via eigenvalue dynamics of a general Hamiltonian system, perturbed by a parametrically evolving variable $\lambda(t)$ that carries the time-dependence. This is achieved using the Pechukas-Yukawa mapping of the evolution of the energy levels governed by their initial conditions on a generalised Calogero-Sutherland model of a 1D classical gas. As such, quantum systems can be described exactly in their entirety from eigenvalue dynamics. Under this description, we provide an improved understanding of the relationship between nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions and decoherence which has significant impacts to a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Form-preserving transformations of wave and Wigner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation are mapped to other solutions for a (possibly) different potential by so-called form-preserving transformations. These time-dependent transformations of the space and time coordinates can produce remarkable solutions with surprising properties. A classic example is the force-free accelerating Airy beam found by Berry and Balazs. We review the 1-dimensional form-preserving transformations and show that they also yield Senitzky coherent excited states and the free dispersion of any harmonic-oscillator stationary state. Form preservation of the $D$- and 3-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with both a scalar and a vector potential is then considered. Time-dependent rotations may be included when a vector potential is present; we find a general transformation formula for this case. Quantum form-preserving maps are also considered in phase space. First, the wave-function transformation is shown to produce a simple result for Wigner functions: they transform as a true phase-space probability would. The explicit transformation formula explains and generalizes the rigid evolution of curves in phase space that characterize the Airy beam and the coherent excited states. Then we recover the known form-preserving transformations from the Moyal equation obeyed by Wigner functions.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of Acceptable Defectiveness: Redefining Surface Code Robustness under Heterogeneous Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of past research on superconducting qubits shows that these devices exhibit considerable variation and thus cannot be accurately depicted by a uniform noise model. To combat this often unrealistic picture of homogeneous noise in quantum processors during runtime, our work aims to define the boundaries of acceptable defectiveness (BADs), or the upper boundary of a qubits physical error, past which this defective qubit entirely degrades the logical computation and should be considered faulty and removed from the surface code mapping. Using the QEC simulation package STIM, repetition code circuits on rotated surface codes were generated, sampled, and analyzed from distances 3 to 17, with various defective error rates and outlier defect locations. In addition, we simulated heterogeneous noise models using the same parameters to test how increasingly deviated distributions of physical errors scale across code distances under realistic, heterogeneous noise models that are informed by current superconducting hardware. The results suggest that there are, in fact, boundaries of acceptable defectiveness in which a defective qubit, with a physical error rate $&lt;= .75$\%, can be left in the lattice with negligible impact on logical error rate given sufficient code distances and proper placement in the lattice. On the other hand, we find that substantial qubit variation around a seemingly acceptable physical error rate can severely degrade logical qubit performance. As a result, we propose that defectiveness of both individual qubits and the overall uniformity of lattice fidelity should not be viewed as all or nothing, but instead as a spectrum. Our research demonstrates how heterogeneity directly impacts logical error rate and provides preliminary goals and metrics for hardware designers to meet in order to achieve target logical performance with imperfect, non-uniform qubit qualities.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic-Recursive Approach to Generate Higher-Order Symmetry Operators for Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores an algebraic-recursive approach to construct differential operators that commute with a central operator $\hat{H}$ in quantum mechanics. Starting from the Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle, the work derives first-order symmetry generators, such as translations, rotations, and boosts, and examines their algebraic basis encompassing Lie and Jordan algebras. The analysis is then extended to higher-order operators, demonstrating how they can be constructed from the first-order ones through algebraic operations and Lie algebra simplification. This methodology is applied to the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski space-time, yielding relativistic symmetry operators. Furthermore, we defined an approximation to fractional symmetry operators of the Schrodinger equation, and a perturbative approach is employed for a case where the commutation is more general, illustrated with a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the fourth-order Klein-Gordon equation. The results include a general formula for the number of operators as a function of the order and the dimension of the algebraic basis, providing a reduced-form development of the differential higher-order centralizers' basis.</description>

      <title>Effect of Stochastic Charge Noise in Si/SiGe Quantum-Dot Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Si/SiGe quantum dots, the decoherence behavior of spin qubits usually comes from the non-Markovian effect of the charge noise. To improve the performance of using the coherent noise models in the decoherence simulation and tomography analysis, here we propose a spin-phonon model derived from the electric dipole spin resonance to characterize the decoherence behavior of the spin qubit in a Si/SiGe quantum dot. Utilizing a 1/f spectrum to characterize quantum noise correlation, our stochastic model can yield a more precise prediction of decoherence compared to a random coherence model. We also use gate set tomography (GST) to address the error generator and analyze the model violation coming from the non-Markovian effect. Based on the results, we attribute certain error generators of this model to the incoherence error, which avoids the scenario of using too large a coherent noise strength in the previous study to account for the experimentally observed decoherence times, and thus underestimates the gate fidelity. We also perform a gate optimization and show that our optimized control pulse can substantially reduce the error contribution of the incoherent non-Markovian 1/f charge noise. We further demonstrate that the optimized pulse against incoherent noise is more robust against coherent noise than the regular Gaussian pulse through a filter function analysis in a CPMG protocol, demonstrating the significant effectiveness of the optimized pulse.</description>

      <title>HPC-Driven Modeling with ML-Based Surrogates for Magnon-Photon Dynamics in Hybrid Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating hybrid magnonic quantum systems remains a challenge due to the large disparity between the timescales of the two systems. We present a massively parallel GPU-based simulation framework that enables fully coupled, large-scale modeling of on-chip magnon-photon circuits. Our approach resolves the dynamic interaction between ferromagnetic and electromagnetic fields with high spatiotemporal fidelity. To accelerate design workflows, we develop a physics-informed machine learning surrogate trained on the simulation data, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields. By addressing the multiscale and multiphysics challenges in magnon-photon modeling, our framework enables scalable simulation and rapid prototyping of next-generation quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Floquet Engineering of Bosonic Codes via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic codes represent a promising route toward quantum error correction in continuous-variable systems, with direct relevance to experimental platforms such as circuit QED and optomechanics. However, their preparation and stabilization remain highly challenging, requiring ultra-precise control of nonlinear interactions to create entangled superpositions, suppress decoherence, and mitigate dynamic errors. Here, we introduce a reinforcement-learning-assisted Floquet engineering approach for the autonomous preparation of bosonic codes that is general, efficient, and noise-resilient. By leveraging machine learning to optimize Floquet driving parameters, our method achieves over two orders of magnitude reduction in evolution time-requiring only about one percent of that in conventional adiabatic schemes-while maintaining high-fidelity state generation even under strong dissipative and dephasing noise. This approach not only demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence in quantum control but also establishes a scalable and experimentally feasible route toward fault-tolerant bosonic quantum computation. Beyond the specific application to bosonic code preparation, our results suggest a general paradigm for integrating machine learning and Floquet engineering to overcome decoherence challenges in next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Rigorous test of the Raleigh-Ritz method for Mexican hat type potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interesting quantum integrable models are rare and one often has to resort to approximation methods. One of these is the Raleigh Ritz method which under certain circumstances allows to approximately compute the lowest energy eigenstate (or ground state) of a given Hamiltonian whose pure point spectrum is bounded from below. The quality of such approximations can then be tested numerically or sometimes by abstract arguments.
  However, the numerical test is limited by computing power. In order to perform a rigorous test, one would need to have at one's disposal 1. a physically interesting model that is 2. solvable to sufficient extent in order that 3. the exact ground state is known in closed form.
  In this contribution we show that certain anharmonic potentials of the Mexican hat type belong to this class of models. The corresponding Schroedinger type Hamiltonian can be considered as a crude quantum mechanical toy model Hamiltonian for the Higgs field in the standard model of elementary particle physics.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in stabilizer entropy densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability distribution of a measure of non-stabilizerness, also known as magic, is investigated for Haar-random pure quantum states. Focusing on the stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, the associated probability density functions (PDFs) are found to display distinct non-analytic features analogous to Van Hove singularities in condensed matter systems. For a single qubit, the stabilizer purity exhibits a logarithmic divergence at a critical value corresponding to a saddle point on the Bloch sphere. This divergence occurs at the $|H\rangle$-magic states, which hence can be identified as states for which the density of non-stabilizerness in the Hilbert space is infinite. An exact expression for the PDF is derived for the case $\alpha = 2$, with analytical predictions confirmed by numerical simulations. The logarithmic divergence disappears for dimensions $d \ge 3$, in agreement with the behavior of ordinary Van Hove singularities on flat manifolds. In addition, it is shown that, for one qubit, the linear stabilizer entropy is directly related to the partial incompatibility of quantum measurements, one of the defining properties of quantum mechanics, at the basis of Stern-Gerlach experiments.</description>

      <title>Pauli Propagation: Simulating Quantum Spin Dynamics via Operator Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating real-time quantum dynamics in interacting spin systems is a fundamental challenge, where exact diagonalization suffers from exponential Hilbert-space growth and tensor-network methods face entanglement barriers. In this work, we introduce a scalable Pauli propagation approach that evolves local observables directly in the Heisenberg picture. Theoretically, we derive a priori error bounds governed by the Operator Stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (OSE) $\mathcal{S}^\alpha(O)$, which explicitly links the truncation accuracy to operator complexity and prescribes a suitable Top-$K$ truncation strategy. For the 1D Heisenberg model with $J_z = 0$, we prove the number of non-zero Pauli coefficients scales quadratically in Trotter steps, establishing the compressibility of Heisenberg-evolved operators. Numerically, we validate the framework on XXZ Heisenberg chain benchmarks, showing high accuracy with small $K$ in free regimes ($J_z = 0$) and competitive performance against tensor-network methods (e.g., TDVP) in interacting cases ($J_z = 0.5$). These results establish an observable-centric simulator whose cost is governed by operator complexity rather than entanglement, offering a practical alternative for studying non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A simple electromagnetic model of the electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a toroidal electromagnetic ansatz that provides a realistic microscopic model of the QED electron. The proposed toroidal electromagnetic wave satisfies Maxwell's equations and reproduces fundamental properties of the electron as described in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Within this framework, the electron is modeled as a rotating electromagnetic wave confined to a toroidal geometry. Parameter optimization yields quantitative agreement with the electron charge e, spin $\hbar/2$, and magnetic moment $\mu_B(1 + \alpha/2\pi)$, incorporating the Schwinger anomalous magnetic moment correction. The model yields an amplitude on the order of the Schwinger scale where electron-positron pair production occurs. The major radius corresponds to the Compton wavelength scale, while the monochromatic frequency is consistent with the de Broglie-Dirac frequency. The phase velocity is found to be $2c$, and the computed rest energy approximates $0.8 m_e c^2$. This representation provides a microscopic classical electromagnetic framework that encapsulates the properties of the QED electron.</description>

      <title>Making the Virtual Real: Measurement-Powered Tunneling Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum tunneling allows electrons to be transferred between two regions separated by an energetically forbidden barrier. Performing a position measurement that finds a particle in the barrier forces the tunneling electrons to transition from having a classically forbidden energy to an energy above the barrier height. We exploit this effect to define quantum tunneling engines that can use the unconditioned detection of virtually occupied states as a resource for power generation and cooling. Leveraging energy exchange with the detector, we show that the device can operate in a hybrid regime, enabling simultaneous cooling and power generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-assisted autonomous refrigeration and "checkpoint" cooling driven purely by a thermal bias, without the need for an applied potential. We also find a "purification-by-noise" effect when the measurement drives the system into a stationary dark state. These results underscore the intriguing dual role of measurement as a thermodynamic resource and a dark state generator.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Certainty: Shot Budgets in Quantum Program Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances toward early fault-tolerant machines, testing and verification of quantum programs become urgent but costly, since each execution consumes scarce hardware resources. Unlike in classical software testing, every measurement must be carefully budgeted.
  This paper develops a unified framework for reasoning about how many measurements are required to verify quantum programs. The goal is to connect theoretical error bounds with concrete test strategies and to extend the analysis from individual tests to full program-level verification.
  We analyze the relationship between error probability, fidelity, trace distance, and the quantum Chernoff bound to establish fundamental shot count limits. These foundations are applied to three representative testing methods: the inverse test, the swap test, and the chi-square test. Both idealized and noisy devices are considered. We also introduce a program-level budgeting approach that allocates verification effort across multiple subroutines.
  The inverse test is the most measurement efficient, the swap test requires about twice as many shots, and the chi-square test is easiest to implement but often needs orders of magnitude more measurements. In the presence of noise, calibrated baselines may increase measurement requirements beyond theoretical estimates. At the program level, distributing a global fidelity target across many fine-grained functions can cause verification costs to grow rapidly, whereas coarser decompositions or weighted allocations remain more practical.
  The framework clarifies trade-offs among different testing strategies, noise handling, and program decomposition. It provides practical guidance for budgeting measurement shots in quantum program testing, helping practitioners balance rigour against cost when designing verification strategies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement as a Strategic Resource in Adversarial Quantum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum game theory naturally extends classical strategic decision-making by
  leveraging quantum superposition, entanglement, and measurement-based pay offs. This paper introduces a novel team-based Quantum Sabotage Game (QSG),
  where two competing teams, one classical and one quantum-enhanced, engage in
  adversarial strategies. Unlike classical models, quantum teams can capitalize on
  entanglement-assisted coordination, enabling correlated sabotage actions that
  provide a decisive edge in unpredictability and strategic deception. We establish
  a formal quantum game-theoretic model and derive the Quantum Nash Equilib rium (QNE) conditions for multi-agent interactions. Our approach uses computa tional simulations to directly compare classical and quantum strategic efficiency
  under ideal conditions, standard quantum noise models, and noise profiles
  calibrated from real IBM Quantum hardware. Our analysis specifically com pares teams of equivalent size: two-player classical (2C) versus Bell-state (2Q)
  teams, and three-player classical (3C) versus W-state (3Q) teams. Our results
  indicate that W-state entanglement significantly enhances both defensive coordi nation and sabotage effectiveness, consistently outperforming standard classical
  strategies and Bell-state coordination schemes. This quantum advantage is
  shown to be resilient, persisting even when subjected to realistic hardware noise
  models. These findings have direct implications for quantum-enhanced cybersecu rity, adversarial artificial intelligence, and multi-agent quantum decision-making,
  thereby paving the way for practical applications of quantum game theory in
  competitive environments</description>

      <title>Single-photon superradiance and subradiance in helical collectives of quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective emission of light from distributions of two-level systems (TLSs) was first predicted in 1954 by Robert Dicke, who showed that when $N$ quantum emitters absorb photons, their collective radiative decay rate can be enhanced (superradiance) or suppressed (subradiance) relative to a single emitter. In this work, we derive novel analytical expressions for the collective decay rates and Lamb shifts for the interaction of a single photon with a continuous distribution of TLSs on an infinite line and an infinite helix. We compare these solutions to collectives of TLSs on a cylinder, finding limits in which the eigenvalues of structures of different dimensions are equal. We also compare our solution with arrangements where the emitter distribution is discrete rather than continuous, and when short- ($1/r^3$), intermediate- ($1/r^2$), and long-range ($1/r$) interaction terms are included. We find important differences between the discrete vector and continuous scalar emitter cases, which do not agree in the limit where discrete spacing goes to 0. The analytical solution for the helix is then used to make estimates of the maximally superradiant state, thermally averaged collective decay rate, and percentage of trapped states of quantum emitter architectures in protein fibers. Given the differences between our idealized infinite helix and the numerical model describing protein fibers, our analytical estimates show excellent agreement with the numerical results for sparse arrangements of emitters in protein fibers. Our work thus bridges the gap between different formalisms for superradiance, aids the engineering of devices which harness quantum optical effects for computing with superradiant error correction and subradiant memories, and motivates the discovery and creation of flexible platforms for quantum information processing using the intrinsic helical geometries of biomatter.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Theory of Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm is one of the most promising variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), bridging the current era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices and the future of fully fault-tolerant quantum computing. Although practical demonstrations of QITE and its potential advantages over the general VQA trained with vanilla gradient descent (GD) in certain tasks have been reported, a first-principle, theoretical understanding of QITE remains limited. Here, we aim to develop an analytic theory for the dynamics of QITE. First, we show that QITE can be interpreted as a form of a general VQA trained with Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNGD), where the inverse quantum Fisher information matrix serves as the learning-rate tensor. This equivalence is established not only at the level of gradient update rules, but also through the action principle: the variational principle can be directly connected to the geometric geodesic distance in the quantum Fisher information metric, up to an integration constant. Second, for wide quantum neural networks, we employ the quantum neural tangent kernel framework to construct an analytic model for QITE. We prove that QITE always converges faster than GD-based VQA, though this advantage is suppressed by the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension. This helps explain certain experimental results in quantum computational chemistry. Our theory encompasses linear, quadratic, and more general loss functions. We validate the analytic results through numerical simulations. Our findings establish a theoretical foundation for QITE dynamics and provide analytic insights for the first-principle design of variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Experimental Proposal on Scalable Radio-Frequency Magnetometer with Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnetometry represents a fundamental component of quantum metrology, where trapped-ion systems have achieved $\rm{pT}/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ sensitivity in single-ion radio-frequency magnetic field measurements via dressed states based dynamical decoupling. Here we propose a scalable trapped-ion magnetometer utilizing the mixed dynamical decoupling method, combining dressed states with periodic sequences to suppress decoherence and spatial magnetic field inhomogeneity. With numerical simulations for a $10^4$ ion system with realistic experimental parameters, we demonstrate that a sensitivity of 13 $\rm{fT}/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ for the radio-frequency field could be reached. Such a sensitivity could be obtained via robust resilience to magnetic field drift noise and inhomogeneity, where coherence time could be extended to the order of several minutes on average. This method enables scalable trapped-ion magnetometry, demonstrating its potential as a robust and practical solution for advancing quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>qc-kmeans: A Quantum Compressive K-Means Algorithm for NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering on NISQ hardware is constrained by data loading and limited qubits. We present \textbf{qc-kmeans}, a hybrid compressive $k$-means that summarizes a dataset with a constant-size Fourier-feature sketch and selects centroids by solving small per-group QUBOs with shallow QAOA circuits. The QFF sketch estimator is unbiased with mean-squared error $O(\varepsilon^2)$ for $B,S=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$, and the peak-qubit requirement $q_{\text{peak}}=\max\{D,\lceil \log_2 B\rceil + 1\}$ does not scale with the number of samples. A refinement step with elitist retention ensures non-increasing surrogate cost. In Qiskit Aer simulations (depth $p{=}1$), the method ran with $\le 9$ qubits on low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks and achieved competitive sum-of-squared errors relative to quantum baselines; runtimes are not directly comparable. On nine real datasets (up to $4.3\times 10^5$ points), the pipeline maintained constant peak-qubit usage in simulation. Under IBM noise models, accuracy was similar to the idealized setting. Overall, qc-kmeans offers a NISQ-oriented formulation with shallow, bounded-width circuits and competitive clustering quality in simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

      <title>Open harmonic chain without secular approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particle and energy transport in an open quantum system consisting of a three harmonic oscillator chain coupled to thermal baths at different temperatures placed at the ends of the chain. We consider the exact dynamics of the open chain and its so-called local and global Markovian approximations. By comparing them, we show that, while all three yield a divergence-like continuity equation for the probability flow, the energy flow exhibits instead a distinct behavior. The exact dynamics and the local one preserve a standard divergence form for the energy transport, whereas the global open dynamics, due to the rotating wave approximation (RWA), introduces non-divergence sink/source terms. These terms also affect the continuity equation in the case of a master equation obtained through a time-coarse-graining method whereby RWA is avoided through a time-zoom parameter $\Delta t$. In such a scenario, sink and source contributions are always present for each $\Delta t&gt;0$. While in the limit $\Delta t\to+\infty$ one recovers the global dissipative dynamics, sink and source terms instead vanish when $\Delta t\to 0$, restoring the divergence structure of the exact dynamics. Our results underscore how the choice of the dissipative Markovian approximation to an open system dynamics critically influences the energy transport descriptions, with implications for discriminating among them and thus, ultimately, for the correct modeling of the time-evolution of open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Generation and Detection of Hyperentangled Bell States at an Ultra-High Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate both the generation and detection of an ultra-high flux of polarization Bell states using broadband hyper-entangled bi-photons that are quantum-correlated in both polarization and time-energy. Bell states of polarization embody the most basic form of two-state entanglement, and are a key component of quantum protocols of communication and sensing. High-speed generation, processing and detection of polarization Bell-states is therefore critical for quantum technology. However, all current protocols that employ polarization entangled photons are inherently slow, primarily due to the photo-detectors (Photomultiplier tubes, avalanche photo-diodes, etc.) that can handle only $10^{6-7}$ photons/s, whereas sources may easily produce $10^{10-13}$ photons/s or more (if properly designed). We fully alleviate this detection bottleneck by resorting to physical detection of the bi-photons with nonlinear interferometry. We harness a generalized, dual polarization SU1,1 interferometer to generate, manipulate \textit{and measure} all the triplet Bell-states at a flux of $\sim\!5\times10^{11}$ photons/s, enhancing the speed of quantum processing by &gt;5 orders of magnitude compared to standard methods.</description>

      <title>Scalable Neural Decoders for Practical Real-Time Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time, scalable, and accurate decoding is a critical component for realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. While Transformer-based neural decoders such as \textit{AlphaQubit} have demonstrated high accuracy, the computational complexity of their core attention mechanism, which scales as $\mathcal{O}(d^4)$ with code distance $d$, results in decoding speeds insufficient for practical real-time applications. In this work, we introduce and evaluate a \textit{Mamba}-based decoder, a state-space model with $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ complexity. In memory experiments using Sycamore hardware data, our Mamba decoder matches the performance of its Transformer-based counterpart, providing that its superior efficiency does not come at the cost of performance. Crucially, in simulated real-time scenarios that account for decoder-induced noise, the Mamba decoder significantly outperforms the Transformer, exhibiting a higher error threshold of $0.0104$ compared to $0.0097$. These results demonstrate that Mamba decoders offer a compelling balance between speed and accuracy, making them a promising architecture for scalable, real-time quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Reducing Ion Heating in Quantum Computing: A Novel 3D-Printed Micro Ion Trap with Skeleton Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric-field-induced ion heating is a major obstacle in scalable trapped-ion quantum computing. We present a theoretical study of a novel 3D-printed ion trap with a skeleton electrode structure, designed to reduce heating by minimizing surface area near the ion. Compared to a conventional blade trap with identical confinement parameters, the skeleton trap achieves over 50% reduction in total heating rate. Patch-by-patch analysis reveals that heating is dominated by surfaces within 500 {\mu}m of the ion. For axial motion, the peak heating occurs approximately 110 {\mu}m away due to electric field directionality. We demonstrate that minor geometric optimization, in which the electrode gaps are realigned with these hotspots, can further suppress heating despite the associated increase in surface area. A linear relationship between ion-to-electrode distance and peak heating location is also established. These results highlight the potential of 3D-printed electrode designs for achieving both strong confinement and reduced noise in future quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Qlustering: Harnessing Network-Based Quantum Transport for Data Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Qlustering, a quantum-inspired algorithm for unsupervised learning that leverages network-based quantum transport to perform data clustering. In contrast to traditional distance-based methods, Qlustering treats the steady-state dynamics of quantum particles propagating through a network as a computational resource. Data are encoded as input states in a tight-binding Hamiltonian framework governed by the Lindblad master equation, and cluster assignments emerge from steady-state output currents at terminal nodes. The algorithm iteratively optimizes the network's Hamiltonian to minimize a physically motivated cost function, achieving convergence through stochastic updates. We benchmark Qlustering on synthetic datasets, a localization problem, and real-world chemical and biological data, namely subsets of the QM9 molecular database and the Iris dataset. Across these diverse tasks, Qlustering demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared with classical methods such as k-means, particularly for non-convex or high-dimensional data. Its intrinsic robustness, low computational complexity, and compatibility with photonic implementations suggest a promising route toward physically realizable, quantum-native clustering architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that spin-flip probabilities emerge in the relativistic regime for scalar potentials, absent in the standard Dirac representation. We examine 1D scattering for the Dirac equation with the matrix representation introduced by the Author in an earlier study. The dispersion relation described by the equation is that of a relativistic particle. We demonstrate that the transmission T and reflection R coefficients can depend on the chosen representation of the Clifford algebra despite the two representations being related by a unitary transformation. This representation dependence hints at hidden physics in how spinor components couple to external steps/barriers, even when the relativistic dispersion relation E^2=p^2+m^2 is the same.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work theoretically investigates possibilities of using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) and its variants to control a coherent superposition of quantum states. We present a generalization of the so-called fractional STIRAP (f-STIRAP), demonstrating precise control over the mixing ratio of quantum states in the wave packet. In contrast to conventional f-STIRAP, designed to drive a system from an eigenstate into a coherent superposition, our scheme enables arbitrary control over the composition of an already existing superposition state. We demonstrate that an approximate version of this technique -- where analytically designed laser pulses with composite envelopes are replaced by simple Gaussian pulses -- achieves comparable performance in controlling the dynamics of the wave packet. A limiting case of this scheme, utilizing two pulses with identical Gaussians envelopes and tuned delay and relative phase, is also explored, revealing experimentally accessible pathways for manipulating quantum coherence. We apply our developed techniques to control the ultrafast charge migration in the spin-orbit split ground electronic states of xenon cation via intermediate valence- and core-excited states. Finally, we propose concrete experimental realizations of the developed control schemes in combination with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a method to probe the system.</description>

      <title>Reducing measurements in quantum erasure correction by quantum local recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As measurements are costly and prone to errors on certain quantum computing devices, we should reduce the number of measurements and the number of measured qudits as small as possible in quantum erasure correction. It is intuitively obvious that a decoder can omit measurements of stabilizers that are irrelevant to erased qudits, but this intuition has not been rigorously formalized as far as the author is aware. In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measuring stabilizer observables is also clarified, which looks similar to the dimension length profile of classical linear codes. As an application, we also show that correction of $\delta$ erasures on a generalized surface code proposed by Delfosse, Iyer and Poulin requires at most $\delta$ measurements of vertexes and at most $\delta$ measurements of faces, independently of its code parameters.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-rate detection of entangled photon pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-rate detection of entangled photons is essential for advancing photonic quantum information processing. Although several experimental demonstrations have been reported, the achievable coincidence rates have so far remained limited. One of the main bottlenecks arises from the dead time of single-photon detectors, which constrains coincidence detection at high photon-pair generation rates. In this work, we employ 16-pixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) to mitigate the impact of detector dead time. Consequently, we achieve coincidence rates exceeding 3 million counts per second (Mcps) in two-photon interference and CHSH inequality experiments using 5-GHz clocked sequential time-bin entangled photon pair source. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of multi-Mcps coincidence detection of entangled photons, paving the way for high-speed entangled-photon-based quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Giant-Atom Quantum Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmentally induced decoherence poses a fundamental challenge to quantum energy storage systems, causing irreversible energy dissipation and performance aging of quantum batteries (QBs). To address this issue, we propose a QB protocol utilizing the nonlocal coupling properties of giant atoms (GAs). In this architecture, both the QB and its charger are implemented as superconducting GAs with multiple nonlocal coupling points to a shared microwave waveguide. By engineering these atoms in a braided configuration, where their coupling paths are spatially interleaved, we show the emergence of decoherence-immune interaction dynamics. This unique geometry enables destructive interference between decoherence channels while preserving coherent energy transfer between the charger and the QB, thereby effectively suppressing the aging effects induced by waveguide-mediated dissipation. The charging properties of separated and nested coupled configurations are investigated. The results show that these two configurations underperform the braided configuration. Additionally, we propose a long-range chiral charging scheme that facilitates unidirectional energy transfer between the charger and the battery, with the capability to reverse the flow direction by modulating the applied magnetic flux. Our result provides guidelines for implementing a decoherence-resistant charging protocol and remote chiral QBs in circuits with GAs engineering.</description>

      <title>Experimental Multipartite Entanglement Detection With Minimal-Size Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparticle entanglement is a valuable resource for quantum technologies, including measurement based quantum computing, quantum secret sharing, and a variety of quantum sensing applications. The direct way to detect this resource is to observe correlations arising from local measurements performed simultaneously on all particles. However, this approach is increasingly vulnerable to measurement imperfections when the number of particles grows, and becomes unfeasible for large-scale entangled states. It is therefore crucial to devise detection methods that minimize the number of simultaneously measured particles. Here we provide the first experimental demonstration of multipartite entanglement detection with minimal-size correlations, showing that our setup is robust to misalignment of the local measurement bases and enables the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement in a regime where the direct approach fails. Overall, our results indicate a promising route to the experimental detection of genuine multipartite entanglement in large-scale entangled states.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature Casimir effect in one-dimensional scalar field with double delta-function potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature Casimir effect for a (1+1)-dimensional scalar field interacting with a pair of delta-function potentials. We employ the canonical quantization method to compute the Casimir force and entropy, contrasting the results with those from the standard Lifshitz theory. At zero temperature, both frameworks yield identical forces. For the finite-temperature case, we find that in the long-distance limit, the Casimir force decays asymptotically as $F_C(a,T)=-T/(4a)$, with the Lifshitz theory predicting a magnitude twice as large as that from canonical quantization. Crucially, the canonical quantization method yields a physically consistent entropy that remains positive and increases with temperature. These results demonstrate the robustness of the canonical quantization approach in providing a thermodynamically sound description of the thermal Casimir effect in this system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Oscillatory Unruh Effect with Superposed Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unruh effect predicts an astonishing phenomenon that an accelerated detector would detect counts despite being in a quantum field vacuum in the rest frame. Since the required detector acceleration for its direct observation is prohibitively large, recent analog studies on quantum simulation platforms help to reveal various properties of the Unruh effect and explore the not-yet-understood physics of quantum gravity. To further reveal the quantum aspect of the Unruh effect, analogous experimental exploration of the correlation between the detector and the field, and the consequences for coherent quantum trajectories of the detector without classical counterparts, are essential steps but are currently missing. Here, we utilize a laser-controlled trapped ion to experimentally simulate an oscillating detector coupled with a cavity field. We observe joint excitation of both the detector and the field in the detector's frame, coincide with the coordinated dynamics predicted by the Unruh effect. Particularly, we simulate the detector moving in single and superposed quantum trajectories, where the latter case shows coherent interference of excitation. Our demonstration reveals properties of quantum coherent superposition of accelerating trajectories associated with quantum gravity theories that have no classical counterparts, and may offer a new avenue to investigate phenomena in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. We also show how a generalization of the method and results in this work may be beneficial for direct observation of the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Repeated generalized measurements generated quantum trajectories without stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the issue of quantum trajectories generated by repeated POVM and QND measurements acting on a single copy of a system in an unknown state. After an introduction to various aspects of quantum measurements, and an earlier work based on gaussian measurements, which showed the impossibility of determining the unknown state by such repeated measurements, we present the current work based on martingale properties of certain quantities along the trajectory and their convergence from martingale convergence theorems. The main result is that asymptotically all trajectories approach either non degenerate eigenstates or density matrices spanned by the degenerate eigenstates. A unified treatment of both the degenerate and non degenerate cases is given with the help of higher dimensional projectors. The Luders prescription is reproduced for the degenerate case. The distribution of trajectories is shown to be given by the Born rule. Similar conclusions had already been reached by Bauer et al as well as by Amini et al. A detailed comparison of the three approaches is given. All the three avoid using stochastic differential equations. Alter and Yamamoto were the first to investigate repeated measurements on single copies. We make a detailed comparison with their works too. We end with a brief discussion of the robustness of the results against free evolutions as well as some anti-Zeno aspects of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically derive the dark-state covariance matrix of a driven multi-ensemble superradiant system in the large-$N$ limit, revealing entanglement among the ensembles that enhances quantum metrology. The minimum eigenvalue, linked to the curvature of the superradiance potential trapping the dark state, corresponds to the optimal multiparameter squeezing coefficient, defined as the Rayleigh quotient of the squeezing matrix. This system provides a concrete protocol for achieving optimal quantum enhancement in arbitrary multiparameter estimation tasks, making it a promising candidate for multimode quantum interferometry.</description>

      <title>Size-consistent implementation of Hamiltonian simulation-based quantum-selected configuration interaction method for the supramolecular approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method is a promising approach for large-scale quantum chemical calculations on currently available quantum hardware. However, its naive implementation lacks size consistency, which is essential for accurate intermolecular interaction energy calculations using the supramolecular approach. Here, we present a size-consistent implementation of QSCI by sampling Slater determinants for the dimer in the localized molecular orbital basis, constructing the subspaces for the monomers and dimer, and augmenting the dimer subspace with additional determinants required for size consistency. Implemented within the Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) framework, our method numerically satisfies size consistency for 4H/8H clusters, the FH dimer, and the FH--H$_2$O system. Application to intermolecular interaction energy calculations of hydrogen-bonded FH dimer and FH--H$_2$O demonstrates that our approach reproduces complete active space-configuration interaction (CAS-CI) values with errors below 0.04 kcal mol$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Measurement-only circuit of perturbed toric code on triangular lattice: Topological entanglement, 1-form symmetry and logical qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-only (quantum) circuit (MoC) gives possibility to realize the states with rich entanglements, topological orders and quantum memories. This work studies the MoC, in which the projective-measurement operators consist of stabilizers of the toric code and competitive local Pauli operators. The former correspond to terms of the toric code on a triangular lattice and the later to external magnetic and electric fields. We employ efficient numerical stabilizer algorithm to trace evolving states undergoing phase transitions. We elucidate the phase diagram of the MoC system with the observables such as, topological entanglement entropy (TEE), disorder parameters of 1-form symmetries and emergent logical operators. We clarify the locations of the phase transitions through the observation of the above quantities and obtain precise critical exponents to examine if the observables exhibit the critical behavior simultaneously under the MoC and transitions belong to the same universality class. In contrast to the TC Hamiltonian system and toric code MoC on a square lattice, the system on the triangular lattice is not self-dual nor bipartite, and then, coincidence by symmetries, such as critical behaviors across the TC and Higgs/confined phase, does not takes place. Then, the toric code MoC on the triangular lattice provides us a suitable playground to clarify the mutual relationship between the TEE, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the 1-form symmetries, and emergence of logical operators. Obtained results indicate that toric code MoC on the triangular lattice exhibits a few distinct phase transitions with different location and critical exponents, and some of them are closely related with the two-dimensional percolation transition.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking VQE Configurations: Architectures, Initializations, and Optimizers for Silicon Ground State Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising path toward precise quantum chemical simulations, particularly for systems that challenge classical methods. This work investigates the performance of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in estimating the ground-state energy of the silicon atom, a relatively heavy element that poses significant computational complexity. Within a hybrid quantum-classical optimization framework, we implement VQE using a range of ansatz, including Double Excitation Gates, ParticleConservingU2, UCCSD, and k-UpCCGSD, combined with various optimizers such as gradient descent, SPSA, and ADAM. The main contribution of this work lies in a systematic methodological exploration of how these configuration choices interact to influence VQE performance, establishing a structured benchmark for selecting optimal settings in quantum chemical simulations. Key findings show that parameter initialization plays a decisive role in the algorithm's stability, and that the combination of a chemically inspired ansatz with adaptive optimization yields superior convergence and precision compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Resource analysis of Shor's elliptic curve algorithm with an improved quantum adder on a two-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to break classical cryptographic systems by efficiently solving problems such as the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem using Shor's algorithm. While resource estimates for factoring-based cryptanalysis are well established, comparable evaluations for Shor's elliptic curve algorithm under realistic architectural constraints remain limited. In this work, we propose a carry-lookahead quantum adder that achieves Toffoli depth $\log n + \log\log n + O(1)$ with only $O(n)$ ancillas, matching state-of-the-art performance in depth while avoiding the prohibitive $O(n\log n)$ space overhead of existing approaches. Importantly, our design is naturally compatible with the two-dimensional nearest-neighbor architectures and introduce only a constant-factor overhead. Further, we perform a comprehensive resource analysis of Shor's elliptic curve algorithm on two-dimensional lattices using the improved adder. By leveraging dynamic circuit techniques with mid-circuit measurements and classically controlled operations, our construction incorporates the windowed method, Montgomery representation, and quantum tables, and substantially reduces the overhead of long-range gates. For cryptographically relevant parameters, we provide precise resource estimates. In particular, breaking the NIST P-256 curve, which underlies most modern public-key infrastructures and the security of Bitcoin, requires about $4300$ logical qubits and logical Toffoli fidelity about $10^{-9}$. These results establish new benchmarks for efficient quantum arithmetic and provide concrete guidance toward the experimental realization of Shor's elliptic curve algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spoofing resilience for simple-detection quantum illumination LIDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23228v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection and range finding using a weak light source is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks by an intruder. Quantum illumination with nonsimultaneous, phase-insensitive coincidence measurements can provide jamming resilience compared to identical measurements for classical illumination. We extend an experimentally-feasible object detection and range finding quantum illumination-based protocol to include spoofing resilience. This approach allows the system to be characterised by its experimental parameters and quantum states, rather than just its detector data. Therefore we can scope the parameter-space which provides some spoofing resilience without relying upon the prohibitive method of acquiring detector data for all combinations of the experimental parameters. We demonstrate that in certain regimes the intruder has an optimal relative detection basis angle to minimise the induced error. We also show that there are spoofing-vulnerable regimes where excessive background noise prevents any induced error, while it is still possible to perform object detection, i.e. our detectors have not been fully blinded. The sensing protocol which we describe can allow for the recognition of intrusion and the possible detection of our trustworthy return signal. Our results reinforce that quantum illumination is advantageous for spoofing resilience compared to a classical illumination-based protocol.</description>

      <title>Free-space quantum interface of a single atomic tweezer array with light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical approach for interfacing light with a two-dimensional atomic tweezer array. Typical paraxial fields are poorly matched to the array's multi-diffraction-order radiation pattern, thus severely limiting the interface coupling efficiency. Instead, we propose to design a field mode that naturally couples to the array: it consists of a unique superposition of multiple beams corresponding to the array's diffraction orders. This composite mode can be generated from a single Gaussian beam using standard free-space optics, including spatial light modulators and a single objective lens. For a triangular array with lattice spacing about twice the wavelength, all diffraction angles remain below 35 degrees, making the scheme compatible with standard objectives of numerical aperture NA &lt;= 0.7. Our analytical theory and scattering simulations reveal that the interface efficiency r0 for quantum information tasks scales favorably with the array atom number N: reaching &gt;0.99 (&gt;0.9999) for N = 149 (N approximately 1000) and scaling as 1 - r0 scales as 1/N for large N. The scheme is robust to optical imperfections and atomic-position errors, offering a viable path for quantum light-matter applications and state readout in current tweezer-array platforms.</description>

Supported by entanglement, they cannot be removed by local unitary operations, thus providing basis-independent measures, and sufficiently large values underpin the need for quantum computers in order to perform precise simulations of the system at scale. Towards a better understanding of the quantum-complexity generation by fundamental interactions, the building blocks of many-body systems, we consider non-local magic and anti-flatness in two-particle scattering processes, specifically focusing on low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering and high-energy Moller scattering. We find that the non-local magic induced in both interactions is four times the anti-flatness (which is found to be true for any two-qubit wavefunction), and verify the relation between the Clifford-averaged anti-flatness and total magic. For these processes, the anti-flatness is a more experimentally accessible quantity as it can be determined from one of the final-state particles, and does not require spin correlations. While the MOLLER experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility does not include final-state spin measurements, the results presented here may add motivation to consider their future inclusion.</description>

      <title>SQOUT: A Risk-Based Threat Analysis Framework for Quantum Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the urgent need for a cybersecurity framework tailored to quantum communication systems as the world transitions to quantum-safe infrastructures. While quantum communication promises unbreakable security, real-world deployments are vulnerable to physical, protocol, and operational risks. Our work presents a structured framework for analysing these threats, combining a TTP-style (Tactic, Technique, Procedure) approach with a specific risk assessment methodology. We introduce SQOUT, a quantum threat intelligence platform, and illustrate its application using a Photon-Number-Splitting (PNS) attack kill chain. Furthermore, we apply established international standards and best practices for information security risk management to assess quantum-specific risk scenarios, providing practical guidance for safeguarding emerging quantum infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Bound entanglement in symmetric random induced states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound entanglement, a weak -- yet resourceful -- form of quantum entanglement, remains notoriously hard to detect and construct. We address this in this paper by leveraging symmetric random induced states, where positive partial transpose (PPT) bound entanglement arises naturally under partial tracing when proper parameters are selected. We investigate the probability of finding PPT bound entanglement in symmetric random induced states constructed via two methods: partial tracing of symmetric multiqubit pure states on the one hand (MI) and tracing out a qudit ancilla on the other hand (MII). For $N &gt; 3$ qubits, we demonstrate that bound entanglement naturally emerges under optimal parameters, with a probability of occurrence very close to 1. We show that the two methods produce different varieties of PPT bound entangled states, and identify the contexts in which each method offers distinct advantages. These methods provide a versatile toolkit for the generation of large families of random PPT bound entangled states without complex numerical optimization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Classification of Rydberg Atom Systems Using Resource-Efficient Variational Quantum Circuits and Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom arrays present significant opportunities for studying many-body physics, yet distinguishing between different ordered phases without explicit order parameters remains challenging. We present a resource-efficient quantum machine learning approach combining classical shadow tomography with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) for binary phase classification of Z2 and Z3 ordered phases. Our pipeline processes 500 randomized measurements per 51-atom chain state, reconstructs shadow operators, performs PCA dimensionality reduction (514 features), and encodes features using angle embedding onto a 2-qubit parameterized circuit. The circuit employs RY-RZ angle encoding, strong entanglement via all-to-all CZ gates, and a minimal 2-parameter ansatz achieving depth 7. Training via simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) with hinge loss converged in 120 iterations. The model achieved 100% test accuracy with perfect precision, recall, and F1 scores, demonstrating that minimal quantum resources suffice for high-accuracy phase classification. This work establishes pathways for quantum-enhanced condensed matter physics on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Architecting Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Computers using Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ion (TI) qubits are a leading quantum computing platform. Current TI systems have less than 60 qubits, but a modular architecture known as the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) is a promising path to scale up devices. There is a large gap between the error rates of near-term systems ($10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) and the requirements of practical applications (below $10^{-9}$). To bridge this gap, we require Quantum Error Correction (QEC) to build \emph{logical qubits} that are composed of multiple physical qubits. While logical qubits have been demonstrated on TI qubits, these demonstrations are restricted to small codes and systems. There is no clarity on how QCCD systems should be designed to implement practical-scale QEC. This paper studies how surface codes, a standard QEC scheme, can be implemented efficiently on QCCD-based systems. To examine how architectural parameters of a QCCD system can be tuned for surface codes, we develop a near-optimal topology-aware compilation method that outperforms existing QCCD compilers by an average of 3.8X in terms of logical clock speed. We use this compiler to examine how hardware trap capacity, connectivity and electrode wiring choices can be optimised for surface code implementation. In particular, we demonstrate that small traps of two ions are surprisingly ideal from both a performance-optimal and hardware-efficiency standpoint. This result runs counter to prior intuition that larger traps (20-30 ions) would be preferable, and has the potential to inform design choices for upcoming systems.</description>

      <title>The Enigma of Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delayed-choice quantum eraser represents an interesting experiment that exemplifies Bohr's principle of complementarity in a beautiful way. According to the complementarity principle, in a two-path interference experiment, the knowledge of which path was taken by the particle and the appearance of interference are mutually exclusive. Even when the which-path information is merely retained in specific quantum path-markers, without being actually read, it suffices to eliminate interference. Nevertheless, if this path information is ``erased'' in some manner, the interference re-emerges, a phenomenon referred to as the quantum eraser. An intriguing aspect of this experiment is that if the path information is erased \emph{after} the particle has been detected on the screen, the interference still reappears, a phenomenon known as the delayed-choice quantum eraser. This observation has led to the interpretation that the particle can be influenced to exhibit characteristics of either a particle or a wave based on a decision made long after it has been registered on the screen. This idea has sparked considerable debate and discussions surrounding retrocausality. This controversy is reviewed here, and a detailed resolution provided.</description>

      <title>Variational Thermal State Preparation on Digital Quantum Processors Assisted by Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states at finite temperatures is a cornerstone of quantum computation, enabling applications in quantum simulation of many-body systems, machine learning via quantum Boltzmann machines, and optimization through thermal sampling techniques. In this work, we introduce a variational framework that leverages matrix product states for the efficient classical evaluation of the Helmholtz free energy, combining scalable entanglement entropy computation with a hardware efficient ansatz to accurately approximate thermal states in one- and two-dimensional systems. We conduct extensive benchmarking on key observables, including energy density, susceptibility, specific heat, and two-point correlations, comparing against exact analytical results for 1D systems and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for 2D lattices across various temperatures and ansatz configurations. Our large-scale numerical simulations demonstrate the capability to prepare high-quality Gibbs states for 1D lattice models with up to 30 sites and 2D systems with up to 6x6 sites, using up to 42 qubits. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor by preparing the approximate Gibbs state of a 30-site transverse-field Ising model. Leveraging a combination of error mitigation techniques, we reduce the relative errors in energy and susceptibility measurements by over 50% compared to unmitigated results.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Based Adaptive Control for Phase Stabilization in Fiber-Optic Interferometers Using Correlated Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-bin encoded photon pairs enable robust, decoherence-resistant transmission through optical fibers for long-distance quantum communication, where phase noise poses a critical limitation to stable operation. Here, we implement an adaptive Perturbation-and-Observe algorithm on a fully digital FPGA platform operating with real-time feedback at 1 Hz. The control signal is derived from the coincidence counts of correlated photon pairs. This adaptive approach reduces the rise time by 70\% and the coincidence noise by 30\%, resulting in visibility improvements sustained for more than 600 s.These results provide an efficient solution for long-term phase stabilization in quantum and photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian tomography for cold-atom simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A limitation of analog quantum simulators based on cold atoms in optical lattices is that readout is typically limited to observables diagonal in the charge basis, i.e., densities and density correlation functions. To overcome this limitation, we propose experiment-friendly schemes to measure charge-off-diagonal correlations (such as currents). Our protocols use non-interacting dynamics for random times followed by standard quantum gas microscope measurements to effectively measure in random bases. The main requirement of our scheme is the ability to turn off interactions, which can be done in many atomic species using Feshbach resonances. Importantly, our scheme requires no local control and otherwise also exhibits modest requirements in terms of total evolution time and number of repetitions. We numerically demonstrate efficient estimation of bilinear correlation functions, requiring less than $4000$ samples to measure local currents to 5% error (system-size independent) and $\sim 10^4$ samples to simultaneously measure all non-local correlations in 70-site systems. Due to its simplicity, our protocol is implementable in existing platforms and thus paves the way to precision measurements beyond particle number measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired space-time PDE solver and dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to the understanding of dynamical systems. Standard approaches involving time-stepping schemes compute the solution at each time step, which becomes too costly when simulating long-term dynamics. Alternatively, space-time methods that treat the combined space-time domain simultaneously promise better stability and accuracy. Interestingly, data-driven approaches for learning and predicting dynamics, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), also employ a combined space-time representation. However, the curse of dimensionality often limits the practical benefits of space-time methods. In this work, we investigate quantum-inspired methods for space-time approaches, both for solving PDEs and for making DMD predictions. We achieve this goal by treating both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS) encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm to make accurate long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling logarithmically in both spatial and temporal resolution. This research highlights the role of tensor networks in developing effective and interpretable models, bridging the gap between numerical methods and data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>KARIPAP: Quantum-Inspired Tensor Network Compression of Large Language Models Using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States and Tensor Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation, low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to 93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware AI architectures.</description>

      <title>Imaging magnetic flux trapping in lanthanum hydride using diamond quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanum hydride has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its signatures of superconductivity at around 250 K (1, 2). However, the megabar pressures required for synthesize and maintain its state present extraordinary challenges for experiments, particularly in characterizing its Meissner effect (3, 4). The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a promising quantum probe to address this problem (5-8), but a gap remains between its working pressure and the pressure required to study the superconducting state of lanthanum hydride (9-12). In this work, using neon gas as the pressure transmitting medium, the working pressure of NV centers is extended to nearly 200 GPa. This quantum probe is then applied to study the Meissner effect of a LaH$_{9.6}$ sample, synthesized by laser heating ammonia borane and lanthanum. A strong magnetic shielding effect is observed, with the transition temperature beginning at around 180 K and completing at 220 K. In addition, magnetic field imaging after field cooling reveals strong flux trapping and significant inhomogeneities within the sample. Our work provides compelling evidence for superconductivity in lanthanum hydride and highlights the importance of spatially resolved techniques in characterizing samples under ultrahigh pressure conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling topological phases is a central goal in quantum materials and related fields, enabling applications such as robust transport and programmable edge states. Here we uncover a mechanism in which local on-site impurities act as knobs to decompose global topological properties in discrete steps. In non-Hermitian lattices with spectral winding topology, we show that each impurity sequentially reduces the winding number by one, which is directly manifested as a stepwise decomposition of quantized plateaus in the steady-state response. Based on this principle, we further develop a scheme that sequentially induces topological edge states under impurity control, in a class of Hermitian topological systems constructed by doubling the non-Hermitian ones. Our findings reveal a general scheme to tune global topological properties with local perturbations, establishing a universal framework for impurity-controlled topological phases and offering a foundation for future exploration of reconfigurable topological phenomena across diverse physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear magnetization dynamics as a route to nonreciprocal phases, spin superfluidity, and analogue gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity kinematics.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enables Optimization of Diamond for Quantum Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spins in solid-state materials, molecules, and other chemical systems have the potential to impact the fields of quantum sensing, communication, simulation, and computing. In particular, color centers in diamond, such as negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) and silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$), are emerging as quantum platforms poised for transition to commercial devices. A key enabler stems from the semiconductor-like platform that can be tailored at the time of growth. The large growth parameter space makes it challenging to use intuition to optimize growth conditions for quantum performance. In this paper, we use supervised machine learning to train regression models using different synthesis parameters in over 100 quantum diamond samples. We train models to optimize NV$^-$ defects in diamond for high sensitivity magnetometry. Importantly, we utilize a magnetic-field sensitivity figure of merit (FOM) for NV magnetometry and use Bayesian optimization to identify critical growth parameters that lead to a 300% improvement over an average sample and a 55% improvement over the previous champion sample. Furthermore, using Shapley importance rankings, we gain new physical insights into the most impactful growth and post-processing parameters, namely electron irradiation dose, diamond seed depth relative to the plasma, seed miscut angle, and reactor nitrogen concentration. As various quantum devices can have significantly different material requirements, advanced growth techniques such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) can provide the ability to tailor material development specifically for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving resonant states for open double quantum-dot systems with spin degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study time-evolving resonant states in an open double quantum-dot system, taking into account spin degrees of freedom as well as both on-dot and interdot Coulomb interactions. We exactly derived a non-Hermite effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of two quantum dots, where the non-Hermiticity arises from an effect of infinite external leads connected to the quantum dots. By diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian, we identify four types of two-body resonant states. For the initial states of localized two electrons with opposite spins on the quantum dots, we exactly solve the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and obtain time-evolving two-body resonant states. The time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave function grows exponentially only inside a finite space interval that expands in time with electron velocity. By using the exact solution, we analyze the survival and transition probabilities of localized two electrons on the quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical behavior of confined electrons under torsion and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of torsion, Aharonov-Bohm flux, and external magnetic fields on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a confined quantum system. The confinement potential is not assumed a priori, but emerges as a radial effective potential, analogous to a quantum dot, geometrically induced by the torsion of the material. Starting from an effective radial equation derived in a nontrivial geometric background, we analytically solve for the energy spectrum and wave functions. These solutions are then employed to evaluate the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index changes, including both linear and third-order nonlinear contributions. The formalism incorporates the electric dipole approximation and accounts for intensity-dependent effects such as saturation and spectral shifts. Our results reveal that torsion and topological parameters significantly modify the optical response, leading to tunable resonances and nontrivial dispersive behavior. This work highlights the potential of geometric and topological engineering in low-dimensional systems to control and enhance nonlinear optical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Tensor gravity gradiometry with a single-axis atom gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for using a single-axis atom interferometric gravity gradiometer to measure off-diagonal elements of the gravity gradient tensor. By tilting the gradiometer, the measured gradient becomes a linear combination of different components of the gravity gradient tensor, and through multiple measurements at different tilts the separate tensor components can be inferred. We present a theoretical and numerical investigation of this technique, both for terrestrial surveys where the tilt is statically set by the user and for surveys where a strapdown sensor is dynamically tilted by the motion of the platform. We show that the gradiometer's sensitivity to the vertical gravity gradient is only slightly reduced by this method while allowing for more gradiometer information to be obtained. Major sources of error and loss of sensitivity on dynamic platforms are shown to be mitigated using an optical-gimbal technique employing commercially-available fibre-optic gyroscopes and tip-tilt mirrors.</description>

      <title>Coherent Perfect Absorption: Zero Reflection Without Linewidth Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent claims, we revisit how coherent perfect absorption (CPA) influences cavity and polaritonic linewidths. Using standard input output theory and measurements on single port bare microwave cavities and cavity magnon hybrids, we find that CPA drives the on resonance reflection to zero while the spectral width remains set by the total decay rate. Apparent narrowing observed near CPA is found to be a visual artifact that does not remain upon quantitative analysis. Extending the analysis to cavity magnomechanics, we show that logarithmic plots can exhibit apparent polaromechanical normal mode splitting, whereas linear scale spectra display no true splitting. These results clarify when CPA modifies amplitudes versus spectral poles, offer practical guidance for data presentation, and indicate that CPA alone is not a route to linewidth suppression or polaromechanical mode splitting in the linear, weak-probe regime.</description>

      <title>Suppression of quantized heat flow by the dielectric response of a compressible strip at the quantum Hall edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall (QH) edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility $\chi_q^R(k,\omega)$, we derive leading-order interaction corrections to both the edge heat flux and the plasmon spectrum. Two complementary regimes are analyzed: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, which yields a universal negative $T^4$ correction to the quantized heat flux and a corresponding convex cubic term in the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, producing a crossover from $T^4$ to $T^{3/2}$ scaling and a change of sign in the correction. The resulting backaction reduces the plasmon group velocity and can suppress the apparent thermal conductance by an amount consistent with experiment. Importantly, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit in the plasmon contribution corresponds to an induced energy flow within the compressible strip, representing a form of heat drag between chiral and nonchiral modes. The framework thus provides a microscopic and quantitatively plausible explanation of the ``missing heat flux'' anomaly observed at QH edges and links its transport signature to the nonlinearity of the plasmon spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory: from the Hamiltonian to applications in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory leads to modified gravity equations that reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view to derive the Hamiltonian associated with this theory. Focusing on isotropic spacetimes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of the GfE theory. We reveal that the FRW metrics are associated with $k$-temperature and $k$-pressure which are related to their local Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated for the case of Friedmann universes that are solutions of the GfE equations of motion in the low energy, small curvature limit. We show that while the total GQRE for unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of Friedmann universes is not decreasing in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive several new quantum bit thread prescriptions for holographic entanglement entropy, equivalent for static states to the quantum extremal surface formula. Our new prescriptions come in many varieties: vector field-based or based on measures over bulk curves, dependent or independent of the bulk UV regulator, loose and strict versions of constraints, and more. We also explore how bit threads behave in the presence of entanglement islands and baby universes. Finally, our prescriptions inspire new measures of entanglement that we call entanglement distribution functions, which can be packaged into a convex polytope that we call the entropohedron.</description>

      <title>Sensitive detection of the Rydberg transition in trapped electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. Here, we use this method to detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit in response to a pulsed-modulated microwave excitation. The result is compared with an independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of microwave-excited electrons rather than the quantum capacitance associated with their vertical displacement, as was recently reported. Our theoretical analysis based on the solution of the master equation shows that the quantum capacitance would show a response which is drastically different from what is observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Toward Krylov-based holography in double-scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the duality between Krylov complexity and geodesic length in Jackiw-Teitelboim and sine-dilaton gravity, we develop a precise holographic dictionary for quantities in the Krylov subspace of the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (DSSYK). First, we demonstrate that the growth rate of Krylov state complexity corresponds to the wormhole velocity, and show that its expectation value in coherent states serves as a boundary diagnostic of firewall-like structures via bulk reconstruction. We also delineate an alternative bulk description in terms of the proper momentum of an infalling particle at early times, establishing a threefold duality between the Krylov complexity growth rate, wormhole velocity, and proper momentum, with clear regimes of validity. Beyond the first moments, we argue that higher-order Krylov complexities capture connected bulk contributions encoded by replica wormholes, while the logarithmic variant probes the replica saddle structure. Finally, within a third-quantized setting incorporating baby universes, we show that the Krylov entropy equals the von Neumann entropy of the parent-geometry density matrix obtained after tracing out baby universes, thereby quantifying information flow into the baby universe sector. Together, these results elevate Krylov-space observables to sharp probes of bulk dynamics and topology in ensemble-averaged 2D gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to be canonical, its time evolution becomes identical to an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This finding provides strong evidence that, akin to general relativity where free particles follow geodesics, purely random processes also follow ``straight lines" defined by the geometry of information. This geometric principle is a direct consequence of the dually flat structure inherent to information geometry, originating from the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) leading to the violation of metric compatibility. Our results suggest a geometric foundation for randomness and open the door to an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.</description>

Abstract: For spin and fermionic systems in any spatial dimension, we establish that the superpolynomial decay behavior of mutual information and conditional mutual information is a universal property of gapped pure- and mixed-state phases, i.e., all systems in such a phase possess this property if one system in this phase possesses this property. We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases. As a byproduct, we sharpen the notion of mixed-state phases.</description>

Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

Abstract: Quantum coherence plays a key role in the operation and performance of quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath in a system formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to demonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the emergence of novel collective behaviors in strongly interacting systems lies at the heart of quantum many-body physics. Valuable insight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body systems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example is the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a wide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this Letter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of quantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a completely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the operator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic behavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure factor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time correlators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on matrix product states. Our results could be readily tested in state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Rabi oscillations of a monolayer quantum emitter driven through its excited state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a quantum two-level system with a resonant driving field results in the emergence of Rabi oscillations, which are the hallmark of a controlled manipulation of a quantum state on the Bloch sphere. This all-optical coherent control of solid-state two-level systems is crucial for quantum applications. In this work we study Rabi oscillations emerging in a WSe2 monolayer-based quantum dot. The emitter is driven coherently using picosecond laser pulses to a higher-energy state, while photoluminescence is probed from the ground state. The theoretical treatment based on a three-level exciton model reveals the population transfer between the exciton ground and excited states coupled by Coulomb interaction. Our calculations demonstrate that the resulting exciton ground state population can be controlled by varying driving pulse area and detuning which is evidenced by the experimental data. Our results pave the way towards the coherent control of quantum emitters in atomically thin semiconductors, a crucial ingredient for monolayer-based high-performance, on-demand single photon sources.</description>

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates. RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability, resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions. Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient approach for robust quantum sequential learning.</description>

Abstract: Quantum groups have a long and fruitful history of applications in integrable systems. Can quantum group symmetries exist in the absence of integrability? We provide an explicit example of a system with quantum group global symmetry which is chaotic. The example is a spin chain with next-to-nearest interaction term. We show the chaotic behavior of the system by studying the Eigenvalue statistics. The spin chain is non-unitary but PT-symmetric and, in addition to chaos, exhibits an interesting transition after which the eigenvalues become complex.</description>

      <title>Estimating applied potentials in cold atom lattice simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atoms in optical lattices are a versatile and highly controllable platform for quantum simulation, capable of realizing a broad family of Hubbard models, and allowing site-resolved readout via quantum gas microscopes. In principle, arbitrary site-dependent potentials can also be implemented; however, since lattice spacings are typically below the diffraction limit, precisely applying and calibrating these potentials remains challenging. Here, we propose a simple and efficient experimental protocol that can be used to measure any potential with high precision. The key ingredient in our protocol is the ability in some atomic species to turn off interactions using a Feshbach resonance, which makes the evolution easy to compute. Given this, we demonstrate that collecting snapshots from the time evolution of a known, easily prepared initial state is sufficient to accurately estimate the potential. Our protocol is robust to state preparation errors and uncertainty in the hopping rate. This paves the way toward precision quantum simulation with arbitrary potentials.</description>

      <title>Binary gravitational waves as probes of quantum graviton states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the most reliable way to reveal the quantum nature of light is through photon number statistics, since photons exhibiting sub-Poissonian statistics unambiguously demonstrate their quantum behavior. In this paper, we show that gravitons emitted by binary systems can, in principle, exhibit analogous sub-Poissonian statistics. The key idea is that the vacuum state of gravitons may not be the standard Minkowski vacuum but rather a nonclassical state imprinted with the physics of the early Universe, such as inflation. Accordingly, gravitational waves from binary systems provide a means to probe the graviton states generated in the early Universe. As a concrete example, we show that squeezed graviton states originating from inflation may be detected through the observation of gravitational waves from binary systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Computing Optimization of Complex Spin-Glass Topologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.</description>

      <title>Cost of Simulating Entanglement in Steering Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, yet certain entangled states that are unsteerable can be classically simulated in steering scenarios, making them unable to exhibit quantum steering. Despite their significance, a systematic comparison of such entangled states has not been explored. In this work, we quantify the resource content of unsteerable quantum states in terms of the amount of shared randomness required to simulate the assemblages they generate in the steering scenario. We rigorously demonstrate that the simulation cost is unbounded even for certain unsteerable two-qubit states. Moreover, the simulation cost of entangled two-qubit states is always strictly larger than that for any separable state.
  A significant portion of our results rests on the relationship between the simulation cost of two-qubit Werner states and that of noisy spin measurements. Using noisy spin measurements as our central example, we also investigate the minimum number of outcomes a parent measurement requires to simulate a given set of compatible measurements. Although certain continuous measurement families admit a finite-outcome parent measurement, we identify scenarios where the simulation cost is unbounded. Our results establish previously unknown lower bounds and upper bounds on the shared randomness simulation cost, supported by connections between the simulation cost of noisy spin measurements and various geometric inequalities, including ones from the zonotope approximation problem in Banach space theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric measures of quantum nonlocality: characterization, quantification, and comparison by distances and operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01941v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric framework for studying Bell nonlocality in Hilbert space, where, for a given quantum state, nonlocality is quantified by the distance between the state and the set of local states. This approach applies to any Bell inequality and any measurement scenario. Whenever the local set is characterized, the proposed nonlocality measure can be computed explicitly.
  As a general result, we prove that for any scenario in arbitrary dimension the closest local state to a Werner state is itself a Werner state, and analogously, the closest local state to an isotropic state is again isotropic. In the two-qubit case, we further show that the closest local state to a Bell-diagonal state is Bell-diagonal as well. These structural results are independent of the specific Bell inequality considered, thus revealing intrinsic geometric features of these families of states and providing significant simplifications for computing the proposed measures.
  For the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality in two-qubit systems and the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality for two qudits of arbitrary finite dimension, we derive explicit geometric measures of nonlocality for Bell-diagonal, Werner, and isotropic states using various distance metrics, including the trace, Hellinger, Hilbert-Schmidt distances, and relative entropy. Furthermore, we prove in all generality that for all scenarios in which the local set is not fully characterized, the geometric measures provide rigorous lower bounds on nonlocality</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a low-depth randomised algorithm for the estimation of entanglement fidelity between an $n$-qubit matchgate circuit $\mathcal{U}$ and its noisy implementation $\mathcal{E}$. Our procedure makes use of a modified Pauli-Liouville representation of quantum channels, with Clifford algebra elements as a basis. We show that this choice of representation leads to a block-diagonal compound matrix structure of matchgate superoperators which enables construction of efficient protocols for estimating the fidelity, achieving a $1/\sqrt{n}$ speedup over protocols of Flammia &amp; Liu [PRL 106, 230501]. Finally, we offer simple extensions of our protocol which (without additional overhead) benchmark matchgate circuits intertwined by Clifford circuits, and circuits composed of exclusively nearest-neighbour $XY(\theta)$ gates or Givens rotations - forming the first known method for direct benchmarking of matchgate subgroups.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes, such as subspace, subsystem, and Floquet codes, are typically constructed within the stabilizer formalism, which does not fully capture the idea of fault-tolerance needed for practical quantum computing applications. In this work, we explore the remarkably powerful formalism of detector error models, which fully captures fault-tolerance at the circuit level. We introduce the detector error model formalism in a pedagogical manner and provide several examples. Additionally, we apply the formalism to three different levels of abstraction in the engineering cycle of fault-tolerant circuit designs: finding robust syndrome extraction circuits, identifying efficient measurement schedules, and constructing fault-tolerant procedures. We enhance the surface code's resistance to measurement errors, devise short measurement schedules for color codes, and implement a more efficient fault-tolerant method for measuring logical operators.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions reveal deep insights into the behavior of many-body quantum systems, but identifying these transitions without well-defined order parameters remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to constructing phase diagrams using the vector field of the reduced fidelity susceptibility (RFS). This method maps quantum phases and formulates an optimization problem to discover observables corresponding to order parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to well-established models, including the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Interaction (ANNNI) model, a cluster state model, and a chain of Rydberg atoms. By analyzing observable decompositions into eigen-projectors and finite-size scaling, our method successfully identifies order parameters and characterizes quantum phase transitions with high precision. Our results provide a powerful tool for exploring quantum phases in systems where conventional order parameters are not readily available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a magnetic dipolar system influenced by the $z$-component of Zeeman splitting, Dzyaloshinsky--Moriya (DM) interaction, and Kaplan--Shekhtman--Entin-Wohlman--Aharony (KSEA) exchange interaction, with emphasis on the role of quantum resources in both closed and open settings. By analyzing the Gibbs thermal state and solving the Lindblad master equation, we study the behavior of quantum coherence, discord, and entanglement under thermal equilibrium and dephasing noise. After exploring these resources, we apply the model to a closed quantum battery (QB). Our results show that while Zeeman splitting degrades quantum resources in noisy and thermal regimes, it enhances QB performance by improving ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, storage capacity, and coherence during cyclic charging. The axial parameter further amplifies performance, leading to coherence saturation and persistent ergotropy growth, in line with the notion of incoherent ergotropy. KSEA interaction and the rhombic term consistently preserve coherence and entanglement under noise, thereby strengthening QB functionality. DM interaction mitigates thermal degradation of resources in the Gibbs state and improves performance, though its effect is limited under Pauli-$X$ dephasing. We reveal diverse behaviors, including increased ergotropy without coherence and the coexistence of coherence with zero extractable work. Finally, we propose Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as a feasible platform for experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha&lt;\alpha_\mathrm{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.</description>

      <title>Experimental entanglement swapping through single-photon $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In photonic quantum information processing, quantum operations using nonlinear photon-photon interactions are vital for implementing two-qubit gates and enabling faithful entanglement swapping. However, due to the weak interaction between single photons, the all-photonic realization of such quantum operations has remained out of reach so far. Herein, we demonstrate an entanglement swapping using sum-frequency generation between single photons in a $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear optical waveguide. We show that a high signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR), stable sum-frequency-generation-based entanglement heralder with an ultralow-dark-count superconducting single-photon detector can satisfy the unprecedented SNR requirement indispensable for the swapping protocol. Furthermore, the system clock is enhanced by utilizing ultrafast telecom entangled photon-pair sources that operate in the GHz range. Our results confirm a lower bound 0.770(76) for the swapped state's fidelity, surpassing the classical limit of 0.5 successfully. Our findings highlight the strong potential of broadband all-single-photonic nonlinear interactions for further sophistication in long-distance quantum communication and photonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Development of Neural Network-Based Optimal Control Pulse Generator for Quantum Logic Gates Using the GRAPE Algorithm in NMR Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a neural network to generate optimal control pulses for general single-qubit quantum logic gates, within a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) quantum computer. By utilizing a neural network, we can efficiently implement any single-qubit quantum logic gates within a reasonable time scale. The network is trained by control pulses generated by the GRAPE algorithm, all starting from the same initial point. After implementing the network, we tested it using numerical simulations. Also, we present the results of applying Neural Network-generated pulses to a three-qubit benchtop NMR system and compare them with simulation outcomes. These numerical and experimental results showcase the precision of the Neural Network-generated pulses in executing the desired dynamics. Ultimately, by developing the neural network using the GRAPE algorithm, we discover the function that maps any single-qubit gate to its corresponding pulse shape. This model enables the real-time generation of arbitrary single-qubit pulses. When combined with the GRAPE-generated pulse for the CNOT gate, it creates a comprehensive and effective set of universal gates. This set can efficiently implement any algorithm in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ era), thereby enhancing the capabilities of quantum optimal control in this domain. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other quantum computer platforms with similar Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Fermionic 2-SAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the fermionic satisfiability problem, Fermionic $k$-SAT: this is the problem of deciding whether there is a fermionic state in the null-space of a collection of fermionic, parity-conserving, projectors on $n$ fermionic modes, where each fermionic projector involves at most $k$ fermionic modes. We prove that this problem can be solved efficiently classically for $k=2$. In addition, we show that deciding whether there exists a satisfying assignment with a given fixed particle number parity can also be done efficiently classically for Fermionic 2-SAT: this problem is a quantum-fermionic extension of asking whether a classical 2-SAT problem has a solution with a given Hamming weight parity. We also prove that deciding whether there exists a satisfying assignment for particle-number-conserving Fermionic 2-SAT for some given particle number is NP-complete. Complementary to this, we show that Fermionic 9-SAT is QMA$_1$-hard.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05019v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation(QEM), an error suppression strategy without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum~(NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly been focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose a non-Markovian Noise Mitigation(NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions(BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that will make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on a spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Autonomous and Controlled Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are a rich area of research in the intersection of quantum mechanics and stochastic analysis. By considering a variety of master equations, we unify multiple views of autonomous and controlled open quantum systems and, through considering their measurement dynamics, connect them to classical linear and bilinear system identification theory. This allows us to formulate corresponding notions of quantum state identifiability for these systems which, in particular, applies to quantum state tomography, providing conditions under which the probed quantum system is reconstructible. Interestingly, the dynamical representation of the system lends itself to considering two types of identifiability: the full master equation recovery and the recovery of the corresponding system matrices of the linear and bilinear systems. Both of these concepts are discussed in detail, and conditions under which reconstruction is possible are given. We set the groundwork for a number of constructive approaches to the identification of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced L\'evy flights of quantum information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for L\'evy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Jaynes-Cummings model as an autonomous thermodynamic machine, where a qubit is driven by a cavity containing initially a large coherent field. Our analysis reveals a transition between the expected behavior of ideal-work source of the cavity at short times, and a long-time dynamics where the cavity autonomously measures the qubit and exerts a result-dependent drive. This autonomous feedback then purifies the qubit irrespective of its initial state. We show that the cavity functions thermodynamically as an autonomous Maxwell demon, trading mutual information for cooling power.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Block Encodings for Quantum Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum linear system solvers like the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) require a block encoding of the system matrix $A$ within a unitary operator $U_A$. Unfortunately, block encoding often results in significant subnormalisation and increase in the matrix's effective condition number $\kappa$, affecting the efficiency of solvers. Matrix preconditioning is a well-established classical technique to reduce $\kappa$ by multiplying $A$ by a preconditioner $P$. Here, we study quantum preconditioning for block encodings. We consider four preconditioners and two encoding approaches: (a) separately encoding $A$ and its preconditioner $P$, followed by quantum multiplication, and (b) classically multiplying $A$ and $P$ before encoding the product in $U_{PA}$. Their impact on subnormalisation factors and condition number $\kappa$ are analysed using practical matrices from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Our results show that (a) quantum multiplication introduces excessive subnormalisation factors, negating improvements in $\kappa$. We introduce preamplified quantum multiplication to reduce subnormalisation, which is of independent interest. Conversely, we see that (b) encoding of the classical product can significantly improve the effective condition number using the Sparse Approximate Inverse preconditioner with infill. Further, we introduce a new matrix filtering technique that reduces the circuit depth without adversely affecting the matrix solution. We apply these methods to reduce the number of QSVT phase factors by a factor of 25 for an example CFD matrix of size 1024x1024.</description>

      <title>Quantum matched filtering: breaking time-energy separability by 12 orders of magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of signals buried in noise is the major challenge for sensing. Classically, the optimal detector is a matched filter, whose sensitivity meets the classical limit of correlation between the filter target and the measured signal within the noise. For classical signals, the correlation is limited by the separability criterion in frequency-time. Quantum states, however are not necessarily separable, and the correlation between entangled particles can surpass the classical limits. Specifically, time-energy entangled photons can be simultaneously correlated in time difference and frequency sum with no minimum limit, potentially leading to a drastic enhancement of sensitivity for diversified sensing applications. Yet, to enjoy this quantum enhancement, a unique, global detector is needed that can recover the complete information of entanglement in a single shot, i.e. measure the combined correlated variables of time-difference and frequency-sum without measuring the individual frequencies or times. Such a global measurement could, in principle, be realized using the reverse disentangling interaction, such as sum-frequency generation (SFG), but nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level have long been prohibitively inefficient, significantly restricting practical implementations. Here we overcome this barrier: We measure simultaneously and efficiently both the frequency-sum (SFG spectrum) and the time-difference (relative group delay/dispersion) by stimulating the SFG recombination with a strong pump. We generate biphotons with extreme time-energy entanglement (octave-spanning spectrum of 113THz) and measure a relative uncertainty of time-difference and frequency-sum that violates the classical separability bound by &gt;12 orders of magnitude. Our experiment and supporting theory pave the way for quantum sensing applications, such as quantum illumination (radar).</description>

      <title>Extractors: QLDPC Architectures for Efficient Pauli-Based Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In pursuit of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation, quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been established as promising candidates for low-overhead memory when compared to conventional approaches based on surface codes. Performing fault-tolerant logical computation on QLDPC memory, however, has been a long standing challenge in theory and in practice. In this work, we propose a new primitive, which we call an $\textit{extractor system}$, that can augment any QLDPC memory into a computational block well-suited for Pauli-based computation. In particular, any logical Pauli operator supported on the memory can be fault-tolerantly measured in one logical cycle, consisting of $O(d)$ physical syndrome measurement cycles, without rearranging qubit connectivity. We further propose a fixed-connectivity, LDPC architecture built by connecting many extractor-augmented computational (EAC) blocks with bridge systems. When combined with any user-defined source of high fidelity $|T\rangle$ states, our architecture can implement universal quantum circuits via parallel logical measurements, such that all single-block Clifford gates are compiled away. The size of an extractor on an $n$ qubit code is $\tilde{O}(n)$, where the precise overhead has immense room for practical optimizations.</description>

Abstract: Based on a established relation in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral, we propose to extract the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through quantum simulation of the integrated correlation functions of trapped two-particle systems on quantum computers. The integrated correlation function can be computed by an ancilla-based algorithm proposed in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevA.64.022319}. The proposal is demonstrated with a simple contact interaction fermion model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I review and augment my work of the last few years on the physical origins and limitations of canonical quantum measurement behavior. Central to this work is a detailed analysis of the microstructure of real measurement devices. Particular attention is paid to the Mott problem, which addresses a simpler version of canonical quantum measurement behavior: It asks why an alpha particle emitted in a nuclear decay produces one and only one track in a cloud chamber. My analysis - entirely consistent with unitarity - leads to an emergent, approximate Born rule supported by experiment, with possible breakdown at very small probability density. I argue that a similar picture applies to other measurement scenarios, including Geiger counters, the Stern-Gerlach experiment and superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: Schr\"odinger cat states play an important role for applications in continuous variable quantum information technologies. As macroscopic superpositions they are inherently protected against certain types of noise making cat qubits a promising candidate for quantum computing. It has been shown recently that cat states occur naturally in driven Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) as degenerate ground states with even and odd parity that are adiabatically connected to the respective lowest two Fock states by switching off the drive. To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them. Here, we demonstrate efficient transformations of multi-mode cat states through adiabatic and diabatic switching between Kerr-type Hamiltonians with degenerate ground state manifolds. These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.</description>

Abstract: We construct examples of highly entangled two-dimensional states by exploiting a correspondence between stochastic processes in $d$ dimensions and quantum states in $d+1$ dimensions. The entanglement structure of these states, which we explicitly calculate, can be tuned between area law, sub-volume law, and volume law. This correspondence also enables a sequential generation protocol: the states can be prepared through a series of unitary transformations acting on an auxiliary system. We also discuss the conditions under which these states have local, frustration-free parent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Single-bounce quantum gravimeter to measure the free-fall of anti-hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an innovative concept for a quantum gravimeter, where atoms prepared in a Heisenberg-limited state perform a single bounce on a mirror followed by a free fall. This quantum gravimeter produces a simple and robust interference pattern which should allow to measure the free-fall acceleration of atoms. We estimate the expected accuracy of the measurement in the GBAR experiment, which aims at testing the equivalence principle on anti-hydrogen at CERN antimatter facilities. Using simulations and estimation techniques based on Cramer-Rao law and Fisher information, we show that the new quantum sensor improves the expected accuracy of the measurement. The proposal opens the door to free fall measurements on rare or exotic atomic species, especially in situations where experimental time or detection events are limited by intrinsic physical reasons.</description>

      <title>PT symmetry and the square well potential: Antilinear symmetry rather than Hermiticity in scattering processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While a Hamiltonian with a real potential acts as a Hermitian operator when it operates on bound states, it produces resonances with complex energies in a scattering experiment. The scattering states are not square integrable, being instead delta function normalized. This lack of square integrability breaks the connection between Hermiticity and real eigenvalues, to thus allow for real bound state sector eigenvalues and complex scattering sector eigenvalues. When written as contour integrals delta functions take support in the complex plane, with the scattering amplitude taking support in the complex energy plane too. However, the scattering amplitude is $CPT$ symmetric (or $PT$ symmetric if $C$ is conserved), regardless of whether or not states are square integrable. For resonance scattering this antilinear symmetry requires the presence of a complex conjugate pair of energies, one to describe the excitation of the resonance and the other to describe its decay, with it being their interplay that enforces probability conservation. Each complex pair of energy eigenvalues corresponds to only one observable resonance not two, to thus modify the standard pure decaying complex energy pole discussion of resonances. We show that the non-relativistic square-well problem with a real potential possesses $PT$ symmetry in both the bound and scattering sectors, with there being complex conjugate pairs of energy eigenvalues in the scattering sector. Despite this there is just the same number of observable resonances as in the pure decaying sector. We show that the square-well scattering threshold branch point is an exceptional point (a characteristic of antilinear symmetry) at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. The square-well potential thus provides an explicit realization of how antlinearity is more general than Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting ``gamma-matrix'' spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. However, we identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Tree-Type Photonic Cluster State Generation with Recurrent Quantum Photonic Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large, multi-dimensional clusters of entangled photons are among the most powerful resources for emerging quantum technologies, as they are predicted to enable global quantum networks or universal quantum computation. Here, we propose an entirely new architecture and protocol for their generation based on recurrent quantum photonic neural networks (QPNNs) and focusing on tree-type cluster states. Unlike other approaches, QPNN-based generators are not limited by the the coherence of quantum emitters or by probabilistic multi-photon operations, enabling arbitrary scaling only limited by loss (which, unavoidably, also affects all other methods). We show that a single QPNN can learn to perform all of the many different operations needed to create a cluster state, from photon routing to entanglement generation, all with near-perfect fidelity and at loss-limited rates, even when it is created from imperfect photonic components. Although these losses ultimately place a limit on the size of the cluster states, we show that state-of-the-art photonics should already allow for clusters of 60 photons, which can grow into the 100s with modest improvements to losses. Finally, we present an analysis of a one-way quantum repeater based on these states, determining the requisite platform quality for a global quantum network and highlighting the potential of the QPNN to play a vital role in high-impact quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are essential for the numerical study of large-scale quantum many-body systems, yet their utility has been significantly hampered by the difficulty in computing key quantities such as off-diagonal operators and entanglement. This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing a substantial advantage over conventional QMC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a promising framework for online quantum-enhanced machine learning tailored to temporal tasks, yet practical implementations with native memory capabilities remain limited. Here, we demonstrate an optical QRC platform based on deterministically generated multimode squeezed states, exploiting both spectral and temporal multiplexing in a fully continuous-variable (CV) setting, and enabling controlled fading memory. Data is encoded via programmable phase shaping of the pump in an optical parametric process and retrieved through mode-selective homodyne detection. Real-time memory is achieved through feedback using electro-optic phase modulation, while long-term dependencies are achieved via spatial multiplexing. This architecture with minimal post-processing performs nonlinear temporal tasks, including parity checking and chaotic signal forecasting, with results corroborated by a high-fidelity Digital Twin. We show that leveraging the entangled multimode structure significantly enhances the expressivity and memory capacity of the quantum reservoir. This work establishes a scalable photonic platform for quantum machine learning, operating in CV encoding and supporting practical quantum-enhanced information processing.</description>

Abstract: We employ a multiple scattering expansion to systematically derive curvature corrections to the Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction between small an-isotropic particles and general magneto-dielectric surfaces. Our results, validated against exact solutions, reveal a complex, distance-dependent interplay between material properties and surface curvature in determining stable particle orientations. We demonstrate that even small surface curvature can induce or eliminate switches in the preferred orientation, a quantum effect that is diminished by thermal fluctuations. This work provides a crucial understanding of how to engineer nano-particle orientation through tune-able parameters, offering significant implications for micro- and nano-mechanical device design.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategies for transient and equilibrium quantum thermometry using Gaussian and non-Gaussian probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study temperature estimation using quantum probes, including single-mode initial states and two-mode states generated via stimulated parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal at finite temperature. We explore both transient and equilibrium regimes and compare the performance of Gaussian and non-Gaussian probe states for temperature estimation. In the non-equilibrium regime, we show that single-mode non-Gaussian probe states - such as Fock, odd cat, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states - can significantly enhance the speed of estimation, particularly at short interaction times. In the two-mode setting, entangled states such as the two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON state, and entangled cat state can enable access to temperature information at earlier times. In the equilibrium regime, we analyze temperature estimation using two-mode squeezed thermal states, which outperform single-mode strategies. We evaluate practical measurement strategies and find that energy-based observables yield optimal precision, population difference observables provide near-optimal precision, while quadrature-based measurements are suboptimal. The precision gain arises from squeezing, which suppresses fluctuations in the population difference.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quantum sensing networks via genetic algorithms and deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optimization of graph topologies for quantum sensing networks designed to estimate weak magnetic fields. The sensors are modeled as spin systems governed by a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian in thermal equilibrium at low temperatures. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), we evolve network topologies to maximize a perturbative spectral sensitivity measure, which serves as the fitness function for the GA. For the best-performing graphs, we compute the corresponding quantum Fisher information (QFI) to assess the ultimate bounds on estimation precision. To enable efficient scaling, we use the GA-generated data to train a deep neural network, allowing extrapolation to larger graph sizes where direct computation becomes prohibitive. Our results show that while both the fitness function and QFI initially increase with system size, the QFI exhibits a clear non-monotonic behavior - saturating and eventually declining beyond a critical graph size. This reflects the loss of superlinear scaling of the QFI, as the narrowing of the energy gap signals a crossover to classical scaling of the QFI with system size. The effect is reminiscent of the microeconomic law of diminishing returns: beyond an optimal graph size, further increases yield reduced sensing performance. This saturation and decline in precision are particularly pronounced under Kac scaling, where both the QFI and spin squeezing plateau or degrade with increasing system size. We also attribute observed even-odd oscillations in the spectral sensitivity and QFI to quantum interference effects in spin phase space, as confirmed by our phase-space analysis. These findings highlight the critical role of optimizing interaction topology - rather than simply increasing network size - and demonstrate the potential of hybrid evolutionary and learning-based approaches for designing high-performance quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations with Set-Equivariant Architectures and Transfer Learning</title>

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) ans\"atze have greatly expanded the accuracy and reach of variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, in particular when exploring the manifold quantum phenomena exhibited by spin systems. However, the scalability of QMC is still compromised by several other bottlenecks, and specifically those related to the actual evaluation of observables based on random deviates that lies at the core of the approach. Here we show how the set-transformer architecture can be used to dramatically accelerate or even bypass that step, especially for time-consuming operators such as powers of the magnetization. We illustrate the procedure with a range of examples of increasing complexity, from the classical Ising model to quantum systems with long-range interactions, and comprising both regressions (to predict observables) and classifications (to detect phase transitions). Moreover, we show how transfer learning can be leveraged to reduce the training cost by reusing knowledge from different systems and smaller system sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the control protocols of quantum information devices can be simulated by assuming a low-rank ansatz for the density matrix. The rationale underlying this assumption is that quantum information protocols, by design, operate in a regime of nearly pure quantum states. Within the low-rank assumption, the simulation of these protocols is considerably faster than solving the full Lindblad master equation. This advantage can be used to increase the accuracy of the simulation by avoiding uncontrolled approximations, and to streamline protocol optimization. We benchmark our approach on the optimization of the transmon qubit dispersive readout in a realistic transmon-resonator-filter model. With Hilbert space dimension $N = 2000$, assuming a rank as low as $M = 20$ we achieve a nearly 100-fold speedup compared to full master equation integration while accurately reproducing all relevant observables. By combining the low-rank approximation with a compact pulse parametrization and gradient-free optimization, we obtain state-of-the-art readout assignment errors $\varepsilon_a \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ for a 40 ns readout pulse schedule, while comfortably running on a laptop and not relying on the rotating-wave approximation. Our approach is broadly applicable to most quantum control protocols, including quantum gates, state preparation, and fast reset operations. This establishes low-rank methods as a general tool for optimal control across diverse quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple replacement for the contested "domain-extension" in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows (Chen, 2024). As acknowledged by the author, the reported issue is due to a periodicity/support mismatch when extending only the first coordinate in the presence of offsets, which breaks the intended $\mathbb{Z}_P$-fiber. Our new subroutine replaces domain extension by a pair-shift difference that cancels unknown offsets exactly and synthesizes a uniform cyclic subgroup (a zero-offset coset) of order $P$ inside $(\mathbb{Z}_{M_2})^n$. We adopt a gate-level access model and run a short prepass that measures the designated outcome registers (Chen's Steps 1, 3, and 5), fixing $E=(y',z',h^{\ast})$. We then identify a concrete program point $t^{\star}$ at which an index wire $J \in \mathbb{Z}_P$ is preserved and the coordinate block equals $\mathbf{X}(j)\equiv 2D^2 j\,\mathbf{b}^{\ast}+\mathbf{v}^{\ast}\ (\bmod M_2)$. A compute-copy-uncompute sandwich on the prefix up to $t^{\star}$ yields a reversible evaluator that we call only on basis inputs $j=0,1$ to harvest $V=\mathbf{X}(0)$ and $\Delta=\mathbf{X}(1)-\mathbf{X}(0)\equiv 2D^2\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ within the same run. We never invert a measurement, and we do not claim the circuit suffix after $t^{\star}$. The default Step $9^{\dagger}$ uses only $\Delta$ (no foreknowledge of $\mathbf{b}^\ast$): set $\mathbf{Z}\leftarrow -\,T\cdot \Delta\ (\bmod M_2)$ for uniform $T\in\mathbb{Z}_P$ and erase $T$ coherently primewise by modular inversion and CRT.</description>

Abstract: Determining the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is essential for understanding its dynamics and validating its behavior. Hamiltonian learning provides a data-driven approach to reconstruct the generator of the dynamics from measurements on the evolved system. Among its applications, it is particularly important for benchmarking and characterizing quantum hardware, such as quantum computers and simulators. However, as these devices grow in size and complexity, this task becomes increasingly challenging. To address this, we propose a scalable and experimentally friendly Hamiltonian learning protocol for Hamiltonian operators made of local interactions. It leverages the quantum Zeno effect as a reshaping tool to localize the system's dynamics and then applies quantum process tomography to learn the coefficients of a local subset of the Hamiltonian acting on selected qubits. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require complex state preparations and uses experimentally accessible, coherence-preserving operations. We derive theoretical performance guarantees and demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol both with numerical simulations and through an experimental implementation on IBM's superconducting quantum hardware, successfully learning the coefficients of a 109-qubit Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-stabilizer resources required to achieve informational completeness in single-setting quantum state estimation scenarios. We consider fixed-basis projective measurements preceded by quantum circuits acting on $n$-qubit input states, allowing ancillary qubits to increase retrievable information. We prove that when only stabilizer resources are allowed, these strategies are always informationally equivalent to projective measurements in a stabilizer basis, and therefore never informationally complete, regardless of the number of ancillas. We then show that incorporating $T$ gates enlarges the accessible information. Specifically, we prove that at least ${2n}/{\log_2 3}$ such gates are necessary for informational completeness, and that $2n$ suffice. We conjecture that $2n$ gates are indeed both necessary and sufficient. Finally, we unveil a tight connection between entanglement structure and informational power of measurements implemented with $t$-doped Clifford circuits. Our results recast notions of ``magic'' and stabilizerness - typically framed in computational terms - into the setting of quantum metrology.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a powerful tool in solving various combinatorial problems such as Maximum Satisfiability and Maximum Cut. Hard computational problems, however, require deep circuits that place high demands on classical variational parameter optimization. Ultimately, this has necessitated investigations into alternative methods for effective QAOA parameterizations. Here, we study a parameterization scheme based on classical chaotic recursive mapping, which enables significant reductions in the scaling of the variational parameter space. Through numerical investigations of hard Maximum Satisfiability problems, we demonstrate that the chaotic mapping can effectively match the performance of standard QAOA when subject to a limited number of classical optimization iterations and short-depth circuits. Insight into this behavior is elucidated through the lens of classical dynamical systems and used to inform hybridized schemes that leverage both standard and chaotic parameterizations. It is shown that these hybridized approaches can boost QAOA performance beyond that of the standard approach alone, especially for deep circuits. Through this study, we provide a new perspective that introduces a generalized framework for specifying performant, dynamical-map-based QAOA parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Belief Propagation: Cluster-Corrected Tensor Network Contraction with Exponential Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the tensor network loop cluster expansion, introduced in arXiv:2504.07344 as a systematic correction to belief propagation, in the context of general quantum many-body problems. We provide numerical examples of the accuracy and practical applicability of the approach for the computation of ground-state observables for high bond dimension tensor networks, in two- and three-dimensions, with open and periodic boundary conditions, and for spin and fermion problems.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits to Cat-Code Qubits from Chaos-Assisted Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that chaos-assisted tunneling (CAT) imposes an intrinsic limit to the protection of Kerr-cat qubits. In the static effective description, tunneling between the quasi-degenerate cat states can be exponentially suppressed, ensuring long lifetimes. However, our Floquet analysis reveals that when the nonlinearities increase, chaotic states mediate tunneling between the cat states, producing large quasi-energy splittings. We compute tunneling rates using both full quantum simulations and semiclassical WKB theory, finding quantitative agreement and confirming that the splittings are directly linked to chaos. These results provide the first evidence of CAT in the Kerr-cat qubit and demonstrate that chaos sets a fundamental bound on the coherence of dynamically protected superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Discovery of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes Through Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction code discovery has relied on algebraic constructions with predetermined structure or computational search lacking mechanistic interpretability. We introduce a game-theoretic framework recasting code optimization as strategic interactions between competing objectives, where Nash equilibria systematically generate codes with desired properties. We validate the framework by demonstrating it rediscovers the optimal $[\![15,7,3]\!]$ quantum Hamming code (Calderbank-Shor-Steane 1996) from competing objectives without predetermined algebraic structure, with equilibrium analysis providing transparent mechanistic insights into why this topology emerges. Applied across six objectives -- distance maximization, hardware adaptation, rate-distance optimization, cluster-state generation, surface-like topologies, and connectivity enhancement -- the framework generates distinct code families through objective reconfiguration rather than algorithm redesign. Scalability to hardware-relevant sizes is demonstrated at $n=100$ qubits, discovering codes including $[\![100,50,4]\!]$ with distance-4 protection and 50\% encoding rate, with tractable $O(n^3)$ per-iteration complexity enabling discovery in under one hour. This work opens research avenues at the intersection of game theory and quantum information, providing systematic, interpretable frameworks for quantum system design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak quantum measurements enable real-time tracking and control of dynamical quantum systems, producing quantum trajectories -- evolutions of the quantum state of the system conditioned on measurement outcomes. For classical systems, the accuracy of trajectories can be improved by incorporating future information, a procedure known as smoothing. Here we apply this concept to quantum systems, generalising a formalism of quantum state smoothing for an observer monitoring a quantum system exposed to environmental decoherence, a scenario important for many quantum information protocols. This allows future data to be incorporated when reconstructing the trajectories of quantum states. We experimentally demonstrate that smoothing improves accuracy using a continuously measured nanomechanical resonator, showing that the method compensates for both gaps in the measurement record and inaccessible environments. We further observe a key predicted departure from classical smoothing: quantum noise renders the trajectories nondifferentiable. These results establish that future information can enhance quantum trajectory reconstruction, with potential applications across quantum sensing, control, and error correction.</description>

      <title>Classical theories of gravity produce entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unification of gravity and quantum mechanics remains one of the most profound open questions in science. With recent advances in quantum technology, an experimental idea first proposed by Richard Feynman is now regarded as a promising route to testing this unification for the first time. The experiment involves placing a massive object in a quantum superposition of two locations and letting it gravitationally interact with another mass. In modern versions of the experiment, if the two objects subsequently become entangled, this is considered unambiguous evidence that gravity obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This conclusion derives from theorems that treat a classical gravitational interaction as a local interaction capable of only transmitting classical, not quantum, information. Here, we argue that the classical gravitational interaction can transmit quantum information, and thus generate entanglement through physically local processes. The effects are found to scale differently to the considered quantum gravity effect, providing information on the form of the experiment required to evidence the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a metastable state decays into radiation, there must be entanglement between the radiation and the decaying system, as well as between radiation collected at late and early times. We study the interplay between these two types of entanglement in simple Gaussian models. We define, via a windowed Fourier transform, multimode quantum states associated with radiation fragments produced at different times and compute the corresponding entanglement entropy increments. On the basis of these results, we argue that such entropy increments are useful entanglement measures, especially in cases, such as Hawking radiation, where one wishes to separate the radiation into ``old'' and ``new.''</description>

Abstract: We second quantize the standard electromagnetic Lagrangian with a subsiduary Lorenz gauge constraint to obtain a covariant theory of the discrete excitations of the classical EM field that can properly be called photons. The longitudinal photon number is zero due to cancellation of Gupta-Bleuler like terms. Physical photons are described by a real number density whose spatial integral is unity so it can be interpreted as the probability density to find a photon at position x'. Energy density is not separated into is positive and negative frequency parts so the nonlocal frequency operator is not required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A core problem in communications is the optimal discrimination of binary-phase-shift-keyed (BPSK) signals. A longstanding goal has been to reach the fundamental quantum limit, known as the Helstrom bound, for BPSK signals encoded in coherent states. However, due to technical constraints, proposals for reaching the bound remain impractical. In this letter we take an alternative approach: using only Gaussian optics - displaced squeezed states and homodyne detection - we achieve discrimination of BPSK signals with error rates below what can be achieved using coherent states and any quantum measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog Hawking radiation emitted by a perfectly reflecting mirror in (1+3)-dimensional flat spacetime is investigated. This is accomplished by studying the reflected frequency and momentum based on Einstein's mirror, instead of the canonical way of solving, if possible, wave equations subjected to a dynamical Dirichlet boundary condition. In the case of a finite-size mirror, diffraction pattern appears in the radiation spectrum. Based on the relevant parameters in the proposed Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers experiment, in which the Hawking temperature $T_{H}\simeq 0.03$ eV and the mirror area $A\simeq (50\;\mu\mathrm{m})^{2}$, the Hawking photon yield is estimated to be $N\simeq 16$/laser shot.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise in Mesoscopic Hybrid Junctions: Influence of Barrier Strength and Thermal Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise is a fundamental probe of quantum transport phenomena, offering insights into current correlations and wave-particle duality. A particularly intriguing form of such noise, $\Delta_T$ noise, emerges under a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. In this work, we investigate $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, where the average charge current remains zero at zero bias. Using quantum shot noise measurements, we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions is approximately $16$ times greater than in metal-insulator-metal (NIN) counterparts. Our analysis further reveals that $\Delta_T$ noise exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on barrier strength, rising to a peak before declining, while increasing monotonically with the applied temperature bias. These findings underscore the rich interplay between thermal gradients and barrier properties in determining quantum noise characteristics in hybrid mesoscopic systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a class of one-dimensional generic spinless fermion lattice Hamiltonians that express quasi-Fermi liquid physics, manifesting both Luttinger and Fermi liquid features due to solely irrelevant interactions. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we unveil its universal structure by calculating static and dynamic responses. Key features include a finite discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the Fermi level, despite power-law singularities in the spectral function protected by particle-hole symmetry. Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a two-level system is driven on resonance by a strong incident field, its emission spectrum is characterized by the well-known Mollow triplet. If the absorption from the excited state, in this continuously driven two-level system, to a third, higher energy level, is probed by a weak field, the resulting absorption spectrum features the Autler-Townes doublet with two peaks separated by the Rabi frequency of the strong driving field. It has been shown that when the two-level system is instead driven by a periodic pulse sequence, the emission spectrum obtained has similarities with the Mollow triplet even though the system is only driven during the short application time of the pulses and is allowed to evolve freely between pulses. Here, we evaluate the absorption spectrum of the three-level system in the ladder/cascade configuration when the bottom two levels are driven by a periodic pulse sequence while the transition between the middle and the highest level is probed by a weak field. The absorption spectrum displays similarities with the Autler-Townes doublet with frequency separation between the main peaks defined by the inter-pulse delay. In addition, this spectrum shows little dependence on the pulse carrier frequency. These results demonstrate the capacity to modulate the absorption spectrum of a three-level system with experimentally achievable pulse protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and enhance it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared, going substantially beyond the previously discovered spectral equivalence. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this enhanced infrared equivalence.</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Design principles of deep translationally-symmetric neural quantum states for frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network quantum states have emerged as a leading method for studying the ground states of quantum magnets. Successful architectures exploit translational symmetry, but the root of their effectiveness and differences between architectures remain unclear. Here, we apply the ConvNext architecture, designed to incorporate elements of transformers into convolutional networks, to quantum many-body ground states. We find that it is remarkably similar to the factored vision transformer, which has been employed successfully for several frustrated spin systems, allowing us to relate this architecture to more conventional convolutional networks. Through a series of numerical experiments we design the ConvNext to achieve greatest performance at lowest computational cost, then apply this network to the Shastry-Sutherland and J1-J2 models, obtaining variational energies comparable to the state of the art, providing a blueprint for network design choices of translationally-symmetric architectures to tackle challenging ground-state problems in frustrated magnetism.</description>

      <title>Coherence, Transport, and Chaos in 1D Bose-Hubbard Model: Disorder vs. Stark Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence and phase transitions are studied in a finite one-dimensional Bose--Hubbard model using exact diagonalization under thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and disorder. The condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence are computed to characterize the Mott insulator--superfluid transition. Although finite-size effects prevent a sharp transition, ground-state properties reveal signatures of quantum criticality. Thermal fluctuations can enhance coherence via tunneling, a Stark potential promotes localization, and disorder suppresses global superfluidity while preserving local coherence. These results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature reshape coherence and offer insights for quantum simulation and strongly correlated phases. For systems up to six sites with unit filling, a spectral analysis is also performed through the metric mean gap ratio (MGR). However, limited statistics due to the small system size and computational constraints prevent a complete characterization of quantum chaos, yielding only approximate signatures.</description>

      <title>Open quantum battery in three-dimensional rotating black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charging performance of a quantum battery coupled to a scalar field in the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole. We show that for Dirichlet boundary conditions, the black hole rotation enhances the charging performance at finite times when the quantum battery's energy level spacing is smaller than the charging amplitude, whereas it degrades the charging performance in other parameter regimes. Notably, as the black hole approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates that the performance of quantum battery can probe critical properties of black holes. Additionally, regarding the energy flow in quantum battery, it is further demonstrated that the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation suppresses the quantum battery's capacity to extract this energy. Our findings not only advance the relativistic dissipation dynamics of quantum battery but also propose a novel method to detect black hole rotation and extremal-state transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

      <title>Imprints of screened dark energy on nonlocal quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics for Weakly Interacting Bosons in an Iterated High-Density Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Emergent Mixed States for Baby Universes and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of sequences of states in the large $N$ limit of AdS/CFT duality in cases in which the bulk duals involve baby universes or black holes. Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby universe.</description>

      <title>Unexpected non-universality of the time braiding phase of anyons tied by the scaling dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations, we obtain an integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the space domain.</description>
