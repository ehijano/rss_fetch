      <title>PDSim: A Shiny App for Polynomial Diffusion Model Simulation and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDSim is an R package that enables users to simulate commodity futures prices using the polynomial diffusion model introduced in Filipovic and Larsson (2016) through both a Shiny web application and R scripts. It also provides state variables and contract estimations via the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). With its user-friendly interface, PDSim makes the features of simulations and estimations accessible to all users. To date, it is the only package specifically designed for the simulation and estimation of the polynomial diffusion model. Additionally, the package integrates the Schwartz and Smith two-factor model (Schwartz &amp; Smith, 2000) as an alternative approach. PDSim offers versatile deployment options, including running locally, via the Shiny server, or through Docker.</description>

      <title>Multi-Factor Polynomial Diffusion Models and Inter-Temporal Futures Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In stochastic multi-factor commodity models, it is often the case that futures prices are explained by two latent state variables which represent the short and long term stochastic factors. In this work, we develop the family of stochastic models using polynomial diffusion to obtain the unobservable spot price to be used for modelling futures curve dynamics. The polynomial family of diffusion models allows one to incorporate a variety of non-linear, higher-order effects, into a multi-factor stochastic model, which is a generalisation of Schwartz and Smith (2000) two-factor model. Two filtering methods are used for the parameter and the latent factor estimation to address the non-linearity. We provide a comparative analysis of the performance of the estimation procedures. We discuss the parameter identification problem present in the polynomial diffusion case, regardless, the futures prices can still be estimated accurately. Moreover, we study the effects of different methods of calculating matrix exponential in the polynomial diffusion model. As the polynomial order increases, accurately and efficiently approximating the high-dimensional matrix exponential becomes essential in the polynomial diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Signal inference in financial stock return correlations through phase-ordering kinetics in the quenched regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial stock return correlations have been analyzed through the lens of random matrix theory to differentiate the underlying signal from spurious correlations. The continuous spectrum of the eigenvalue distribution derived from the stock return correlation matrix typically aligns with a rescaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution, indicating no detectable signal. In this study, we introduce a stochastic field theory model to establish a detection threshold for signals present in the limit where the eigenvalues are within the continuous spectrum, which itself closely resembles that of a random matrix where standard methods such as principal component analysis fail to infer a signal. We then apply our method to Standard &amp; Poor's 500 financial stocks' return correlations, detecting the presence of a signal in the largest eigenvalues within the continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Deep Calibration of Interest Rates Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any financial institution, it is essential to understand the behavior of interest rates. Despite the growing use of Deep Learning, for many reasons (expertise, ease of use, etc.), classic rate models such as CIR and the Gaussian family are still widely used. In this paper, we propose to calibrate the five parameters of the G2++ model using Neural Networks. Our first model is a Fully Connected Neural Network and is trained on covariances and correlations of Zero-Coupon and Forward rates. We show that covariances are more suited to the problem than correlations due to the effects of the unfeasible backpropagation phenomenon, which we analyze in this paper. The second model is a Convolutional Neural Network trained on Zero-Coupon rates with no further transformation. Our numerical tests show that our calibration based on deep learning outperforms the classic calibration method used as a benchmark. Additionally, our Deep Calibration approach is designed to be systematic. To illustrate this feature, we applied it to calibrate the popular CIR intensity model.</description>

      <title>Accounting statement analysis at industry level. A gentle introduction to the compositional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16842v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositional data are contemporarily defined as positive vectors, the ratios among whose elements are of interest to the researcher. Financial statement analysis by means of accounting ratios a.k.a. financial ratios fulfils this definition to the letter. Compositional data analysis solves the major problems in statistical analysis of standard financial ratios at industry level, such as skewness, non-normality, non-linearity, outliers, and dependence of the results on the choice of which accounting figure goes to the numerator and to the denominator of the ratio. Despite this, compositional applications to financial statement analysis are still rare. In this article, we present some transformations within compositional data analysis that are particularly useful for financial statement analysis. We show how to compute industry or sub-industry means of standard financial ratios from a compositional perspective by means of geometric means. We show how to visualise firms in an industry with a compositional principal-component-analysis biplot; how to classify them into homogeneous financial performance profiles with compositional cluster analysis; and how to introduce financial ratios as variables in a statistical model, for instance to relate financial performance and firm characteristics with compositional regression models. We show an application to the accounting statements of Spanish wineries using the decomposition of return on equity by means of DuPont analysis, and a step-by-step tutorial to the compositional freeware CoDaPack.</description>
