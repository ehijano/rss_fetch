      <title>Characterization of AF Lep b at high spectral resolution with VLT/HiRISE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the recent discovery of the directly imaged super-Jovian planet AF Lep b, several studies have been conducted to characterize its atmosphere and constrain its orbital parameters. AF Lep b has a measured dynamical mass of $3.68 \pm 0.48$ MJup, a radius of $1.3 \pm 0.15$ RJup, a nearly circular orbit in spin-orbit alignment with the host star, a relatively high metallicity, and a near-solar to super-solar C/O ratio. However, key parameters such as the rotational velocity and radial velocity could not be estimated as they require high-resolution spectroscopic data that is impossible to obtain with classical spectrographs. AF Lep b was recently observed with the new HiRISE visitor instrument at the VLT, with the goal of obtaining high-resolution (R~140,000) spectroscopic observations to better constrain the orbital and atmospheric parameters of the young giant exoplanet. We compare the extracted spectrum of AF Lep b to self-consistent atmospheric models using ForMoSA. We then use our measurements of the radial velocity of the planet to provide new constraints on the orbit of the planet. From the forward modeling, we find a C/O ratio that aligns with previous low-resolution analyses, and we confirm the super-solar metallicity. We also confirm unambiguously the presence of methane in the atmosphere of the companion. Based on all available relative astrometry and radial velocity measurements of the host star, we show that two distinct orbital populations are possible for the companion. We derive the radial velocity of AF Lep b to be $10.51 \pm 1.03$ km/s, and show that this value agrees well with one of the two orbital solutions, allowing us to rule out an entire family of orbits. Additionally, assuming that the rotation and orbit are coplanar, the derived planet's rotation rate is consistent with the observed trend of increasing spin velocity with higher planet mass.</description>

      <title>Stellar Models Also Limit Exoplanet Atmosphere Studies in Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar contamination has long been recognized as a major bottleneck in transmission spectroscopy, limiting our ability to accurately characterize exoplanet atmospheres, particularly for terrestrial worlds. In response, significant observational efforts have shifted toward emission spectroscopy as a potentially more robust alternative, exemplified by initiatives such as the 50 hour JWST "Rocky Worlds" Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) program. However, the extent to which emission spectroscopy may be affected by stellar effects remain mostly unexplored, in stark contrast with exploration and mitigation work for transmission spectroscopy. In this study, we assess the impact of imperfect knowledge of stellar spectra on exoplanet atmospheric retrievals from emission spectroscopy. For TRAPPIST-1, a 29 ppm precision on the 15 um eclipse depth is required to differentiate surface albedo with precision of 0.1 at 3 sigma confidence. Yet, we find that current 15 um eclipse depth estimations using different stellar models introduce a 40 to 80 ppm uncertainty. Moreover, such model precision should not be mistaken for a model accuracy, as we also find that JWST MIRI photometric observations of the star in-eclipse at 12.8 and 15 um, acquired with a 90 ppm 1 sigma precision, fall outside the range defined by existing models by 7 to 21 %. This lack of precision and accuracy leads to a degeneracy in retrievals of planetary albedo and impacts the search for atmospheres, effects that could be solved by acquiring the true mid-IR spectrum of the star. We therefore recommend a revised observation design for JWST secondary eclipse measurements in which mid-IR stellar spectra should be systematically acquired alongside eclipse data.</description>

      <title>Confined tumbling state as the origin of the excess of slowly rotating asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational distribution of asteroids as a function of their size is used {as a diagnostic of} their physical properties and evolution. Recent photometric surveys from the Gaia mission, allowing observation of asteroids with long spin periods (for example $\geq 24$h), found an excessive group of slow rotators and a gap separating them from faster rotators, which is unexplained by current theories. Here we developed an asteroid rotational evolution model capable of reproducing the observed distribution. {We suggest that this distribution is regulated by the competition between collisions and internal friction dampening of "tumblers" -asteroids with unstable rotation vectors, and that the slow rotator group is mainly populated by tumblers.} {We constrain the product of the rigidity and quality factor, which relates to the body's viscosity, to $\mu Q \sim 4 \times 10^9~$Pa. This number, two orders of magnitude smaller than the one assumed for monolithic boulders,} implies that {rubble pile} asteroids could have a porous structure or a thick regolith layer, and undergo stronger tidal effects.</description>

      <title>Exploring the atmosphere of GJ 1132 b with CRIRES+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a mass, radius, and mean density similar to Earth's, the rocky planet GJ 1132 b is the first truly small planet for which an atmosphere detection was proposed. If confirmed, ultra-reduced magma outgassing is the only mechanism capable of producing HCN and H$_2$O in large enough quantities to match the HST observations. The proposed atmosphere detection, however was challenged by reanalysis of the same HST data by different teams. Recent JWST observations returned ambiguous results due to the unaccounted for variability seen between two different visits. Here we report the analysis of three CRIRES+ transit observations of GJ 1132 b in order to determine the presence or absence of He I, HCN, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O in its atmosphere. We are unable to detect the presence of any of these species in the atmosphere of GJ 1132 b assuming a clear, H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, although we can place upper limits for the volume mixing ratios of CH$_4$, HCN, and H$_2$O using injections tests and atmospheric retrievals. These retrieved upper limits show the capability of CRIRES+ to detecting chemical species in rocky exoplanets, if the atmosphere is H$_2$ dominated. The detection of the atmospheres of small planets with high mean molecular weight, and the capability to distinguish between the variability introduced by stellar activity and/or the planetary atmosphere will require high-resolution spectrographs in the upcoming extremely large telescopes.</description>

      <title>TOI-6508b: A massive transiting brown dwarf orbiting a low-mass star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a low-mass star, TOI-6508b. Today, only ~50 transiting brown dwarfs have been discovered. TOI-6508b was first detected with data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in Sectors 10, 37, and 63. Ground-based follow-up photometric data were collected with the SPECULOOS-South and LCOGT-1.0m telescopes, and RV measurements were obtained with the Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) spectrograph. We find that TOI-6508b has a mass of Mp=72.5+7.6-5.1MJup and a radius of Rp=1.03+/-0.03RJup. Our modeling shows that the data are consistent with an eccentric orbit of 19day and an eccentricity of e=0.28+0.09-0.08. TOI-6508b has a mass ratio of M_BD/Ms=0.40, makes it the second highest mass ratio brown dwarf that transits a low-mass star. The host has a mass of Ms=0.174+/-0.004M_Sun, a radius of Rs=0.205+/-0.006R_Sun, an effective temperature of Teff=2930+/-70K, and a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.22+/-0.08. This makes TOI-6508b an interesting discovery that has come to light in a region still sparsely populated.</description>

      <title>High-contrast spectroscopy with the new VLT/ERIS instrument: Molecular maps and radial velocity of the gas giant AF Lep b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph (ERIS) is the new Adaptive-Optics (AO) assisted Infrared instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Its refurbished Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) SPIFFIER leverages a new AO module, enabling high-contrast imaging applications and giving access to the orbital and atmospheric characterisation of super-Jovian exoplanets. We test the detection limits of ERIS and demonstrate its scientific potential by exploring the atmospheric composition of the young super-Jovian AF Lep b and improving its orbital solution by measuring its radial velocity relative to its host star. We present new spectroscopic observations of AF Lep b in $K$-band at $R\sim 11000$ obtained with ERIS/SPIFFIER at the VLT. We reduce the data using the standard pipeline together with a custom wavelength calibration routine, and remove the stellar PSF using principal component analysis along the spectral axis. We compute molecular maps by cross-correlating the residuals with molecular spectral templates and measure the radial velocity of the planet relative to the star. Furthermore, we compute contrast grids for molecular mapping by injecting fake planets. We detect a strong signal from H$_{2}$O and CO but not from CH$_{4}$ or CO$_{2}$. This result corroborates the hypothesis of chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of AF Lep b. Our measurement of the RV of the planet yields $\Delta v_{\mathrm{R,P\star}} = 7.8 \pm 1.7$ km s$^{-1}$. This enables us to disentangle the degeneracy of the orbital solution, namely the correct longitude of the ascending node is $\Omega=248^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$ deg and the argument of periapsis is $\omega=109^{+13}_{-21}$ deg. Our results demonstrate the competitiveness of the new ERIS/SPIFFIER instrument for the orbital and atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets at high contrast and small angular separation.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of a Previous Dynamical Instability in Multi-planet M-Dwarf Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify observational signatures suggesting a history of dynamical instability in 26 out of 34 M-dwarf multi-planet systems containing no large planets. These systems may have primarily formed in a gas-rich environment, potentially hosted more planets and were more compact. We extend previous simulations of the formation of the TRAPPIST-1 system to 100 Myr to test the stability of these systems without gas. We find the absence of a strong mean motion resonance in the innermost planet pair and the absence of three body resonances throughout the system are likely to result in the merging and ejection of planets after the gas disk disperses. The runs that experience such an instability tend to produce final systems with lower multiplicities, period ratios larger than two, increased orbital spacings, higher planetary angular momentum deficits, and slightly smaller mass ratios between adjacent planets. Remarkably, we find these same trends in the observations of M-dwarf multi-planet systems containing no large planets. Our work allows us to identify specific systems that may have experienced an instability and suggests that only ~25% of these systems formed in their current observed state while most systems were likely more compact and multiplicitous earlier in time. Previous research indicates that systems that have experienced a late stage giant impact may host planets potentially more habitable than the systems that did not. With this in mind, we suggest systems around M-dwarfs that contain period ratios larger than two be given priority in the search for habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>Investigating the influence of the radiative torque disruption on the size evolution of dust in the heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a detailed study on the effect of Radiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism on the fragmentation of micrometer-sized dust grains into nanoparticles within the heliosphere. We start by estimating the disruption timescales for dust grains under various centrifugal stresses. Our numerical calculations demonstrate that RATD is a highly effective mechanism for breaking down micrometer-sized grains, producing nanoparticles more efficiently than other fragmentation processes. RATD also prevents micrometer-sized grains from being expelled by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that the location of the present water snow line depends not only on temperature but also on the size of dust grains. For smaller grains, the snow line can shift outward beyond the position defined by thermal sublimation. Furthermore, we model the size distribution of dust grains modified by the RATD mechanism using a simplified model, showing that rotational disruption significantly decreases the number density of micrometer-sized grains while substantially increasing the number density of sub-micrometer-sized grains. However, the fraction of dust grains aligned at high-$J$ attractors by radiative torques less than 80\% can considerably weaken the effect of RATD on the grain size distribution. Finally, we suggest several experiments that could potentially test the RATD mechanism and discuss the uncertainties of our model in more realistic applications to heliospheric dust.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Neutral Atmosphere Density During the Years of Increasing Solar Activity Using \textit{Insight}-HXMT Data with the Earth Occultation Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density of the Earth's middle and upper atmosphere is an important question in Earth science and is a critical factor in the design, operation, and orbital determination of low Earth orbit spacecraft. In this study, we employ the Earth Occultation Technique (EOT) combined with Maximum Likelihood Estimation to estimate the neutral atmospheric density by modeling the attenuation of X-ray photons during the occultation process of \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations of Crab Nebula. Based on 83 occultation datasets of the Crab Nebula observed by all three sets of telescopes of \textit{Insight}-HXMT between 2022 and 2024, we derived the atmospheric densities at altitudes ranging from 55\,--130\,km. We find a general agreement between our results and the prediction by the NRLMSIS model within the altitude ranges of 65\,-- 90\,km, 95\,--100\,km and 120\,--130\,km, particularly during periods of enhanced solar activity. However, we also find that the NRLMSIS model overestimates atmospheric density at altitudes 90\,--95\,km and 100\,--120\,km by approximately 20\%. Furthermore, since the atmospheric density measurements at altitudes of 55\,--\,65\,km may be subject to selection bias, we do not report the prediction accuracy of the NRLMSIS model at this altitude.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Photometric Variability in Three Young Brown Dwarfs in Taurus: Detection of Optical Flares with TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $I$-band time-series photometric variability studies of three known nearby ($\sim$ 140 pc) and young ( $\sim$ 1 Myr) brown dwarfs (BD) in the Taurus star-forming region in the Perseus Molecular Cloud. From 10 nights of observations over a time span of 10 years, with a typical run of 3 to 6 hours each night, we estimated that the BDs show unstable short-scale periodicity from 1.5 to 4.8 hours. Using the long-term photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we have conducted a time-resolved variability analysis of CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4, revealing orbital periods of $\sim$ 0.96 days and $\sim$ 3 days respectively, consistent with earlier studies. We also found two superflares in TESS sector 43 data for CFHT-BD-Tau 4 and estimated the flare energies as $7.09\times10^{35}$ erg and $3.75\times10^{36}$ erg. A magnetic field of $\sim3.39 ~kG$ is required to generate such flare energies on this BD. We performed spot modelling analysis on CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4 to address the variability detected in the data using the package BASSMAN. Spectral energy distribution and infrared colours of the sources suggest that they have a sufficient amount of circumstellar material around them.</description>

      <title>The cross-over from viscous to inertial lengthscales in rapidly-rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection is the main heat transport mechanism in the Earth's liquid core and is thought to power the dynamo that generates the geomagnetic field. Core convection is strongly constrained by rotation while being turbulent. Given the difficulty in modelling these conditions, some key properties of core convection are still debated, including the dominant energy-carrying lengthscale. Different regimes of rapidly-rotating, unmagnetised, turbulent convection exist depending on the importance of viscous and inertial forces in the dynamics, and hence different theoretical predictions for the dominant flow lengthscale have been proposed. Here we study the transition from viscously-dominated to inertia-dominated regimes using numerical simulations in spherical and planar geometries. We find that the cross-over occurs when the inertial lengthscale approximately equals the viscous lengthscale. This suggests that core convection in the absence of magnetic fields is dominated by the inertial scale, which is hundred times larger than the viscous scale.</description>

      <title>Paths to Robust Exoplanet Science Yield Margin for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will seek to detect and characterize potentially Earth-like planets around other stars. To ensure that the mission achieves the Astro2020 Decadal's recommended goal of 25 exoEarth candidates (EECs), we must take into account the probabilistic nature of exoplanet detections and provide "science margin" to budget for astrophysical uncertainties with a reasonable level of confidence. In this study, we explore the probabilistic distributions of yields to be expected from a blind exoEarth survey conducted by such a mission. We identify and estimate the impact of all major known sources of astrophysical uncertainty on the exoEarth candidate yield. As expected, eta_Earth uncertainties dominate the uncertainty in EEC yield, but we show that sampling uncertainties inherent to a blind survey are another important source of uncertainty that should be budgeted for during mission design. We adopt the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor Design B (LUVOIR-B) as a baseline and modify the telescope diameter to estimate the science margin provided by a larger telescope. We then depart from the LUVOIR-B baseline design and identify six possible design changes that, when compiled, provide large gains in exoEarth candidate yield and more than an order of magnitude reduction in exposure times for the highest priority targets. We conclude that a combination of telescope diameter increase and design improvements could provide robust exoplanet science margins for HWO.</description>

      <title>The Dynamical History of the Kepler-221 Planet System</title>

Abstract: Kepler-221 is a G-type star hosting four planets. In this system, planets b, c, and e are in (or near) a 6:3:1 three-body resonance even though the planets' period ratios show significant departures from exact two-body commensurability. Importantly, the intermediate planet d is not part of the resonance chain. To reach this resonance configuration, we propose a scenario in which there were originally five planets in the system in a chain of first-order resonances. After disk dispersal, the resonance chain became unstable and two planets quickly merged to become the current planet d. In addition, the b/c/e three-body resonance was re-established. We run N-body simulations using REBOUND to investigate the parameter space under which this scenario can operate. We find that our envisioned scenario is possible when certain conditions are met. First, the reformation of the three-body resonance after planet merging requires convergent migration between planets b and c. Second, as has previously pointed out, an efficient damping mechanism must operate to power the expansion of the b/c/e system. We find that planet d plays a crucial role during the orbital expansion phase due to destabilizing encounters of a three-body resonance between c, d, and e. A successful orbital expansion phase puts constraints on the planet properties in the Kepler-221 system including the planet mass ratios and the tidal quality factors for the planets. Our model can also be applied to other planet systems in resonance, such as Kepler-402 and K2-138.</description>

      <title>From Planetesimals to Dwarf Planets by Pebble Accretion</title>

Abstract: The size distribution of TNOs in the Kuiper Belt provides crucial insights into the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System. Recent observational surveys, including OSSOS++, have revealed that dynamically cold and hot TNO populations exhibit similar size distributions for dimmer objects ($H_r &gt; 5$), which are consistent with planetesimal formation by streaming instability (SI). However, the hot population contains a significantly larger number of massive bodies, including several dwarf planets. In this study, we investigate the role of pebble accretion in shaping the size distribution of hot TNOs, after their formation in the primordial disk (PB) between 20 and 30 au and before these bodies were dynamically implanted into their current orbits by a migrating Neptune. We find that pebble accretion grows the most massive bodies only, consistent with the flattening of the distribution brightwards of $H_r=5$. All results point to a correlation (degeneracy) between the pebble aerodynamic size and the intensity of the gas motions. Nevertheless, accretion from an inward-drifting stream of pebbles is unlikely, as it puts extreme demands on the mass budget of pebbles. In particular, the masses of the cold classicals are too low to trigger pebble accretion. Accretion in an environment where pebbles are entrained, as believed to be the case in rings seen with ALMA, is preferable. Combining the constraints obtained from this study with ALMA imagery morphology fitting reveals a typical pebble aerodynamic size of $\tau_s \sim 10^{-2}$, a turbulent diffusivity parameter $\alpha_D\sim10^{-3}$, and a total accreted pebble mass of ${\sim}10\,m_\oplus$ in the primordial belt. Those TNOs formed through significant pebble accretion with masses exceeding ${\sim}10^{-4}\,m_\oplus$ are likely to satisfy the International Astronomical Union's ``round shape'' criterion for dwarf planets.</description>

      <title>Magnetized winds of M-type stars and star-planet magnetic interactions: uncertainties and modeling strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M-type stars are the most common stars in the universe. They are ideal hosts for the search of exoplanets in the habitable zone (HZ), as their small size and low temperature make the HZ much closer in than their solar twins. Harboring very deep convective layers, they also usually exhibit very intense magnetic fields. Understanding their environment, in particular their coronal and wind properties, is thus very important, as they might be very different from what is observed in the solar system. The mass loss rate of M-type stars is poorly known observationally, and recent attempts to estimate it for some of them (TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Cen) can vary by an order of magnitude. In this work, we revisit the stellar wind properties of M-dwarfs in the light of the latest estimates of $\dot{M}$ through Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption at the astropause and slingshot prominences. We outline a modeling strategy to estimate the mass loss rate, radiative loss and wind speed, with uncertainties, based on an Alfv\'en wave driven stellar wind model. We find that it is very likely that several TRAPPIST-1 planets lie within the Alfv\'en surface, which imply that these planets experience star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI). We also find that SPMI between Proxima Cen b and its host star could be the reason of recently observed radio emissions.</description>

      <title>New Models of Jupiter's Magnetopause and Bow Shock through the Juno Prime Mission: Probabilistic Location, Shape, and Internally-driven Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction between Jupiter's magnetosphere and the solar wind is not well-constrained: while internal energetic plasma processes are thought to dominate plasma circulation, the solar wind nonetheless exerts significant control over the shape and scale of the whole structure. To better constrain this interaction, we derive new functional forms for Jupiter's magnetopause and bow shock using data from the $Ulysses$, Galileo, Cassini, and Juno missions and calibrated solar wind estimates from the Multi-Model Ensemble System for the Heliosphere (MMESH). We design an empirical Bayesian model to estimate the locations of the boundaries using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, expanding our model to sample all times, not only boundary crossing events. The boundary surfaces which best describe the data are thus estimated without the need for a full, physics-based magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) treatment of the Jovian magnetosphere and the additional assumptions required for such. The new magnetopause model exhibits significant polar flattening and dawn-dusk asymmetry, and includes a narrowing of the magnetotail when compared to previous models. The new bow shock model is largely axisymmetric. Both boundary models describe surfaces which lie closer to Jupiter than previous models, which has important implications for the modern picture of Jupiter's dynamic magnetosphere and the expected science results of current and upcoming Jupiter-bound spacecraft. Applying these models to Juno's trajectory, we estimate that the spacecraft should be expected to spend ${\sim}19\%$ of each orbit in the magnetosheath and ${\sim}4\%$ of each orbit in the solar wind starting from Perijove 64 (PJ64, 21 July 2021).</description>
