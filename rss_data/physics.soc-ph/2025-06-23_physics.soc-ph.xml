      <title>Self-organized Collapse of Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why are human societies unstable? Theories based on the observation of recurring patterns in historical data indicate that economic inequality, as well as social factors are key drivers. So far, models of this phenomenon are more macroscopic in nature. However, basic mechanisms at work could be accessible to minimal mathematical models. Here we combine a simple mechanism for economic growth with a mechanism for the spreading of social dissatisfaction. Broad wealth distributions generated by the economic mechanism eventually trigger social unrest and the destruction of wealth, leading to an emerging pattern of boom and bust. We find that the model time scales compare well with empirical data. The model emphasizes the role of broad (power law) wealth distributions for dynamical social phenomena.</description>

      <title>Triadic Novelty: A Typology and Measurement Framework for Recognizing Novel Contributions in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific progress depends on novel ideas, but current reward systems often fail to recognize them. Many existing metrics conflate novelty with popularity, privileging ideas that fit existing paradigms over those that challenge them. This study develops a theory-driven framework to better understand how different types of novelty emerge, take hold, and receive recognition. Drawing on network science and theories of discovery, we introduce a triadic typology: Pioneers, who introduce entirely new topics; Mavericks, who recombine distant concepts; and Vanguards, who reinforce weak but promising connections. We apply this typology to a dataset of 41,623 articles in the interdisciplinary field of philanthropy and nonprofit studies, linking novelty types to five-year citation counts using mixed-effects negative binomial regression. Results show that novelty is not uniformly rewarded. Pioneer efforts are foundational but often overlooked. Maverick novelty shows consistent citation benefits, particularly rewarded when it displaces prior focus. Vanguard novelty is more likely to gain recognition when it strengthens weakly connected topics, but its citation advantage diminishes as those reinforced nodes become more central. To enable fair comparison across time and domains, we introduce a simulated baseline model. These findings improve the evaluation of innovations, affecting science policy, funding, and institutional assessment practices.</description>

      <title>Xenophobia based on a few attributes can impede society's cohesiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Xenophobic interactions play a role as important as homophilic ones in shaping many dynamical processes on social networks, such as opinion formation, social balance, or epidemic spreading. In this paper, we use belief propagation and Monte Carlo simulations on tree-like signed graphs to predict that a sufficient propensity to xenophobia can impede a consensus that would otherwise emerge via a phase transition. As the strength of xenophobic interactions and the rationality of individuals with respect to social stress decrease, this transition changes from continuous to discontinuous, with a strong dependence on the initial conditions. The size of the parameter region where consensus can be reached from any initial condition decays as a power-law function of the number of discussed topics.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Network and Community Roadmap for Interconnected Autonomous Science Laboratories for Accelerated Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery is being revolutionized by AI and autonomous systems, yet current autonomous laboratories remain isolated islands unable to collaborate across institutions. We present the Autonomous Interconnected Science Lab Ecosystem (AISLE), a grassroots network transforming fragmented capabilities into a unified system that shorten the path from ideation to innovation to impact and accelerates discovery from decades to months. AISLE addresses five critical dimensions: (1) cross-institutional equipment orchestration, (2) intelligent data management with FAIR compliance, (3) AI-agent driven orchestration grounded in scientific principles, (4) interoperable agent communication interfaces, and (5) AI/ML-integrated scientific education. By connecting autonomous agents across institutional boundaries, autonomous science can unlock research spaces inaccessible to traditional approaches while democratizing cutting-edge technologies. This paradigm shift toward collaborative autonomous science promises breakthroughs in sustainable energy, materials development, and public health.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Rationality: An Evolutionary Game Theory of Perceptually Rational Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how biological organisms make decisions is of fundamental importance in understanding behavior. Such an understanding within evolutionary game theory so far has been sought by appealing to bounded rationality. Here, we present a perceptual rationality framework in the context of group cooperative interactions, where individuals make rational decisions based on their evolvable perception of the environment. We show that a simple public goods game accounts for power law distributed perceptual diversity. Incorporating the evolution of social information use into the framework reveals that rational decision-making is a natural root of the evolution of consistent personality differences and power-law distributed behavioral diversity. The behavioral diversity, core to the perceptual rationality approach, can lead to ever-shifting polymorphism or cyclic dynamics, through which different rational personality types coexist and engage in mutualistic, complementary, or competitive and exploitative relationships. This polymorphism can lead to non-monotonic evolution as external environmental conditions change. The framework provides predictions consistent with some large-scale eco-evolutionary patterns and illustrates how the evolution of social structure can modify large-scale eco-evolutionary patterns. Furthermore, consistent with most empirical evidence and in contrast to most theoretical predictions, our work suggests diversity is often detrimental to public good provision, especially in strong social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Wisdom of Crowds Through Myopic Self-Confidence Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the collective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the individual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example illustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by Galton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an ox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This phenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on independent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be significantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few influential agents.
  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess uncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world. Assume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple non-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the French-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this iterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic estimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate determined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every agent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state of the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights allocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents must then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined by the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto frontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we examine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove their convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Scientific Rankings with Breakthrough and Disruption Metrics: A Complex Network-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress is often driven by groundbreaking and disruptive research, yet traditional metrics for evaluating contributions to science often emphasize quantity over quality. In this study, we consider metrics that focus on the quality of scientific performance of countries and propose a novel framework that facilitates a competitive ranking of these countries based on their performance, highlighting the impact of their contributions. Using a bipartite network and centrality measures computed through the GENEPY scheme, we evaluate the complexity and diversity of scientific fields. The analysis incorporates two quality indicators of a research paper: the network-based normalized citation score (NBNC) to identify high-impact articles and the Disruptive Index (CD) to classify research as consolidating or disruptive. These metrics focus on the perspective of citing articles, providing a localized view of scientific influence. Our study draws on bibliometric data from OpenAlex, encompassing nearly 60 million articles in the domain of physical sciences published between 1900 and 2023. This data spans 10 fields, 89 subfields, and approximately 1,300 topics, offering a comprehensive view of scientific development over time. By focusing on quality indicators such as breakthroughs and disruptive research, our framework underscores the importance of transformative contributions that challenge existing paradigms and drive innovation. This approach not only highlights the leading contributors to global science but also reveals patterns in the evolution of scientific fields. By prioritizing impactful research, our study offers insights into optimizing resources for advancing science. The results are relevant for policymakers, funding agencies, and researchers, providing a clearer understanding of how quality-driven metrics can reshape the evaluation of scientific performance on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Models of Opinion Dynamics with Random Parametrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of the Galam model of binary opinion dynamics in which iterative discussions take place in local groups of individuals and study the effects of random deviations from the group majority. The probability of a deviation or flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. Depending on the values of the flip parameters which give the probability of a deviation, the model shows a wide variety of behaviour. We are interested in the characteristics of the model when the flip parameters are themselves randomly selected, following some probability distribution. Examples of these characteristics are whether large majorities and ties are attractors or repulsors, or the number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model. Which of the features of the model are likely to appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from features which are very rare and thus more of theoretical than practical interest. In this article, we present both exact numerical results for specific distributions of the flip parameters and small discussion groups and rigorous results in the form of limit theorems for large discussion groups. Small discussion groups model friend or work groups -- people that personally know each other and frequently spend time together. Large groups represent scenarios such as social media or political entities such as cities, states, or countries.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian Flow Analysis in High-Density Crowds: Continuity Equation with Voronoi-Based Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the beginning of the century, capturing trajectories of pedestrian streams precisely from video recordings has been possible. To enable measurements at high density, the heads of the pedestrians are marked and tracked, thus providing a complete representation of the phase space. However, classical definitions of flow, density, and velocity of pedestrian streams are based on different segments in phase space. In addition, traditional methods fail with high densities of people, as heads move even when a crowd is blocked and standing still. In this article, Voronoi decomposition is used to construct density and velocity fields from pedestrian trajectories to solve this problem. Combined with the continuity equation, a flow equation on the basis of trajectories is derived satisfying the conservation of particle numbers exactly. The proposed method allows definitions of all quantities in the same segment of phase space even on scales smaller than the dimensions of a pedestrian. It is shown that these new definitions of flow, density, velocity are consistent with classical measurements and make it possible to determine standstill in pedestrian flows even when individual body parts are moving. These properties allow to scrutinize inconsistencies in the state of the art of pedestrian fundamental diagrams.</description>

      <title>Drivers of cooperation in social dilemmas on higher-order networks</title>

Abstract: Understanding cooperation in social dilemmas requires models that capture the complexity of real-world interactions. While network frameworks have provided valuable insights to model the evolution of cooperation, they are unable to encode group interactions properly. Here, we introduce a general higher-order network framework for multi-player games on structured populations. Our model considers multi-dimensional strategies, based on the observation that social behaviours are affected by the size of the group interaction. We investigate dynamical and structural coupling between different orders of interactions, revealing the crucial role of nested multilevel interactions, and showing how such features can enhance cooperation beyond the limit of traditional models with uni-dimensional strategies. Our work identifies the key drivers promoting cooperative behaviour commonly observed in real-world group social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the dynamic structural resilience of international staple food trade networks: An entropy-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing a resilient food trade system is an international consensus on safeguarding food security amid growing disruptions. We employ an entropy-based approach to quantify the dynamic structural resilience of international trade networks for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat from 1986 to 2022. Using index decomposition analysis, we also investigate the relative contributions of several internal components to changes in resilience. Within this framework, despite heterogeneity across different food commodities, we find that current trade networks are relatively redundant, with improvements in efficiency being the dominant driver of changes in resilience. In addition, we reveal a historically pronounced impact of flow concentrations on resilience, while trade interactions have become increasingly important in recent years. Furthermore, following the leave-one-out approach, we identify critical economies and trade relationships that disproportionately affect the overall resilience, many of which are overlooked by conventional volume-based or centrality-based metrics. Moreover, we highlight that the overconcentration of flows along core trade relationships may undermine the overall efficiency and resilience, whereas peripheral trade networks play an essential role in sustaining resilience, underscoring the importance of promoting more equitable trade relations. These findings not only provide new insights for assessing the resilience of international food trade systems but also propose directions for making them more resilient.</description>

      <title>Contrail, or not contrail, that is the question: the "feasibility" of climate-optimal routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The environmental impact of aviation has been a focus of significant research for several decades. While there is a broad consensus among stakeholders on reducing carbon emissions, leading to efforts to improve route efficiency in air traffic management, the impact of non-carbon emissions like contrails has sparked a different debate. Some organizations have already moved to pre-operational trials for contrail avoidance through flight re-routing, with recent industry projects fast-tracking these operational strategies.
  This paper addresses the practical challenges of implementing contrail-aware routing. Building on our previous research, which enables the generation of wind-optimal 4D trajectories using grid-like cost functions, we utilize the TOP tool and the OpenAP aircraft performance model to analyze the trade-offs between fuel consumption and contrail avoidance. We also examine the impact of weather forecast uncertainty on contrail mitigation, the effects on airspace capacity and network operations, and the implications for aviation regulatory frameworks.
  To investigate these challenges, we reconstructed a dataset from OpenSky data, encompassing all flight trajectories over Europe on a day with significant contrail potential. Our data-driven analysis highlights the potential difficulties in implementing contrail-optimal routing in practice, particularly concerning uncertainties in weather forecasts, impacts on airspace capacity, and questions of responsibility for optimal routing.
  Overall, we argue that contrail-optimal routing should be approached with caution, as its implementation may not be as straightforward as some stakeholders suggest.</description>

      <title>The effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via preferential attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via node addition and preferential attachment. To this end, we consider a preferential-attachment-preferential-deletion (PAPD) model, in which at each time step, with probability $P_{\rm add}$ there is a growth step where an isolated node is added to the network, followed by the addition of $m$ edges, where each edge connects a node selected uniformly at random to a node selected preferentially in proportion to its degree. Alternatively, with probability $P_{\rm del}=1-P_{\rm add}$ there is a contraction step, in which a preferentially selected node is deleted and its links are erased. The balance between the growth and contraction processes is captured by the growth/contraction rate $\eta=P_{\rm add}-P_{\rm del}$. For $0 &lt; \eta \le 1$ the overall process is of network growth, while for $-1\le\eta&lt;0$ the overall process is of network contraction. Using the master equation and the generating function formalism, we study the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. It is found that for each value of $m&gt;0$ there is a critical value $\eta_c(m)=-(m-2)/(m+2)$ such that for $\eta_c(m)&lt;\eta\le1$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$. In the special case of pure growth, where $\eta=1$, the model is reduced to a preferential attachment growth model and $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits a power-law tail, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks. In contrast, for $\eta_c(m)&lt;\eta&lt;1$ the distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits an exponential tail, which has a well-defined scale.This implies a phase transition at $\eta=1$, in contrast with the preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model [B. Budnick, O. Biham and E. Katzav, J. Stat. Mech. 013401 (2025)], in which the power-law tail remains intact as long as $\eta&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Infected Smallville: How Disease Threat Shapes Sociality in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does the threat of infectious disease influence sociality among generative agents? We used generative agent-based modeling (GABM), powered by large language models, to experimentally test hypotheses about the behavioral immune system. Across three simulation runs, generative agents who read news about an infectious disease outbreak showed significantly reduced social engagement compared to agents who received no such news, including lower attendance at a social gathering, fewer visits to third places (e.g., cafe, store, park), and fewer conversations throughout the town. In interview responses, agents explicitly attributed their behavioral changes to disease-avoidance motivations. A validity check further indicated that they could distinguish between infectious and noninfectious diseases, selectively reducing social engagement only when there was a risk of infection. Our findings highlight the potential of GABM as an experimental tool for exploring complex human social dynamics at scale.</description>

      <title>Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An oligopoly is a market in which the price of a goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game. Especially, we prove that an averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in oligopoly market.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Voting Models with Varying Speeds of Correlation Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model voting behaviour in the multi-group setting of a two-tier voting system using sequences of de Finetti measures. Our model is defined by using the de Finetti representation of a probability measure (i.e. as a mixture of conditionally independent probability measures) describing voting behaviour. The de Finetti measure describes the interaction between voters and possible outside influences on them. We assume that for each population size there is a (potentially) different de Finetti measure, and as the population grows, the sequence of de Finetti measures converges weakly to the Dirac measure at the origin, representing a tendency toward weakening social cohesion as the population grows large. The resulting model covers a wide variety of behaviour, ranging from independent voting in the limit under fast convergence, a critical convergence speed with its own pattern of behaviour, to a subcritical convergence speed which yields a model in line with empirical evidence of real-world voting data, contrary to previous probabilistic models used in the study of voting. These models can be used, e.g., to study the problem of optimal voting weights in two-tier voting systems.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. These results provide strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and suggests that a tendency for intermediate melodic complexity reflects a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Noise Interplay in a Coupled Model of Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature are noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.</description>
