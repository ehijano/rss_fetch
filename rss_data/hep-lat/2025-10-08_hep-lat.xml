      <title>Phase structure analysis of 2d lattice CP(1) model with $\theta$ term using tensor renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of a two-dimensional lattice CP(1) model with a $\theta$ term. In particular, we aim to identify a critical region expected to exist along a $\theta=\pi$ line. To explore the phase structure non-perturbatively and avoid the sign problem, we employ the tensor renormalization group method. We make two improvements compared to previous tensor network studies. The first improvement involves refining the initial tensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves higher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement consists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the conformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions, which can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group method. Thanks to these improvements, we identify both the onset of the critical region, $\beta_{\rm c}=0.5952(8)$ and its universality class as the SU(2)${}_{k=1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.</description>

      <title>Non-singlet vector current in lattice QCD: $\mathrm{O}(a)$-improvement from large volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we determined the improvement coefficients $c_\mathrm{V}$ and $c_{\tilde{\mathrm{V}}}$ required for the massless $\mathrm{O}(a)$-improvement of the local and point-split discretizations of the non-singlet vector current for $N_\mathrm{f}=3$ non-perturbatively $\mathrm{O}(a)$-improved Wilson fermions and the L\"uscher-Weisz gauge action, using ensembles of large-volume configurations generated by the Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS) initiative. A new estimate for the mass-dependent improvement coefficient $\bar{b}_{\mathrm{A}}^\mathrm{eff}$ has recently become available, differing from the one used in our earlier study, and on which our implementation via a massive axial Ward identity relied. Here, we update our analysis of the mass-independent vector improvement coefficients based on the new axial current improvement coefficient, and analyse additional ensembles with a different chiral trajectory in order to validate our results at two values of the bare coupling. We find that using the new estimate of $\bar{b}_{\mathrm{A}}^\mathrm{eff}$ improves the consistency between the two chiral trajectories, as well as with a previous determination of the improvement coefficients directly in the massless limit on small volumes.</description>

      <title>Stable Evaluation of Lefschetz Thimble Intersection Numbers: Towards Real-Time Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a robust numerical method for determining intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings. Our approach employs the multiple shooting method to solve the upward flow equations from the saddle points to the original integration cycle, which also enables us to determine the signs of the intersection numbers. The method demonstrates stable and reliable performance, and has been tested for systems with up to $20$ variables, which can be further extended by adopting quadruple-precision arithmetic. We determine intersection numbers for several complex saddle points in a discretized path integral, providing new insights into the structure of real-time path integrals. The proposed method is broadly applicable to a wide range of problems involving oscillatory integrals in physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Yang-Mills matrix integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the large $N$ limit of bosonic $D$-matrix Yang-Mills integrals using two complementary bootstrap methods. In the positivity bootstrap, we obtain bounds for $\langle \text{tr}\, XX \rangle$ and $\langle \text{tr}\, XXXX \rangle$ at various length cutoff $L_{\max}$. For $D=3$, we do not find an isolated region until $L_{\max}=12$. For larger $D$, the allowed regions become islands at $L_{\max}=8$ and shrink rapidly as $L_{\max}$ increases. The precision of some $L_{\max}=12$ islands is comparable to that of Monte Carlo estimates. For a fixed $L_{\max}$, the allowed region also shrinks with $D$ and converges to the large $D$ expansion results. We further deduce the analytic expressions of various types of trajectories and eigenvalue distributions at large $D$. Based on these explicit formulas, we propose some ansatz for the analytic trajectory bootstrap and obtain accurate results for finite $D$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the equation of state of cold nuclear matter from imaginary chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sign problem in numerical calculations of the QCD Euclidean space path integral of QCD with a chemical potential vanishes if the chemical potential is imaginary and calculations of the partition function with an imaginary chemical potentials are equivalent to calculations with Lagrange multipliers enforcing the current density. At zero temperature, Lorentz boosts allows one to deduce properties of systems with both number density and and current density from properties of systems with a current density alone; this allows both upper and lower bounds to be determined for the equation of state (EOS) in the form of energy density as a function of number density.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Repurposing lattice QCD results for composite phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.08561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of proposed extensions of the Standard Model include new strongly interacting dynamics, in the form of SU(N) gauge fields coupled to various numbers of fermions. Often, these extensions allow N = 3 as a plausible choice, or even require N = 3, such as in twin Higgs models, where the new dynamics is a "copy" of QCD. However, the fermion masses in such a sector are typically different from (often heavier than) the ones of real-world QCD, relative to the confinement scale. Many of the strong interaction masses and matrix elements for SU(3) at heavy fermion masses have already been computed on the lattice, typically as a byproduct of the approach to the physical point of real QCD. We provide a summary of these relevant results for the phenomenological community.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of doubly charmed or bottom baryons to single heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decays of baryons containing double charm or double bottom quarks, focusing on their transitions to single heavy baryons through three-point QCD sum rule framework. In our calculations, we take into account nonperturbative operators with mass dimensions up to five. We calculate the form factors associated with these decays, emphasizing the vector and axial-vector transition currents in the corresponding amplitude. By applying fitting functions for the form factors based on the squared momentum transfer, we derive predictions for decay widths and branching ratios in their possible lepton channels. These findings offer valuable insights for experimentalists exploring semileptonic decays of doubly charm or bottom baryons. Perhaps they can be validated in upcoming experiments like LHCb. These investigations contribute to a deeper understanding of the decay mechanisms in these baryonic channels.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the radii of oxygen isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an {\em ab initio} study of the charge and matter radii of oxygen isotopes from $^{16}$O to $^{20}$O using nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) with high-fidelity N$^3$LO chiral interactions. To efficiently address the Monte Carlo sign problem encountered in nuclear radius calculations, we introduce the {\em partial pinhole algorithm}, significantly reducing statistical uncertainties and extending the reach to more neutron-rich and proton-rich isotopes. Our computed charge radii for $^{16}$O, $^{17}$O, and $^{18}$O closely match experimental data, and we predict a charge radius of $2.810(32)$ fm for $^{20}$O. The calculated matter radii show excellent agreement with values extracted from low-energy proton and electron elastic scattering data, but are inconsistent with those derived from interaction cross sections and charge-changing cross section measurements. These discrepancies highlight model-dependent ambiguities in the experimental extraction methods of matter radii and underscore the value of precise theoretical benchmarks from NLEFT calculations.</description>
