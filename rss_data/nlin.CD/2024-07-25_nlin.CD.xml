      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at both infinite and finite temperature, aligning with results from spectral statistics and OTOCs. Our findings offer a new diagnostic tool for quantum chaos that is operator-independent, potentially leading to more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of general properties in quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Exact and asymptotic dissipative spectral form factor for elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF) has recently emerged as a diagnostic tool for assessing non-integrability or chaos in non-Hermitian systems. It extends the concept of the spectral form factor (SFF), a widely used measure for similar investigations in Hermitian systems. In this study, we concentrate on the elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble (eGinUE), which interpolates between the non-Hermitian limit of Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) and the Hermitian limit of Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by varying a symmetry parameter. We derive exact finite-dimension expression and large-dimension approximation for the DSFF of eGinUE. A key finding of this work is a compelling ``scaling relationship" between the DSFF of eGinUE and that of the GUE or GinUE. This scaling relationship also reveals a previously unobserved connection between the DSFF of GinUE and the SFF of GUE. The DSFF for eGinUE displays a \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure in the GinUE and GUE limits, as well as in the crossover region, with differences in time scales that are well-explained by the aforementioned scaling relationship. Additionally, depending on the symmetry regime within the crossover, we provide various estimates for the Thouless time ($T_\mathrm{Th}$) and Heisenberg time ($T_\mathrm{H}$), which correspond to the dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transitions, respectively. Our analytical results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations of the eGinUE random matrix model, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Anosov Properties of a Symplectic Map with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:1703.10888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a specific symplectic map, derived from a Hamiltonian, as a model that exhibits time-reversal symmetry on a microscopic scale. Based on the analysis, any initial density function, defined almost everywhere, converges to a uniform distribution in terms of mixing (irreversible behavior) on a macroscopic level. Furthermore, we established that this mixing invariant measure is a unique equilibrium state, unique SRB measure, and physical measure. Additionally, through analytical proof, we have shown that the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, representing the average information gain per unit time is positive. This was achieved by validating the Pesin's formula and demonstrating that the critical exponent of the Lyapunov exponent is $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of all orders for Arnol'd cat map lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l&gt;2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</description>
