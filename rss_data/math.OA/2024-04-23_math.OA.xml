      <title>Faithful actions on generalized Furstenberg boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable discrete group that act minimally on a compact Hausdorff space $X$ by homeomorphisms. Our goal is to establish the equivalence between the faithfulness of the action of $G$ on the generalized Furstenberg boundary $\partial_F(G, X)$ and a weakened version of the generalized Powers' averaging property. This result provides valuable insights into the state space of the crossed product $C(X)\rtimes_{r}G$.</description>

      <title>A route to quantum computing through the theory of quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on our previous works, and in order to relate them with the theory of quantum graphs and the quantum computing principles, we once again try to introduce some newly developed technical structures just by relying on our toy example, i.e. the coordinate ring of $n\times n$ quantum matrix algebra $M_q(n)$, and the associated directed locally finite graphs $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_n)$, and the Cuntz-Krieger $C^*$-graph algebras. Meaningly, we introduce a $(4i-6)$-quantum entangled system by using the Cuntz-Krieger $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$-families associated to the $4i-6$ distinct Hamiltonian paths of $\mathcal{G}(\Pi_i)$, for $i\in\{2,\cdots,n\}$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric functionals on simply generated symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we suggest a construction of symmetric functionals on a large class of symmetric spaces over a semifinite von Neumann algebra. This approach establishes a bijection between the symmetric functionals on symmetric spaces and shift-invariant functionals on the space of bounded sequences. It allows to obtain a bijection between the classes of all continuous symmetric functionals on different symmetric spaces. Notably, we show that this mapping is not bijective on the class of all Dixmier traces. As an application of our results we prove an extension of the Connes trace formula for a wide class of operators and symmetric functionals.</description>

      <title>A note on the orbit equivalence of injective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the groupoid $C^*$-algebras associated to the transformation groupoids of injective actions of discrete countable Ore semi-groups on compact topological spaces in terms of the reduced crossed product from the dual actions, and characterise the continuous orbit equivalence for injective actions by means of the transformation groupoids, as well as their reduced groupoid $C^*$-algebras. Finally, we characterize the injective action of semi-group on its compactifications.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of matrix algebras into uniform Roe algebras and quasi-local algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer the recent problem posed by Baudier, Braga, Farah, Vignati, and Willett that asks whether the $\ell_\infty$-direct sum of the matrix algebras embeds into the uniform Roe algebra or the quasi-local algebra of a uniformly locally finite metric space. The answers are no and yes, respectively. Hence the inclusion of the uniform Roe algebra into the quasi-local algebra can be proper.</description>

      <title>A rigidity framework for Roe-like algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete solution to the problem of C*-rigidity for (extended) locally compact metric spaces. Namely, we show that (stable) isomorphisms among Roe algebras always give rise to coarse equivalences. To do so, we develop a framework to study rigidity problems for Roe-like C*-algebras of countably generated coarse spaces. This allows us to provide a unified proof of C*-rigidity for Roe algebras, algebras of operators of controlled propagation, and algebras of quasi-local operators. As further applications, we prove that the outer automorphism groups of all of these algebras are isomorphic to the group of coarse equivalences of the starting coarse space.</description>

      <title>Maximal weak Orlicz types and the strong maximal on von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{E}_n: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}_n$ and $\mathbf{E}_m: \mathcal{N} \to \mathcal{N}_m$ be two sequences of conditional expectations on finite von Neumann algebras. The optimal weak Orlicz type of the associated strong maximal operator $\mathcal{E} = (\mathbf{E}_n\otimes \mathbf{E}_m)_{n,m}$ is not yet known. In a recent work of Jose Conde and the two first-named authors, it was show that $\mathcal{E}$ has weak type $(\Phi, \Phi)$ for a family of functions including $\Phi(t) = t \, \log^{2+\varepsilon} t$, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In this article, we prove that the weak Orlicz type of $\mathcal{E}$ cannot be lowered below $L \log^2 L$, meaning that if $\mathcal{E}$ is of weak type $(\Phi, \Phi)$, then $\Phi(s) \not\in o(s \, \log^2 s)$. Our proof is based on interpolation. Namely, we use recent techniques of Cadilhac/Ricard to formulate a Marcinkiewicz type theorem for maximal weak Orlicz types. Then, we show that a weak Orlicz type lower than $L \log^2 L$ would imply a $p$-operator constant for $\mathcal{E}$ smaller than the known optimum as $p \to 1^{+}$.</description>

      <title>Definable (co)homology, pro-torus rigidity, and (co)homological classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the classical homology theory of Steenrod may be enriched with descriptive set-theoretic information. We prove that the resulting definable homology theory provides a strictly finer invariant than Steenrod homology for compact metrizable spaces up to homotopy. In particular, we show that pro-tori are completely classified up to homeomorphism by their definable homology. This is in contrast with the fact that, for example, there exist uncountably many pairwise non-homeomorphic solenoids with the same Steenrod homology groups. We similarly develop a definable cohomology theory which strengthens \v{C}ech cohomology and we show that it completely classifies complements of pro-tori up to homeomorphism.
  We also apply definable cohomology theory to the study of the space $\left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ of homotopy classes of continuous functions from a solenoid complement $X$ to the $2$-sphere, which was initiated by Borsuk and Eilenberg in 1936. It was proved by Eilenberg and Steenrod in 1940 that the space $\left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is uncountable. We will strengthen this result, by showing that each orbit of the canonical action $\mathrm{Homeo}% \left( X\right) \curvearrowright \left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is countable, and hence that such an action has uncountably many orbits. This can be seen as a rigidity result, and will be deduced from a rigidity result for definable automorphisms of the \v{C}ech cohomology of $X$. We will also show that these results still hold if one replaces solenoids with pro-tori.
  We conclude by applying the machinery developed herein to bound the Borel complexity of several well-studied classification problems in mathematics, such as that of automorphisms of continuous-trace $C^{*}$-algebras up to unitary equivalence, or that of Hermitian line bundles, up to isomorphism, over a locally compact second countable space.</description>

      <title>Rank conditions and amenability for rings associated to graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study path rings, Cohn path rings, and Leavitt path rings associated to directed graphs, with coefficients in an arbitrary ring $R$. For each of these types of rings, we stipulate conditions on the graph that are necessary and sufficient to ensure that the ring satisfies either the rank condition or the strong rank condition whenever $R$ enjoys the same property. In addition, we apply our result for path rings and the strong rank condition to characterize the graphs that give rise to amenable path algebras and exhaustively amenable path algebras.</description>
