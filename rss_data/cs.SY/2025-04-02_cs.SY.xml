      <title>Set-based state estimation of nonlinear discrete-time systems using constrained zonotopes and polyhedral relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for set-based state estimation of nonlinear discrete-time systems with bounded uncertainties. The novel method builds upon essential properties and computational advantages of constrained zonotopes (CZs) and polyhedral relaxations of factorable representations of nonlinear functions to propagate CZs through nonlinear functions, which is usually done using conservative linearization in the literature. The new method also refines the propagated enclosure using nonlinear measurements. To achieve this, a lifted polyhedral relaxation is computed for the composite nonlinear function of the system dynamics and measurement equations, in addition to incorporating the measured output through equality constraints. Polyhedral relaxations of trigonometric functions are enabled for the first time, allowing to address a broader class of nonlinear systems than our previous works. Additionally, an approach to obtain an equivalent enclosure with fewer generators and constraints is developed. Thanks to the advantages of the polyhedral enclosures based on factorable representations, the new state estimation method provides better approximations than those resulting from linearization procedures. This led to significant improvements in the computation of convex sets enclosing the system states consistent with measured outputs. Numerical examples highlight the advantages of the novel algorithm in comparison to existing CZ methods based on the Mean Value Theorem and DC programming principles.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Power Loss Identification through Physics-Based Thermal Model Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins for power electronics require accurate power losses whose direct measurements are often impractical or impossible in real-world applications. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that combines physics-based thermal modeling with data-driven techniques to identify and correct power losses accurately using only temperature measurements. Our approach leverages a cascaded architecture where a neural network learns to correct the outputs of a nominal power loss model by backpropagating through a reduced-order thermal model. We explore two neural architectures, a bootstrapped feedforward network, and a recurrent neural network, demonstrating that the bootstrapped feedforward approach achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications. Between the interconnection, we included normalization strategies and physics-guided training loss functions to preserve stability and ensure physical consistency. Experimental results show that our hybrid model reduces both temperature estimation errors (from 7.2+-6.8{\deg}C to 0.3+-0.3{\deg}C) and power loss prediction errors (from 5.4+-6.6W to 0.2+-0.3W) compared to traditional physics-based approaches, even in the presence of thermal model uncertainties. This methodology allows us to accurately estimate power losses without direct measurements, making it particularly helpful for real-time industrial applications where sensor placement is hindered by cost and physical limitations.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis of metasurface-based spatial multimode transmission for 6G wireless communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 6th generation wireless communication technology, it is important to utilize space resources efficiently. Recently, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) and meta-surface technology have attracted attention as technologies that maximize space utilization for 6G mobile communications. However, studies on HMIMO communications are still in an initial stage and its fundamental limits are yet to be unveiled. It is well known that the Fourier transform relationship can be obtained using a lens in the optical field, but research to apply it to the mobile communication field is in the early stages. In this paper, we show that the Fourier transform relationship between signals can be obtained when two metasurfaces are aligned or unaligned, and analyze the transmission and reception power, and the maximum number of spatial multimodes that can be transmitted. In addition, to reduce transmission complexity, we propose a spatial multimode transmission system using three metasurfaces and analyze signal characteristics on the meta-surfaces. In numerical results, we provide the performance of spatial multimode transmission in case of using rectangular and Gaussian signals.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Microreactor Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The economic feasibility of nuclear microreactors will depend on minimizing operating costs through advancements in autonomous control, especially when these microreactors are operating alongside other types of energy systems (e.g., renewable energy). This study explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for real-time drum control in microreactors, exploring performance in regard to load-following scenarios. By leveraging a point kinetics model with thermal and xenon feedback, we first establish a baseline using a single-output RL agent, then compare it against a traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This study demonstrates that RL controllers, including both single- and multi-agent RL (MARL) frameworks, can achieve similar or even superior load-following performance as traditional PID control across a range of load-following scenarios. In short transients, the RL agent was able to reduce the tracking error rate in comparison to PID. Over extended 300-minute load-following scenarios in which xenon feedback becomes a dominant factor, PID maintained better accuracy, but RL still remained within a 1% error margin despite being trained only on short-duration scenarios. This highlights RL's strong ability to generalize and extrapolate to longer, more complex transients, affording substantial reductions in training costs and reduced overfitting. Furthermore, when control was extended to multiple drums, MARL enabled independent drum control as well as maintained reactor symmetry constraints without sacrificing performance -- an objective that standard single-agent RL could not learn. We also found that, as increasing levels of Gaussian noise were added to the power measurements, the RL controllers were able to maintain lower error rates than PID, and to do so with less control effort.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback model predictive control under dynamic uncertainties using integral quadratic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an output-feedback tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme for linear systems under dynamic uncertainties that are described via integral quadratic constraints (IQC). By leveraging IQCs, a large class of nonlinear and dynamic uncertainties can be addressed. We leverage recent IQC synthesis tools to design a dynamic controller and an observer that are robust to these uncertainties and minimize the size of the resulting constraint tightening in the MPC. Thereby, we show that the robust estimation problem using IQCs with peak-to-peak performance can be convexified. We guarantee recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and input-to-state stability of the resulting MPC scheme.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Dynamic Cooperation of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework for coordinating heterogeneous, nonlinear multi-agent systems under individual and coupling constraints. The cooperative task is encoded as a shared objective function minimized collectively by the agents. Each agent optimizes an artificial reference as an intermediate step towards the cooperative objective, along with a control input to track it. We establish recursive feasibility, asymptotic stability, and transient performance bounds under suitable assumptions. The solution to the cooperative task is not predetermined but emerges from the optimized interactions of the agents. We demonstrate the framework on numerical examples inspired by satellite constellation control, collision-free narrow passage traversal, and coordinated quadrotor flight.</description>

      <title>Learning from Disengagements: An Analysis of Safety Driver Interventions during Remote Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates disengagements of Remote Driving Systems (RDS) based on interventions by an in-vehicle Safety Drivers (SD) in real-world Operational Design Domains (ODD) with a focus on Remote Driver (RD) performance during their driving training. Based on an analysis of over 14,000 km on remote driving data, the relationship between the driving experience of 25 RD and the frequency of disengagements is systematically investigated. The results show that the number of SD interventions decreases significantly within the first 400 km of driving experience, which illustrates a clear learning curve of the RD. In addition, the most common causes for 183 disengagements analyzed are identified and categorized, whereby four main scenarios for SD interventions were identified and illustrated. The results emphasize the need for experience-based and targeted training programs aimed at developing basic driving skills early on, thereby increasing the safety, controllability and efficiency of RDS, especially in complex urban environment ODDs.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly Surrogation for Complex Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity models are essential for accurately capturing nonlinear system dynamics. However, simulation of these models is often computationally too expensive and, due to their complexity, they are not directly suitable for analysis, control design or real-time applications. Surrogate modelling techniques seek to construct simplified representations of these systems with minimal complexity, but adequate information on the dynamics given a simulation, analysis or synthesis objective at hand. Despite the widespread availability of system linearizations and the growing computational potential of autograd methods, there is no established approach that systematically exploits them to capture the underlying global nonlinear dynamics. This work proposes a novel surrogate modelling approach that can efficiently build a global representation of the dynamics on-the-fly from local system linearizations without ever explicitly computing a model. Using radial basis function interpolation and the second fundamental theorem of calculus, the surrogate model is only computed at its evaluation, enabling rapid computation for simulation and analysis and seamless incorporation of new linearization data. The efficiency and modelling capabilities of the method are demonstrated on simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Directional excitability in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized excitable system in which spikes can happen in a continuum of directions, therefore drastically enriching the expressivity and control capability of the spiking dynamics. In this generalized excitable system, spiking trajectories happen in a Hilbert space with an excitable resting state at the origin and spike responses that can be triggered in any direction as a function of the system's state and inputs. State-dependence of the spiking direction provide the system with a vanishing spiking memory trace, which enables robust tracking and integration of inputs in the spiking direction history. The model exhibits generalized forms of both Hodgkin's Type I and Type II excitability, capturing their usual bifurcation behaviors in an abstract setting. When used as the controller of a two-dimensional navigation task, this model facilitates both the sparseness of the actuation and its sensitivity to environmental inputs. These results highlight the potential of the proposed generalized excitable model for excitable control in high- and infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Inverted Gaussian Process Optimization for Nonparametric Koopman Operator Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman Operator Theory opens the door for application of rich linear systems theory for computationally efficient modeling and optimal control of nonlinear systems by providing a globally linear representation for complex nonlinear systems. However, methodologies for Koopman Operator discovery struggle with the dependency on the set of selected observable functions and meaningful uncertainty quantification. The primary objective of this work is to leverage Gaussian process regression (GPR) to develop a probabilistic Koopman linear model while removing the need for heuristic observable specification. In this work, we present inverted Gaussian process optimization based Koopman Operator learning (iGPK), an automatic differentiation-based approach to simultaneously learn the observable-operator combination. We show that the proposed iGPK method is robust to observation noise in the training data, while also providing good uncertainty quantification, such that the predicted distribution consistently encapsulates the ground truth, even for noisy training data.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Systems Model of Feedback Optimization for Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback optimization algorithms compute inputs to a system in real time, which helps mitigate the effects of unknown disturbances. However, existing work models both system dynamics and computations in either discrete or continuous time, which does not faithfully model some applications. In this work, we model linear system dynamics in continuous time, and we model the computations of inputs in discrete time. Therefore, we present a novel hybrid systems framework for modeling feedback optimization of linear time-invariant systems that are subject to unknown, constant disturbances. For this setup, we first establish the well-posedness of the hybrid model and establish completeness of solutions while ruling out Zeno behavior. Then, our main result derives a convergence rate and an error bound for the full hybrid computation-in-theloop system and shows that it converges exponentially towards a ball of known radius about a desired fixed point. Simulation results show that this approach successfully mitigates the effects of disturbances, with the magnitude of steady-state error being 81% less than the magnitude of the disturbances in the system.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Function Synthesis for Nonlinear Systems with Dual Relative Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for synthesizing safe control actions; however, constructing CBFs remains difficult for general nonlinear systems. In this work, we provide a constructive framework for synthesizing CBFs for systems with dual relative degree -- where different inputs influence the outputs at two different orders of differentiation; this is common in systems with orientation-based actuation, such as unicycles and quadrotors. In particular, we propose dual relative degree CBFs (DRD-CBFs) and show that these DRD-CBFs can be constructively synthesized and used to guarantee system safety. Our method constructs DRD-CBFs by leveraging the dual relative degree property -- combining a CBF for an integrator chain with a Lyapunov function certifying the tracking of safe inputs generated for this linear system. We apply these results to dual relative degree systems, both in simulation and experimentally on hardware using quadruped and quadrotor robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>Interpreting and Improving Optimal Control Problems with Directional Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many robotics tasks, such as path planning or trajectory optimization, are formulated as optimal control problems (OCPs). The key to obtaining high performance lies in the design of the OCP's objective function. In practice, the objective function consists of a set of individual components that must be carefully modeled and traded off such that the OCP has the desired solution. It is often challenging to balance multiple components to achieve the desired solution and to understand, when the solution is undesired, the impact of individual cost components. In this paper, we present a framework addressing these challenges based on the concept of directional corrections. Specifically, given the solution to an OCP that is deemed undesirable, and access to an expert providing the direction of change that would increase the desirability of the solution, our method analyzes the individual cost components for their "consistency" with the provided directional correction. This information can be used to improve the OCP formulation, e.g., by increasing the weight of consistent cost components, or reducing the weight of - or even redesigning - inconsistent cost components. We also show that our framework can automatically tune parameters of the OCP to achieve consistency with a set of corrections.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Flexibility of Thermostatically Controlled Loads using Generalized Polymatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging populations of thermostatically controlled loads could provide vast storage capacity to the grid. To realize this potential, their flexibility must be accurately aggregated and represented to the system operator as a single, controllable virtual device. Mathematically this is computed by calculating the Minkowski sum of the individual flexibility of each of the devices. Previous work showed how to exactly characterize the flexibility of lossless storage devices as generalized polymatroids-a family of polytope that enable an efficient computation of the Minkowski sum. In this paper we build on these results to encompass devices with dissipative storage dynamics. In doing so we are able to provide tractable methods of accurately characterizing the flexibility in populations consisting of a variety of heterogeneous devices. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed characterizations are tight.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-Based Pinning Control Strategy for Enhanced Synchronization in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is essential for the stability and coordinated operation of complex networked systems. Pinning control, which selectively controls a subset of nodes, provides a scalable solution to enhance network synchronizability. However, existing strategies face key limitations: heuristic centrality-based methods lack a direct connection to synchronization dynamics, while spectral approaches, though effective, are computationally intensive. To address these challenges, we propose a perturbation-based optimized strategy (PBO) that dynamically evaluates each node's spectral impact on the Laplacian matrix, achieving improved synchronizability with significantly reduced computational costs (with complexity O(kM)). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional strategies in synchronizability, convergence rate, and pinning robustness to node failures. Notably, in all the empirical networks tested and some generated networks, PBO significantly outperforms the brute-force greedy strategy, demonstrating its ability to avoid local optima and adapt to complex connectivity patterns. Our study establishes the theoretical relationship between network synchronizability and convergence rate, offering new insights into efficient synchronization strategies for large-scale complex networks.</description>

      <title>Carbon and Reliability-Aware Computing for Heterogeneous Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of data centers (DCs) has intensified energy and carbon footprint, incurring a massive environmental computing cost. While carbon-aware workload migration strategies have been examined, existing approaches often overlook reliability metrics such as server lifetime degradation, and quality-of-service (QoS) that substantially affects both carbon and operational efficiency of DCs. Hence, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization framework for spatio-temporal workload migration across distributed DCs that jointly minimizes operational and embodied carbon emissions while complying with service-level agreements (SLA). A key contribution is the development of an embodied carbon emission model based on servers' expected lifetime analysis, which explicitly considers server heterogeneity resulting from aging and utilization conditions. These issues are accommodated using new server dispatch strategies, and backup resource allocation model, accounting hardware, software and workload-induced failure. The overall model is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization problem with multiple linearization techniques to ensure computational tractability. Numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed method reduces total carbon emissions by up to 21%, offering a pragmatic approach to sustainable DC operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an observer design framework for ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems based on various types of existing or even novel one-parameter symmetries (exact, asymptotic and variational) ending up with a certain number of semi-global and global observers, with bounded or unbounded system's solutions and with infinite- or finite-time convergence. We compare some of these symmetry-based observers with existing observers, recovering for instance the same performances of high-gain semiglobal observers and the finite-time convergence capabilities of sliding mode observers, while obtaining novel global observers where existing techniques are not able to provide any.</description>

      <title>New Insights into the Decidability of Opacity in Timed Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the decidability of opacity in timed automata (TA), a property that has been proven to be undecidable in general. First, we address a theoretical gap in recent work by J. An et al. (FM 2024) by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the decidability of location-based opacity in TA. Based on these conditions, we identify a new decidable subclass of TA, called timed automata with integer resets (IRTA), where clock resets are restricted to occurring at integer time points. We also present a verification algorithm for opacity in IRTA. On the other hand, we consider achieving decidable timed opacity by weakening the capabilities of intruders. Specifically, we show that opacity in general TA becomes decidable under the assumption that intruders can only observe time in discrete units. These results establish theoretical foundations for modeling timed systems and intruders in security analysis, enabling an effective balance between expressiveness and decidability.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically safe and efficient model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes tackling safety-critical stochastic Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks with a samplebased, model-based approach. At the core of the method lies a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that acts as function approximation, providing a model-based predictive control policy. To ensure safety, a probabilistic Control Barrier Function (CBF) is integrated into the MPC controller. A sample-based approach with guarantees is employed to approximate the effects of stochasticies in the optimal control formulation and to guarantee the probabilistic CBF condition. A learnable terminal cost formulation is included in the MPC objective to counterbalance the additional computational burden due to sampling. An RL algorithm is deployed to learn both the terminal cost and the CBF constraint. Results from our numerical experiment on a constrained LTI problem corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in reducing computation time while preserving control performance and safety.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pricing for Optimal Coordination in Networked Energy Systems with Nonsmooth Cost Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incentive-based coordination mechanisms for distributed energy consumption have shown promise in aligning individual user objectives with social welfare, especially under privacy constraints. Our prior work proposed a two-timescale adaptive pricing framework, where users respond to prices by minimizing their local cost, and the system operator iteratively updates the prices based on aggregate user responses. A key assumption was that the system cost need to smoothly depend on the aggregate of the user demands. In this paper, we relax this assumption by considering the more realistic model of where the cost are determined by solving a DCOPF problem with constraints. We present a generalization of the pricing update rule that leverages the generalized gradients of the system cost function, which may be nonsmooth due to the structure of DCOPF. We prove that the resulting dynamic system converges to a unique equilibrium, which solves the social welfare optimization problem. Our theoretical results provide guarantees on convergence and stability using tools from nonsmooth analysis and Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations on networked energy systems illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning for Zero-Shot Speed Estimation of BLDC motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate speed estimation in sensorless brushless DC motors is essential for high-performance control and monitoring, yet conventional model-based approaches struggle with system nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties. In this work, we propose an in-context learning framework leveraging transformer-based models to perform zero-shot speed estimation using only electrical measurements. By training the filter offline on simulated motor trajectories, we enable real-time inference on unseen real motors without retraining, eliminating the need for explicit system identification while retaining adaptability to varying operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional Kalman filter-based estimators, especially in low-speed regimes that are crucial during motor startup.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Model Predictive Control of Charging Energy Hubs with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an online energy management system for an energy hub where electric vehicles are charged combining on-site photovoltaic generation and battery energy storage with the power grid, with the objective to decide on the battery (dis)charging to minimize the costs of operation. To this end, we devise a scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (MPC) scheme that leverages probabilistic 24-hour-ahead forecasts of charging load, solar generation and day-ahead electricity prices to achieve a cost-optimal operation of the energy hub. The probabilistic forecasts leverage conformal prediction providing calibrated distribution-free confidence intervals starting from a machine learning model that generates no uncertainty quantification. We showcase our controller by running it over a 280-day evaluation in a closed-loop simulated environment to compare the observed cost of two scenario-based MPCs with two deterministic alternatives: a version with point forecast and a version with perfect forecast. Our results indicate that, compared to the perfect forecast implementation, our proposed scenario-based MPCs are 11\% more expensive, and 1\% better than their deterministic point-forecast counterpart.</description>

      <title>Intermodal Network of Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand and Micromobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies models for Autonomous Micromobility-on-Demand (AMoD), a paradigm in which a fleet of autonomous vehicles delivers mobility services on demand in conjunction with micromobility systems. Specifically, we introduce a network flow model to encapsulate the interaction between AMoD and micromobility under an intermodal connection scenario. The primary objective is to analyze the system's behavior, optimizing passenger travel time. Following this theoretical development, we apply these models to the transportation networks of Sioux Falls, enabling a quantifiable evaluation of the reciprocal influences between the two transportation modes. We found that increasing the number of vehicles in any of these two modes of transportation also incentivizes users to use the other. Moreover, increasing the rebalancing capacity of the micromobility system will make the AMoD system need less rebalancing.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for robust dynamic metabolic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metabolic control can enhance bioprocess flexibility and expand the available optimization degrees of freedom via real-time modulation of metabolic enzyme expression. This allows target metabolic fluxes to be dynamically tuned throughout the process. However, identifying optimal dynamic control policies is challenging due to the presence of potential metabolic burden, cytotoxic effects, and the generally high-dimensional solution space, making exhaustive experimentation impractical. Here, we propose an approach based on reinforcement learning to derive optimal dynamic metabolic control policies by allowing an agent or controller to interact with a surrogate dynamic model $\textit{in silico}$. To incorporate and test robustness, we apply domain randomization, enabling the controller to generalize across system uncertainties. Our approach provides an alternative to conventional model-based control such as model predictive control, which requires differentiating the models with respect to decision variables; an often impractical task when dealing with complex stochastic, nonlinear, stiff, or piecewise-defined dynamics. In contrast, our approach only requires forward integration, making the task computationally much simpler with off-the-shelf solvers. We demonstrate our approach with a case study on the dynamic control of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ for fatty acid biosynthesis. The derived dynamic metabolic control policies outperform static control, achieving up to 40 % higher titers while remaining robust under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Semi-Data-Driven Model Predictive Control: A Physics-Informed Data-Driven Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) has emerged as a powerful technique to control complex systems without the need for extensive modeling efforts. However, relying solely on offline collected data trajectories to represent the system dynamics introduces certain drawbacks. Therefore, we present a novel semi-data-driven model predictive control (SD-MPC) framework that combines (limited) model information with DeePC to address a range of these drawbacks, including sensitivity to noisy data, lack of robustness, and a high computational burden. In this work we focus on the performance of DeePC in operating regimes not captured by the offline collected data trajectories and demonstrate how incorporating an underlying parametric model can counteract this issue. SD-MPC exhibits equivalent closed-loop performance as DeePC for deterministic linear time-invariant systems. Simulations demonstrate the general control performance of the proposed SD-MPC for both a linear time-invariant system and a nonlinear system modeled as a linear parameter-varying system. These results provide numerical evidence of the enhanced robustness of SD-MPC over classical DeePC.</description>

      <title>Boosting the transient performance of reference tracking controllers with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference tracking is a key objective in many control systems, including those characterized by complex nonlinear dynamics. In these settings, traditional control approaches can effectively ensure steady-state accuracy but often struggle to explicitly optimize transient performance. Neural network controllers have gained popularity due to their adaptability to nonlinearities and disturbances; however, they often lack formal closed-loop stability and performance guarantees. To address these challenges, a recently proposed neural-network control framework known as Performance Boosting (PB) has demonstrated the ability to maintain $\mathcal{L}_p$ stability properties of nonlinear systems while optimizing generic transient costs.
  This paper extends the PB approach to reference tracking problems. First, we characterize the complete set of nonlinear controllers that preserve desired tracking properties for nonlinear systems equipped with base reference-tracking controllers. Then, we show how to optimize transient costs while searching within subsets of tracking controllers that incorporate expressive neural network models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of our method to uncertainties in the underlying system dynamics. Numerical simulations on a robotic system demonstrate the advantages of our approach over the standard PB framework.</description>

      <title>Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient update policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning for building performance simulation-A review of a nascent field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building performance simulation (BPS) is critical for understanding building dynamics and behavior, analyzing performance of the built environment, optimizing energy efficiency, improving demand flexibility, and enhancing building resilience. However, conducting BPS is not trivial. Traditional BPS relies on an accurate building energy model, mostly physics-based, which depends heavily on detailed building information, expert knowledge, and case-by-case model calibrations, thereby significantly limiting their scalability. With the development of sensing technology and increased data availability, there is a growing attention and interest in data-driven BPS. However, purely data-driven models often suffer from limited generalization ability and a lack of physical consistency, resulting in poor performance in real-world applications. To address these limitations, recent studies have started to incorporate physics priors into data-driven models, a methodology called physics-informed machine learning (PIML). PIML is an emerging field with the definitions, methodologies, evaluation criteria, application scenarios, and future directions that remain open. To bridge those gaps, this study systematically reviews the state-of-art PIML for BPS, offering a comprehensive definition of PIML, and comparing it to traditional BPS approaches regarding data requirements, modeling effort, performance and computation cost. We also summarize the commonly used methodologies, validation approaches, application domains, available data sources, open-source packages and testbeds. In addition, this study provides a general guideline for selecting appropriate PIML models based on BPS applications. Finally, this study identifies key challenges and outlines future research directions, providing a solid foundation and valuable insights to advance R&amp;D of PIML in BPS.</description>

      <title>Analyzing cell-to-cell heterogeneities and cell configurations in parallel-connected battery modules using physics-based modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In parallel-connected cells, cell-to-cell (CtC) heterogeneities can lead to current and thermal gradients that may adversely impact the battery performance and aging. Sources of CtC heterogeneity include manufacturing process tolerances, poor module configurations, and inadequate thermal management. Understanding which CtC heterogeneity sources most significantly impact battery performance is crucial, as it can provide valuable insights. In this study, we use an experimentally validated electrochemical battery model to simulate hundreds of battery configurations, each consisting of four cells in parallel. We conduct a statistical analysis to evaluate the relative importance of key cell-level parameters, interconnection resistance, cell spacing, and location on performance and aging. The analysis reveals that heterogeneities in electrode active material volume fractions primarily impact module capacity, energy, and cell current, leading to substantial thermal gradients. However, to fully capture the output behavior, interconnection resistance, state of charge gradients and the effect of the temperature on parameter values must also be considered. Additionally, module design configurations, particularly cell location, exacerbate thermal gradients, accelerating long-term module degradation. This study also offers insights into optimizing cell arrangement during module design to reduce thermal gradients and enhance overall battery performance and longevity. Simulation results with four cells indicate a reduction of 51.8% in thermal gradients, leading to a 5.2% decrease in long-term energy loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To obtain explainable guarantees in the online synthesis of optimal controllers for high-integrity cyber-physical systems, we re-investigate the use of exhaustive search as an alternative to reinforcement learning. Approach: We model an application scenario as a hybrid game automaton, enabling the synthesis of robustly correct and near-optimal controllers online without prior training. For modal synthesis, we employ discretised games solved via scope-adaptive and step-pre-shielded discrete dynamic programming. Evaluation: In a simulation-based experiment, we apply our approach to an autonomous aerial vehicle scenario. Contribution: We propose a parametric system model and a parametric online synthesis.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Safety Verification using Barrier Certificates and Matrix Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a critical challenge, especially when system models are difficult to obtain or cannot be fully trusted due to uncertainty, modeling errors, or environmental disturbances. Traditional model-based approaches rely on precise system dynamics, which may not be available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a data-driven safety verification framework that leverages matrix zonotopes and barrier certificates to verify system safety directly from noisy data. Instead of trusting a single unreliable model, we construct a set of models that capture all possible system dynamics that align with the observed data, ensuring that the true system model is always contained within this set. This model set is compactly represented using matrix zonotopes, enabling efficient computation and propagation of uncertainty. By integrating this representation into a barrier certificate framework, we establish rigorous safety guarantees without requiring an explicit system model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in verifying safety for dynamical systems with unknown models, showcasing its potential for real-world CPS applications.</description>

      <title>SACA: A Scenario-Aware Collision Avoidance Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Integrating LLMs-Driven Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable collision avoidance under extreme situations remains a critical challenge for autonomous vehicles. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, their application in safety-critical evasive maneuvers is limited by latency and robustness issues. Even so, LLMs stand out for their ability to weigh emotional, legal, and ethical factors, enabling socially responsible and context-aware collision avoidance. This paper proposes a scenario-aware collision avoidance (SACA) framework for extreme situations by integrating predictive scenario evaluation, data-driven reasoning, and scenario-preview-based deployment to improve collision avoidance decision-making. SACA consists of three key components. First, a predictive scenario analysis module utilizes obstacle reachability analysis and motion intention prediction to construct a comprehensive situational prompt. Second, an online reasoning module refines decision-making by leveraging prior collision avoidance knowledge and fine-tuning with scenario data. Third, an offline evaluation module assesses performance and stores scenarios in a memory bank. Additionally, A precomputed policy method improves deployability by previewing scenarios and retrieving or reasoning policies based on similarity and confidence levels. Real-vehicle tests show that, compared with baseline methods, SACA effectively reduces collision losses in extreme high-risk scenarios and lowers false triggering under complex conditions.

      <title>Robust Control of General Linear Delay Systems under Dissipativity Part I: A KSD based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an effective framework for designing memoryless dissipative full-state feedbacks for general linear delay systems via the Krasovski\u{i} functional (KF) approach, where an unlimited number of pointwise and general distributed delays (DDs) exists in the state, input and output. To handle the infinite dimensionality of DDs, we employ the Kronecker-Seuret Decomposition (KSD) which we recently proposed for analyzing matrix-valued functions in the context of delay systems. The KSD enables factorization or least-squares approximation of any number of $\fL^2$ DD kernel from any number of DDs without introducing conservatism. This also facilitates the construction of a complete-type KF with flexible integral kernels, following from an application of a novel integral inequalities derived from the least-squares principle. Our solution includes two theorems and an iterative algorithm to compute controller gains without relying on nonlinear solvers. A challenging numerical example, intractable for existing methods, underscores the efficacy of this approach.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Classical Spectrum Estimators for $L$-mixing Time-series Data with Unknown Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral estimation is an important tool in time series analysis, with applications including economics, astronomy, and climatology. The asymptotic theory for non-parametric estimation is well-known but the development of non-asymptotic theory is still ongoing. Our recent work obtained the first non-asymptotic error bounds on the Bartlett and Welch methods for $L$-mixing stochastic processes. The class of $L$-mixing processes contains common models in time series analysis, including autoregressive processes and measurements of geometrically ergodic Markov chains. Our prior analysis assumes that the process has zero mean. While zero-mean assumptions are common, real-world time-series data often has unknown, non-zero mean. In this work, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds for both Bartlett and Welch estimators for $L$-mixing time-series data with unknown means. The obtained error bounds are of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$, where $k$ is the number of data segments used in the algorithm, which are tighter than our previous results under the zero-mean assumption.</description>

      <title>System Identification from Partial Observations under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the partially observed linear system identification, where the goal is to obtain reasonably accurate estimation of the balanced truncation of the true system up to the order $k$ from output measurements. We consider the challenging case of system identification under adversarial attacks, where the probability of having an attack at each time is $\Theta(1/k)$ while the value of the attack is arbitrary. We first show that the $l_1$-norm estimator exactly identifies the true Markov parameter matrix for nilpotent systems under any type of attack. We then build on this result to extend it to general systems and show that the estimation error exponentially decays as $k$ grows. The estimated balanced truncation model accordingly shows an exponentially decaying error for the identification of the true system up to the similarity transformation. This work is the first to provide the input-output analysis of the system with partial observations under arbitrary attacks.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Algorithm to Symbolically Derive Generalized n-Trailer Vehicle Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Articulated multi-axle vehicles are interesting from a control-theoretic perspective due to their peculiar kinematic offtracking characteristics, instability modes, and singularities. Holonomic and nonholonomic constraints affecting the kinematic behavior is investigated in order to develop control-oriented kinematic models representative of these peculiarities. Then, the structure of these constraints is exploited to develop an iterative algorithm to symbolically derive yaw-plane kinematic models of generalized $n$-trailer articulated vehicles with an arbitrary number of multi-axle vehicle units. A formal proof is provided for the maximum number of kinematic controls admissible to a large-scale generalized articulated vehicle system, which leads to a generalized Ackermann steering law for $n$-trailer systems. Moreover, kinematic data collected from a test vehicle is used to validate the kinematic models and, to understand the rearward yaw rate amplification behavior of the vehicle pulling multiple simulated trailers.</description>

      <title>Integrated LLM-Based Intrusion Detection with Secure Slicing xApp for Securing O-RAN-Enabled Wireless Network Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is reshaping telecommunications by promoting openness, flexibility, and intelligent closed-loop optimization. By decoupling hardware and software and enabling multi-vendor deployments, O-RAN reduces costs, enhances performance, and allows rapid adaptation to new technologies. A key innovation is intelligent network slicing, which partitions networks into isolated slices tailored for specific use cases or quality of service requirements. The RAN Intelligent Controller further optimizes resource allocation, ensuring efficient utilization and improved service quality for user equipment (UEs). However, the modular and dynamic nature of O-RAN expands the threat surface, necessitating advanced security measures to maintain network integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Intrusion detection systems have become essential for identifying and mitigating attacks. This research explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate security recommendations based on the temporal traffic patterns of connected UEs. The paper introduces an LLM-driven intrusion detection framework and demonstrates its efficacy through experimental deployments, comparing non fine-tuned and fine-tuned models for task-specific accuracy.</description>

      <title>Robust Continuous-Time Generation Scheduling under Power Demand Uncertainty: An Affine Decision Rule Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing generation scheduling models for power systems under demand uncertainty rely on energy-based formulations with a finite number of time periods, which may fail to ensure that power supply and demand are balanced continuously over time. To address this issue, we propose a robust generation scheduling model in a continuous-time framework, employing a decision rule approach. First, for a given set of demand trajectories, we formulate a general robust generation scheduling problem to determine a decision rule that maps these demand trajectories and time points to the power outputs of generators. Subsequently, we derive a surrogate of it as our model by carefully designing a class of decision rules that are affine in the current demand, with coefficients invariant over time and constant terms that are continuous piecewise affine functions of time. As a result, our model can be recast as a finite-dimensional linear program to determine the coefficients and the function values of the constant terms at each breakpoint, solvable via the cutting-plane method. Our model is non-anticipative unlike most existing continuous-time models, which use Bernstein polynomials, making it more practical. We also provide illustrative numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Egocentric Conformal Prediction for Safe and Efficient Navigation in Dynamic Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) has emerged as a powerful tool in robotics and control, thanks to its ability to calibrate complex, data-driven models with formal guarantees. However, in robot navigation tasks, existing CP-based methods often decouple prediction from control, evaluating models without considering whether prediction errors actually compromise safety. Consequently, ego-vehicles may become overly conservative or even immobilized when all potential trajectories appear infeasible. To address this issue, we propose a novel CP-based navigation framework that responds exclusively to safety-critical prediction errors. Our approach introduces egocentric score functions that quantify how much closer obstacles are to a candidate vehicle position than anticipated. These score functions are then integrated into a model predictive control scheme, wherein each candidate state is individually evaluated for safety. Combined with an adaptive CP mechanism, our framework dynamically adjusts to changes in obstacle motion without resorting to unnecessary conservatism. Theoretical analyses indicate that our method outperforms existing CP-based approaches in terms of cost-efficiency while maintaining the desired safety levels, as further validated through experiments on real-world datasets featuring densely populated pedestrian environments.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Approximate Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Motion Cueing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCAs) encode the movement of simulated vehicles into movement that can be reproduced with a motion simulator to provide a realistic driving experience within the capabilities of the machine. This paper introduces a novel learning-based MCA for serial robot-based motion simulators. Building on the differentiable predictive control framework, the proposed method merges the advantages of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) - notably nonlinear constraint handling and accurate kinematic modeling - with the computational efficiency of machine learning. By shifting the computational burden to offline training, the new algorithm enables real-time operation at high control rates, thus overcoming the key challenge associated with NMPC-based motion cueing. The proposed MCA incorporates a nonlinear joint-space plant model and a policy network trained to mimic NMPC behavior while accounting for joint acceleration, velocity, and position limits. Simulation experiments across multiple motion cueing scenarios showed that the proposed algorithm performed on par with a state-of-the-art NMPC-based alternative in terms of motion cueing quality as quantified by the RMSE and correlation coefficient with respect to reference signals. However, the proposed algorithm was on average 400 times faster than the NMPC baseline. In addition, the algorithm successfully generalized to unseen operating conditions, including motion cueing scenarios on a different vehicle and real-time physics-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Contextualized Autonomous Drone Navigation using LLMs Deployed in Edge-Cloud Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation is usually trained offline in diverse scenarios and fine-tuned online subject to real-world experiences. However, the real world is dynamic and changeable, and many environmental encounters/effects are not accounted for in real-time due to difficulties in describing them within offline training data or hard to describe even in online scenarios. However, we know that the human operator can describe these dynamic environmental encounters through natural language, adding semantic context. The research is to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform real-time contextual code adjustment to autonomous navigation. The challenge not evaluated in literature is what LLMs are appropriate and where should these computationally heavy algorithms sit in the computation-communication edge-cloud computing architectures. In this paper, we evaluate how different LLMs can adjust both the navigation map parameters dynamically (e.g., contour map shaping) and also derive navigation task instruction sets. We then evaluate which LLMs are most suitable and where they should sit in future edge-cloud of 6G telecommunication architectures.</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of an Intention-Aware Probabilistic Framework for Trajectory Prediction: Integrating COLREGS, Grounding Hazards, and Planned Routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision avoidance capability is an essential component in an autonomous vessel navigation system. To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of research on a class of methods called feedback optimization. These are methods to steer the state of a control system to an equilibrium that arises as the solution of an optimization problem. Despite the growing literature on the topic, the important problem of enforcing state constraints at all times remains unaddressed. In this work, we present the first feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints. The method combines a class of dynamics called safe gradient flows with high-order control barrier functions. We provide a number of results on our proposed controller, including well-posedness guarantees, anytime constraint-satisfaction guarantees, equivalence between the closed-loop's equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points, and local asymptotic stability of optima.</description>

      <title>Time-optimal Convexified Reeds-Shepp Paths on a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses time-optimal path planning for a vehicle capable of moving both forward and backward on a unit sphere with a unit maximum speed, and constrained by a maximum absolute turning rate $U_{max}$. The proposed formulation can be utilized for optimal attitude control of underactuated satellites, optimal motion planning for spherical rolling robots, and optimal path planning for mobile robots on spherical surfaces or uneven terrains. By utilizing Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and analyzing phase portraits, it is shown that for $U_{max}\geq1$, the optimal path connecting a given initial configuration to a desired terminal configuration falls within a sufficient list of 23 path types, each comprising at most 6 segments. These segments belong to the set $\{C,G,T\}$, where $C$ represents a tight turn with radius $r=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+U_{max}^2}}$, $G$ represents a great circular arc, and $T$ represents a turn-in-place motion. Closed-form expressions for the angles of each path in the sufficient list are derived. The source code for solving the time-optimal path problem and visualization is publicly available at https://github.com/sixuli97/Optimal-Spherical-Convexified-Reeds-Shepp-Paths.</description>

Abstract: Harmonic model predictive control (HMPC) is a recent model predictive control (MPC) formulation for tracking piece-wise constant references that includes a parameterized artificial harmonic reference as a decision variable, resulting in an increased performance and domain of attraction with respect to other MPC formulations. This article presents an extension of the HMPC formulation to track periodic harmonic/sinusoidal references and discusses its use for tracking arbitrary trajectories. The proposed formulation inherits the benefits of its predecessor, namely its good performance and large domain of attraction when using small prediction horizons, and that the complexity of its optimization problem does not depend on the period of the reference. We show closed-loop results discussing its performance and comparing it to other MPC formulations.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes with Noisy Regression Inputs for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is centered around the approximation of dynamical systems by means of Gaussian processes. To this end, trajectories of such systems must be collected to be used as training data. The measurements of these trajectories are typically noisy, which implies that both the regression inputs and outputs are corrupted by noise. However, most of the literature considers only noise in the regression outputs. In this paper, we show how to account for the noise in the regression inputs in an extended Gaussian process framework to approximate scalar and multidimensional systems. We demonstrate the potential of our framework by comparing it to different state-of-the-art methods in several simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Non-overshooting output shaping for switched linear systems under arbitrary switching using eigenstructure assignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the analytical control design for a pair of switched linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems that are subject to arbitrary switching signals. A state feedback controller design method is proposed to obtain an eigenstructure assignment that ensures that the closed-loop switched system is globally asymptotically stable, and the outputs achieve the non-overshooting tracking of a step reference. Our analysis indicates whether non-overshooting or even monotonic tracking is achievable for the given system and considered outputs and provides a choice of possible eigenstructures to be assigned to the constituent subsystems. We derive a structural condition that verifies the feasibility of the chosen assignment. A constructive algorithm to obtain suitable feedback matrices is provided, and the method is illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Minimally Conservative Controlled-Invariant Set Synthesis Using Control Barrier Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a controlled-invariant set for a system with state and control constraints is crucial for safety-critical applications. However, existing methods often produce overly conservative solutions. This paper presents a method for generating controlled-invariant (safe) sets for nonlinear polynomial control-affine systems using Control Barrier Certificates (CBCs). We formulate CBC conditions as Sum-of-Squares (SOS) constraints and solve them via an SOS Program (SOSP). First, we generalize existing SOSPs for CBC synthesis to handle environments with complex unsafe state representations. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm that progressively enlarges the safe set constructed by the synthesized CBCs by maximizing boundary expansion at each iteration. We theoretically prove that our method guarantees strict safe set expansion at every step. Finally, we validate our approach with numerical simulations in 2D and 3D for single-input and multi-input systems. Empirical results show that the safe set generated by our method covers in most part a larger portion of the state space compared to two state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Set-point control and local stability for flat nonlinear systems using model-following control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set-point control problem for nonlinear systems with flat output that are subject to perturbations. The nonlinear dynamics as well as the perturbations are locally Lipschitz. We apply the model-following control (MFC) approach which consists of a model control loop (MCL) for a feedforward generation and a process control loop (PCL) that compensates the perturbations using high-gain feedback. We analyse the resulting closed-loop system and discuss its relation to a standard flatness-based high-gain approach. In particular we analyse the estimated region of attraction provided by a quadratic Lyapunov function. A case study illustrates the approach and quantifies the region of attraction obtained for each control approach. Using the initial condition of the model control loop as tuning parameter for the MFC design, provides that a significantly larger region of attraction can be guaranteed compared to a conventional single-loop high-gain design.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Extremum-Seeking Control Using Kernel-Based Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing extremum-seeking control (ESC) approaches typically rely on applying repeated perturbations to input parameters and performing measurements of the corresponding performance output. The required separation between the different timescales in the ESC loop means that performing these measurements can be time-consuming. Moreover, performing these measurements can be costly in practice, e.g., due to the use of resources. With these challenges in mind, it is desirable to reduce the number of measurements needed to optimize performance. Therefore, in this work, we present a sampled-data ESC approach aimed at reducing the number of measurements that need to be performed. In the proposed approach, we use input-output data obtained during regular operation of the extremum-seeking controller to construct online an approximation of the system's underlying cost function. By using this approximation to perform parameter updates when a decrease in the cost can be guaranteed, instead of performing additional measurements to perform this update, we make more efficient use of data collected during regular operation of the extremum-seeking controller. As a result, we indeed obtain a reduction in the required number of measurements to achieve optimization. We provide a stability analysis of the novel sampled-data ESC approach, and demonstrate the benefits of the synergy between kernel-based function approximation and standard ESC in simulation on a multi-input dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of Robustness in Multiplex Flow Networks Against Cascading Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networked systems are susceptible to cascading failures, where the failure of an initial set of nodes propagates through the network, often leading to system-wide failures. In this work, we propose a multiplex flow network model to study robustness against cascading failures triggered by random failures. The model is inspired by systems where nodes carry or support multiple types of flows, and failures result in the redistribution of flows within the same layer rather than between layers. To represent different types of interdependencies between the layers of the multiplex network, we define two cases of failure conditions: layer-independent overload and layer-influenced overload. We provide recursive equations and their solutions to calculate the steady-state fraction of surviving nodes, validate them through a set of simulation experiments, and discuss optimal load-capacity allocation strategies. Our results demonstrate that allocating the total excess capacity to each layer proportional to the mean effective load in the layer and distributing that excess capacity equally among the nodes within the layer ensures maximum robustness. The proposed framework for different failure conditions allows us to analyze the two overload conditions presented and can be extended to explore more complex interdependent relationships.</description>

      <title>Decentralized State Estimation and Opacity Verification Based on Partially Ordered Observation Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate state estimation and opacity verification problems within a decentralized observation architecture. Specifically, we consider a discrete event system whose behavior is recorded by a set of observation sites. These sites transmit the partially ordered sequences of observations that they record to a coordinator whenever a \textit{synchronization} occurs. To properly analyze the system behavior from the coordinator's viewpoint, we first introduce the notion of a Complete Synchronizing Sequence structure (CSS structure), which concisely captures the state evolution of each system state upon different information provided by the observation sites. Based on the CSS structure, we then construct corresponding current-state and initial-state estimators for offline state estimation at the coordinator. When used to verify state-isolation properties under this decentralized architecture, the use of CSS structure demonstrates a significant reduction in complexity compared with existing approaches in the literature. In particular, we discuss how to verify initial-state opacity at the coordinator, as well as a novel opacity notion, namely current-state-at-synchronization opacity.</description>

Abstract: Finding a positive state-space realization with the minimum dimension for a given transfer function is an open problem in control theory. In this paper, we focus on positive realizations in Markov form and propose a linear programming approach that computes them with a minimum dimension. Such minimum dimension of positive Markov realizations is an upper bound of the minimal positive realization dimension. However, we show that these two dimensions are equal for certain systems.</description>

      <title>Routing Guidance for Emerging Transportation Systems with Improved Dynamic Trip Equity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a dynamic routing guidance system that optimizes route recommendations for individual vehicles within an emerging transportation system while enhancing travelers' trip equity. We develop a framework to quantify trip quality and equity in a dynamic travel environment, providing new insights into how routing guidance influences equity in road transportation. Our approach enables real-time routing by incorporating both monitored and anticipated traffic congestion. We provide conditions that ensure achieving perfect trip equity for all travelers in a free-flow network. Finally, simulation studies on 1,000 vehicles traversing an urban road network in Boston demonstrate that our proposed method improves trip equity by approximately 11.4\% compared to the shortest-route strategy. In addition, the results reveal that our approach redistributes travel costs across vehicle types through route optimization, contributing to a more equitable transportation system.</description>

      <title>Insights into the explainability of Lasso-based DeePC for nonlinear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) has recently gained the spotlight as an easy-to-use control technique that allows for constraint handling while relying on raw data only. Initially proposed for linear time-invariant systems, several DeePC extensions are now available to cope with nonlinear systems. Nonetheless, these solutions mainly focus on ensuring the controller's effectiveness, overlooking the explainability of the final result. As a step toward explaining the outcome of DeePC for the control of nonlinear systems, in this paper, we focus on analyzing the earliest and simplest DeePC approach proposed to cope with nonlinearities in the controlled system, using a Lasso regularization. Our theoretical analysis highlights that the decisions undertaken by DeePC with Lasso regularization are unexplainable, as control actions are determined by data incoherent with the system's local behavior. This result is true even when the available input/output samples are grouped according to the different operating conditions explored during data collection. Our numerical study confirms these findings, highlighting the benefits of data grouping in terms of performance while showing that explainability remains a challenge in control design via DeePC.</description>

      <title>Designing Heterogeneous GNNs with Desired Permutation Properties for Wireless Resource Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been designed for learning a variety of wireless policies, i.e., the mappings from environment parameters to decision variables, thanks to their superior performance, and the potential in enabling scalability and size generalizability. These merits are rooted in leveraging permutation prior, i.e., satisfying the permutation property of the policy to be learned (referred to as desired permutation property). Many wireless policies are with complicated permutation properties. To satisfy these properties, heterogeneous GNNs (HetGNNs) should be used to learn such policies. There are two critical factors that enable a HetGNN to satisfy a desired permutation property: constructing an appropriate heterogeneous graph and judiciously designing the architecture of the HetGNN. However, both the graph and the HetGNN are designed heuristically so far. In this paper, we strive to provide a systematic approach for the design to satisfy the desired permutation property. We first propose a method for constructing a graph for a policy, where the edges and their types are defined for the sake of satisfying complicated permutation properties. Then, we provide and prove three sufficient conditions to design a HetGNN such that it can satisfy the desired permutation property when learning over an appropriate graph. These conditions suggest a method of designing the HetGNN with desired permutation property by sharing the processing, combining, and pooling functions according to the types of vertices and edges of the graph. We take power allocation and hybrid precoding policies as examples for demonstrating how to apply the proposed methods and validating the impact of the permutation prior by simulations.</description>

      <title>Battery Operations in Electricity Markets: Strategic Behavior and Distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing a major transformation as they integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and batteries to smooth out variations in renewable energy production. As privately-owned batteries grow from their role as marginal "price-takers" to significant players in the market, a natural question arises: How do batteries operate in electricity markets, and how does the strategic behavior of decentralized batteries distort decisions compared to centralized batteries? We propose an analytically tractable model that captures salient features of the highly complex electricity market. We derive in closed form the resulting battery behavior and generation cost in three operating regimes: (i) no battery, (ii) centralized battery, and (ii) decentralized profit-maximizing battery. We establish that a decentralized battery distorts its discharge decisions in three ways. First, there is quantity withholding, i.e., discharging less than centrally optimal. Second, there is a shift in participation from day-ahead to real-time, i.e., postponing some of its discharge from day-ahead to real-time. Third, there is reduction in real-time responsiveness, or discharging less in response to smoothing real-time demand than centrally optimal. We also quantify the impact of the battery market power on total system cost via the Price of Anarchy metric, and prove that the it is always between $9/8$ and $4/3$. That is, incentive misalignment always exists, but it is bounded even in the worst case. We calibrate our model to real data from Los Angeles and Houston. Lastly, we show that competition is very effective at reducing distortions, but many market power mitigation mechanisms backfire, and lead to higher total cost.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm in General-sum Markov Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>1-2-3-Go! Policy Synthesis for Parameterized Markov Decision Processes via Decision-Tree Learning and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the advances in probabilistic model checking, the scalability of the verification methods remains limited. In particular, the state space often becomes extremely large when instantiating parameterized Markov decision processes (MDPs) even with moderate values. Synthesizing policies for such \emph{huge} MDPs is beyond the reach of available tools. We propose a learning-based approach to obtain a reasonable policy for such huge MDPs.
  The idea is to generalize optimal policies obtained by model-checking small instances to larger ones using decision-tree learning. Consequently, our method bypasses the need for explicit state-space exploration of large models, providing a practical solution to the state-space explosion problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by performing extensive experimentation on the relevant models from the quantitative verification benchmark set. The experimental results indicate that our policies perform well, even when the size of the model is orders of magnitude beyond the reach of state-of-the-art analysis tools.</description>

Abstract: The educational system manages extensive documentation and paperwork, which can lead to human errors and sometimes abuse or fraud, such as the falsification of diplomas, certificates or other credentials. In fact, in the last years, multiple cases of fraud have been detected, which have a significant cost to society, since they harm the trustworthiness of certificates and academic institutions. To tackle such an issue, this article proposes a solution aimed at recording and verifying academic records through a decentralized application that is supported by a smart contract deployed in the Ethereum blockchain and by a decentralized storage system based on Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). The proposed solution is evaluated in terms of performance and energy-efficiency, comparing the results obtained with a traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol and the new Proof-of-Authority (PoA) protocol. The results shown in this paper indicate that the latter is clearly greener and demands less CPU load. Moreover, this article compares the performance of a traditional computer and two SBCs (a Raspberry Pi 4 and an Orange Pi One), showing that is possible to make use of the latter low-power devices to implement blockchain nodes but at the cost of higher response latency. Furthermore, the impact of Ethereum gas limit is evaluated, demonstrating its significant influence on the blockchain network performance. Thus, this article provides guidelines, useful practical evaluations and key findings that will help the next generation of green blockchain developers and researchers.</description>

Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, for 2nd order PDEs with periodic boundary conditions, the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$ is nontrivial on the PDE domain, and solutions may converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in this nullspace. To test this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how we can model these trajectories for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any function $\mathbf{u}(t)$ in the PDE domain can be decomposed into a component defined by $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$, and a component $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$ existing in the nullspace of $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$ and $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined for trajectories $\mathbf{u}^*(t)=\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$, and it is shown that stability of these trajectories as well as of the equilibrium $\mathbf{u}^*\equiv0$ can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of exponential decay.</description>
