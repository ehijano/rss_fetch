      <title>Critical Probability Distributions of the order parameter at two loops II: $O(n)$ universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to compute the probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(n)$ model at two-loop order of perturbation theory generalizing the methods developed for computing the same in case of the Ising model \cite{Sahu:2025bkp}. We show that even for the $O(n)$ model, there exists not one but a family of these probability distribution functions indexed by $\zeta$ which is the ratio of system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$. We also compare these PDFs to the Monte-Carlo simulations and the existing FRG results \cite{Rancon:2025bjf} for the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic 1D search-and-capture as a G/M/c queueing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the accumulation of resources within a target due to the interplay between continual delivery, driven by 1D stochastic search processes, and the sequential consumption of resources. The assumption of sequential consumption is key because it changes the commonly used $G/M/\infty$ queue to a $G/M/c$ queue. Combining the theory of $G/M/c$ queues with the theory of first-passage times, we derive general conditions for the search process to ensure that the number of resources within the queue converges to a steady state and compute explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the number of resources within the queue at steady state. We then compare the performance of the $G/M/c$ queue with that of the $G/M/\infty$ queue for an increasing number of servers. We extend the model to consider two competing targets and show that, under specific scenarios, an additional target is beneficial to the original target. Finally, we study the effects of multiple searchers. Using renewal theory, we numerically compute the inter-arrival time density for $M$ searchers in the Laplace space, which allows us to exploit the explicit expressions for the steady-state statistics of the number of resources within $G/M/1$ and $G/M/\infty$ queues, and compare their behavior with different numbers of searchers. Overall, the $G/M/c$ queue shows a tighter dependence on the configuration of the search process than the $G/M/\infty$ queue does.</description>

      <title>Inertia-induced mechanism for giant enhancement of transport generated by active fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter is one of the hottest topics in physics nowadays. As a prototype of living systems operating in viscous environments it has usually been modeled in terms of the overdamped dynamics. Recently, active matter in the underdamped regime has gained a place in the spotlight. In this work we unveil another remarkable face of active matter. In doing so we demonstrate and explain an inertia-induced mechanism of giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations which does emerge neither in the overdamped nor in the underdamped limit but occurs exclusively in the strong damping regime. It may be relevant not only for living systems where fluctuations generated by the metabolism are active by default but also for artificial ones, in particular for designing ultrafast micro and nano-robots. Our findings open new avenues of research in a very vibrant field of active matter.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic anomalies in overdamped systems with time-dependent temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key objectives in investigating small stochastic systems is the development of micrometer-sized engines and the understanding of their thermodynamics. However, the primary mathematical tool used for this purpose, the overdamped approximation, has a critical limitation: it fails to fully capture the thermodynamics when the temperature varies over time, as the velocity is not considered in the approximation. Specifically, we show that heat dissipation and entropy production calculated under the overdamped approximation deviate from their true values. These discrepancies are termed thermodynamic anomalies. To overcome this limitation, we analytically derive expressions for these anomalies in the presence of a general time-varying temperature. One notable feature of the result is that high viscosity and small mass, though both leading to the same overdamped dynamic equations, result in different thermodynamic anomaly relations. Our results have significant implications, particularly for accurately calculating the efficiency of heat engines operating in overdamped environments with time-varying temperatures, without requiring velocity measurements. Additionally, our findings offer a simple method for estimating the kinetic energy of an overdamped system.</description>

      <title>The Hungry Daemon: An energy-harvesting active particle must obey the Second Law of Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thought experiments like Maxwell's Demon or the Feynman-Smoluchowski Ratchet can help in pursuing the microscopic origin of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Here we present a more sophisticated physical system than a ratchet, consisting of a Hamiltonian active particle which can harvest energy from an environment which may be in thermal equilibrium at a single temperature. We show that while a phenomenological description would seem to allow the system to operate as a Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind, a full mechanical analysis confirms that this is impossible, and that perpetual energy harvesting can only occur if the environment has an energetic population inversion similar to a lasing medium.</description>

      <title>Higher order tacnodes in a free fermionic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. In the case of nearest neighbor hoppings, this model is known to give rise to limit shapes and arctic curves for large time and fermion number, with in particular two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Fluctuations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. In this paper we study the analogous picture in the presence of a next nearest interactions. In particular, we discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile. We also study the behavior of correlations close to the merger point, and find a novel higher order tacnode kernel governing them.</description>

      <title>Taking the temperature of quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum many-body scar is an eigenstate of a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian that exhibits two seemingly incongruous properties: its energy eigenvalue corresponds to a high temperature, yet its entanglement structure resembles that of low-temperature eigenstates, such as ground states. Traditionally, a temperature is assigned to an energy \emph{eigenvalue} through the textbook canonical temperature-energy relationship. However, in this work, we use the \emph{eigenstate subsystem temperature} -- a recently developed quantity that assigns a temperature to an energy eigenstate, based on the structure of its reduced density matrix. For a thermal state, the eigenstate subsystem temperature is approximately equal to its canonical temperature. Given that quantum many-body scars have a ground-state-like entanglement structure, it is not immediately clear that their eigenstate subsystem temperature would be close to their canonical temperature. Surprisingly, we find that this is the case: the quantum many-body scars have approximate ``knowledge'' of their position in the spectrum encoded within their state structure.</description>

      <title>Many-body Localization in a Slowly Varying Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study many-body localization (MBL) in a nearest-neighbor hopping 1D lattice with a slowly varying (SV) on-site potential $U_j = \lambda\cos(\pi\alpha j^s)$ with $0&lt;s&lt;1$. The corresponding non-interacting 1D lattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility edges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has similar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or quasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement entropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further investigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic regime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG analysis shows a subvolume scaling $\sim L^{d_{\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\rm MBL} \approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal clusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties and find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these quantities, we compute the critical exponent $\nu$ using different parameters $s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed potential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\nu\approx2$. This exponent $\nu \approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars but differs from the random model. This observation suggests that the SV model and the QP model may belong to the same universality class, which is, however, likely distinct from the random universality class.</description>

      <title>Ostwald Ripening of Buoyancy-Driven Microbubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbubble solutions have a wide range of industrial applications, including heat transfer, agriculture, and water treatment. Therefore, understanding and controlling the size variation of bubbles is critical. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework for Ostwald ripening in buoyancy-driven microbubbles by introducing a height-dependent size distribution function. For the first time, we show that the population balance equation in steady state can be interpreted within the Lifshitz-Slezov-Wagner theory when the distribution function is redefined as the density distribution of the buoyancy-induced flux. Notably, in this form of Ostwald ripening, the distribution function approaches a scaled universal distribution, not over time, but as a function of height. We analytically derive the scaled universal distribution and show that the fifth power of the mean radius of the bubbles grows linearly with height.</description>

      <title>Universal Defect Statistics in Counterdiabatic Quantum Critical Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving (CD) provides a framework to reduce excitations in nonadiabatic processes. Exact CD protocols require nonlocal control fields, and CD approximations with tailored locality are needed for their implementation. However, the performance of local CD schemes remains poorly understood. We consider the local CD across a quantum phase transition at an arbitrary rate. We establish its efficiency as a function of the degree of locality and demonstrate that the resulting defect statistics exhibit universal behavior. Our results provide an analytical framework for evaluating the effectiveness of local CD protocols in quantum state preparation, control, and optimization.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant inter-species interaction and its effect on the position response function of cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, the position response of a particle, coupled to a bath, subjected to an external force is a topic of broad interest. A topic of further interest is two distinguishable sets of interacting particles in contact with two different baths. Here, we report the experimental evidence of the modification of the position response function (PRF) of an ensemble of cold atoms in a magneto-optical trap when it is placed alongside a dilute cloud of cold atoms of a different species. Our experiment consists of a mass-imbalanced cold atomic mixture of Potassium and Sodium atoms. We focus on the position response of Potassium atoms when subjected to a sudden displacement in the presence of a cold Sodium atomic cloud. Notably, we find that, in the underdamped regime of motion, the oscillation frequency of motion of the cold atoms changes as much as 30 $\%$ depending on the effective inter-species light-assisted interaction strength. On the other hand, in the overdamped regime, there is a reduction, as high as 10.5 $\%$ in the damping coefficient, depending on the interaction strength. Using a quantum Langevin approach, we develop a framework that aligns well with experimental results, with potential applications in mass and charge transport studies under varied physical conditions simulated in cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Solvent-Induced Negative Energetic Elasticity in a Lattice Polymer Chain''</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent Letter, Shirai and Sakumichi [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023), arXiv:2202.12483] presented a study focusing on the origin of a temperature-dependent negative contribution $G_U(T)$ to the elastic modulus $G(T)$ of hydrogels [Yoshikawa et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011045 (2021)]. The authors support their findings through an energy-related stiffness $k_U(r,T)$ obtained from a single chain, with $r$ being the end-to-end distance of a random walk on a 3D lattice. It is argued that the parameter $\varepsilon$ related to polymer-solvent interactions is positive, so the energy $E_s$ of an elongated state should be smaller than the energy $E_b$ of a more compact state. We believe that the analogy between $G_U(T)$ and $k_U(r,T)$ might have misled their claim that $G_U(T)&lt;0$ when $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Revivals Via Projective Measurements in a Quantum Scarred System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarred systems exhibit atypical dynamical behavior, evading thermalization and featuring periodic state revivals. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of projective measurements on the dynamics in the scar subspace for the paradigmatic PXP model, revealing that they can either disrupt or enhance the revivals. Local measurements performed at random times rapidly erase the system's memory of its initial conditions, leading to fast steady-state relaxation. In contrast, a periodic monitoring amplifies recurrences and preserves the coherent dynamics over extended timescales. We identify a measurement-induced phase resynchronization, countering the natural dephasing of quantum scars, as the key mechanism underlying this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Giant increase of diffusion by small rise of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficient usually decreases when friction increases. We analyze the opposite behavior in the paradigmatic system consisting of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric spatially periodic potential and driven by an unbiased time periodic force. For tailored parameter set in strong dissipation regime the particle spreading can be giantly amplified: if the friction is twice as large then the diffusion grows up to five orders of magnitude. The mechanism lying behind this effect is related to bifurcation of periodic orbits oscillating around the potential maximum and their symmetric displacement towards the adjacent potential minima when the friction coefficient increases. On the other hand, in the weak dissipation regime, where the increase of diffusion vs friction is also observed, the effect is induced by a non-monotonic change of population of the running orbits. However, in this regime the enhancement of diffusion is much smaller.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in mass transport processes with center-of-mass conservation: Some exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize steady-state static and dynamic properties in a broad class of mass transport processes on a periodic hypercubic lattice of volume $L^d$, where both mass and {\it center-of-mass} (CoM) remain conserved and detailed balance is violated in the bulk; we specifically consider these models in $d=1$ and $2$ dimensions. Using a microscopic approach, we exactly determine the decay (or, growth) exponents for various dynamic and static correlation functions. We show that, despite constrained dynamics due to the CoM conservation (CoMC), the density relaxation is indeed diffusive. However, fluctuation properties are strikingly different from that in the diffusive systems with a single (mass) conservation law. In the thermodynamic limit, the steady-state variance $\langle {\cal Q}^2(T) \rangle_c$ of time-integrated bond current ${\cal Q}(T)$ across a bond in time interval $T$ exhibits the following long-time behavior: $\langle {\cal Q}^2(T) \rangle_c \simeq A_1 T + A_2 + A_3 T^{-d/2}$. Remarkably, depending on dimensions and microscopic details, the prefactor $A_1$ can vanish (e.g., for $d=1$), causing the variance to eventually {\it saturate}. The exponents governing the small-frequency behavior of the power spectrum $S_J(f) \sim f^{\psi_J}$ for bond current are exactly determined as $\psi_J=3/2$ and $2$ in $d=1$ and $2$ dimensions, respectively, implying a ``dynamic hyperuniformity''. We also compute the static structure factor $S(q)$, which, in the small-$q$ limit, varies as the square of wave number $q$, i.e., $S(q) \sim q^2$. Indeed, both dynamic and static fluctuations are anomalously suppressed, resulting in an extreme form of (``class I'') hyperuniformity in the systems.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for the Ericson Transition in Stochastic Quantum Scattering and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At lower energies, the resonances in scattering experiments are often isolated. The crucial parameter is the ratio of average resonance width and average mean level spacing. Towards larger energies, this parameter grows, because the resonances overlap. Eventually the cross-section becomes a random function and the scattering matrix elements follow a universal Gaussian distribution. For more than sixty years, this Ericson transition awaits a concise analytical treatment. We provide a complete solution within the Heidelberg approach which provides a full-fledged model of the scattering process. As a side result, we obtain explicit formulae for the moments of the distributions. We compare with microwave experiments.</description>

      <title>Content-Addressable Memory with a Content-Free Energy Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Free fermions under adaptive quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study free fermion systems under adaptive quantum dynamics consisting of unitary gates and projective measurements followed by corrective unitary operations. We further introduce a classical flag for each site, allowing for an active or inactive status which determines whether or not the unitary gates are allowed to apply. In this dynamics, the individual quantum trajectories exhibit a measurement-induced entanglement transition from critical to area-law scaling above a critical measurement rate, similar to previously studied models of free fermions under continuous monitoring. Furthermore, we find that the corrective unitary operations can steer the system into a state characterized by charge-density-wave order. Consequently, an additional phase transition occurs, which can be observed at both the level of the quantum trajectory and the quantum channel. We establish that the entanglement transition and the steering transition are fundamentally distinct. The latter transition belongs to the parity-conserving (PC) universality class, arising from the interplay between the inherent fermionic parity and classical labelling. We demonstrate both the entanglement and the steering transitions via efficient numerical simulations of free fermion systems, which confirm the PC universality class of the latter.</description>

      <title>The i.i.d. State Convertibility in the Resource Theory of Asymmetry for Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive both the exact and approximate conversion rates between i.i.d. pure states under covariant operations in the resource theory of asymmetry for symmetries described by finite groups. We derive the formula for the exact conversion rate, and thereby identifying the relevant set of resource measures. The exact conversion is in general irreversible due to multiple independent resource measures, but we also find the condition for reversibility. On the other hand, we show that the approximate conversion rate either diverges or equals zero, which implies that the asymmetry can be amplified infinitely if we allow a vanishingly small error. We reveal the underlying mechanism of such a counterintuitive phenomenon, by showing the existence of a "uniform state" that acts as a catalysis.</description>

      <title>Certifying quantum enhancements in thermal machines beyond the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>

      <title>Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact-angle size-dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact-angle cosine for both axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a commonly used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact-angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact-line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, the adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the contribution related to the contact line in the leading order and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using droplet-size dependences of the contact angle for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole by constructing non-perturbative length and timeshift operators in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We first construct projection operators onto the fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift subspaces using the replica trick. We calculate the densities of state for the length and the timeshift, which are found to be finite. This finiteness implies the discreteness in the spectrum of these quantities. We then construct the non-perturbative length and timeshift operators, and apply them to study the time evolution of the two-sided black hole. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty. In particular, the probability of having the negative timeshift states, which corresponds to the white hole probability, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-integrability in a non-Hermitian time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, exhibiting repeating patterns in time. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian Floquet systems can host a time crystalline phase with quasi-long-range order. In this work, we investigate the effect of introducing a non-integrable interaction term into this non-Hermitian time crystal model. Using a combination of numerical TEBD simulations, mean-field analysis, and perturbation theory, we find that the interaction term has two notable effects. First, it induces a shift in the phase diagram, moving the boundaries between different phases. Second, a sufficiently strong interaction induces an unexpected symmetry-breaking transition, which is not captured by the mean-field approach. Within average Hamiltonian theory, we trace this back to a ferromagnetic transition in the anisotropic non-Hermitian XXZ model. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and many-body interactions can lead to novel symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>
