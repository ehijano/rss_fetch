      <title>A Hierarchy of Fibonacci Forbidden-Word Hamiltonians: From the Golden Chain to the Plastic Chain and Aperiodic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an infinite, scale-aligned hierarchy of one-dimensional, frustration-free Hamiltonians by forbidding the minimal forbidden factors of the Fibonacci word up to length $F_K$, the $K$-th Fibonacci number. The ground-state languages have exponential growth constants $\lambda_K$ that decrease monotonically, starting from the value associated with the ``golden chain'' (approximately 1.618) and progressing toward 1. This process yields a staircase of topological-entropy plateaus that flows to an aperiodic fixed point, also known as the Fibonacci subshift. The first nontrivial rung ($K=4$) is the ``Plastic chain,'' which forbids \texttt{SS} and \texttt{LLL}. We prove its ground-state counts follow a specific four-term linear recurrence relation and provide a closed-form solution governed by the plastic constant $\rho\approx 1.3247$. We propose an energy-entropy scaling where the energy penalty for each new forbidden pattern is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of the growth constants from the previous and current rungs, turning the sequence of projectors into an explicit renormalization-group flow from the initial high-entropy phase to the zero-entropy aperiodic fixed point. Algebraically, exact Temperley-Lieb braiding compatibility holds only at the base rung, $K=3$ (which forbids only \texttt{SS}); higher rungs define constrained aperiodic Hamiltonian codes rather than Temperley-Lieb representations. Small instances realized on a D-Wave quantum annealer match these predictions: $K=3$ is trivial, $K=4$ resolves a unit gap with moderate success, and $K\ge 5$ instances require reverse annealing to exceed $99\%$ success, clarifying reduction penalties and embedding variability.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Quantum Advantage in Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are used for pattern recognition analysis of big data, without direct human intervention. The task of unsupervised learning is to find the probability distribution that would best describe the available data, and then use it to make predictions for observables of interest. Classical models generally fit the data to Boltzmann distribution of Hamiltonians with a large number of tunable parameters. Quantum extensions of these models replace classical probability distributions with quantum density matrices. An advantage can be obtained only when features of density matrices that are absent in classical probability distributions are exploited. Such situations depend on the input data as well as the targeted observables. Explicit examples are discussed that bring out the constraints limiting possible quantum advantage. The problem-dependent extent of quantum advantage has implications for both data analysis and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Entanglement Dynamics in Driven Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of key quantum correlations - Negativity (NG), Quantum Discord (QD), and Quantum-Memory-Assisted Entropic Uncertainty (QM-EUR) - in a bipartite two-qubit system under the influence of external pulses and various decoherence channels, including amplitude damping (gamma_amp), pure dephasing (gamma_deph), and pulse-induced dephasing (G), while different regimes of inter-qubit coupling (Jzz, Jxx), qubit energy splitting (epsilon), and pulse parameters (A_pulse, beta_pulse) are explored. Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication.</description>

      <title>Entanglement boosting: Low-volume logical Bell pair preparation for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed architecture is a promising route to scaling fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) beyond the inherent limitations of single processors. For practical implementation of distributed FTQC, logical Bell pair preparation must be designed not only for efficient Bell pair consumption but also for the spacetime volume of the protocol; however, entanglement distillation protocols have primarily focused on minimizing the consumption of Bell pairs, often resulting in protocols that require a substantial number of local operations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations. Guided by this metric, we propose entanglement boosting protocol, which achieves efficient preparation of logical Bell pairs encoded in rotated surface code with LLV reduced by orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. In this protocol, paralleling recent advances in magic state cultivation, we employ soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress the logical error rates of Bell pairs to practical levels in the order of $10^{-10}$ from fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs while all local operations are implementable within a spatial region of a single surface code patch. We also present a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation using high-rate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling arbitrarily low logical error rates while also maintaining physically efficient implementations. These results pave the way for the practical implementation of distributed FTQC, reinforcing the benefits of fast interconnect technologies and serving as a guiding principle for the efficient design of protocols and devices.</description>

      <title>Optimal propagation distance for maximal biphoton entanglement through the weakly turbulent atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of entangled biphoton states is essential for free-space quantum communication protocols. Using the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and the Kolmogorov turbulence model, we derive an analytical expression for the combined density operator of the signal and idler fields generated via SPDC, following propagation through separate turbulent channels. By expressing this density operator in the continuous position basis, we show how the spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, as they transition from being quantum to classical in nature. We further identify a finite range of propagation distances over which the angle-OAM entanglement is maximized, which provides valuable insights for designing free-space quantum communication links operating over several kilometers through the turbulent atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Nature of Depth-1 Equivariant Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Equivariant Quantum Circuit (EQC) for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been shown to achieve near-optimal performance in solving small TSP problems (up to 20 nodes) using only two parameters at depth 1. However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes. We provide a theoretical explanation for SIGS called the Size-Invariant Properties that goes beyond the concept of equivariance discussed in prior literature.</description>

      <title>Certifying the dimensionality of any quantum channel with minimal assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement offers significant advantages over low-dimensional ones in various information-processing tasks. However, to harness these advantages, it is crucial that the quantum channels used to store or transmit the subsystems of an entangled system not only preserve entanglement but also maintain its dimensionality above a certain threshold. The maximum entanglement dimension that a channel can preserve is referred to as its effective dimensionality, since the channel cannot be used to transmit information of dimension greater than that in a single use. In this work, we present a method to certify whether a quantum channel can preserve entanglement dimension above a given threshold. Unlike existing approaches, our method is faithful -- it can be applied to any channel, and avoids common assumptions such as reliable preparation of entangled states, auxiliary side channels, or perfect measurement devices. Moreover, the method can be extended to faithfully certify other classes of non-resource-breaking channels, such as non-NPT-breaking channels. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our certification scheme through explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Correlated Purification for Restoring $N$-Representability in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography offers a scalable route to estimating properties of quantum states, but the resulting reduced density matrices (RDMs) often violate constraints that ensure they represent $N$-electron states -- known as $N$-representability conditions -- because of statistical and hardware noise. We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves. This framework provides a robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Universal Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation for Quantum $f-$Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any Petz $f$-divergence (where $f$ is operator convex) between quantum states admits a universal $\chi^2$-mixture representation: the distinguishability of $\rho$ from $\sigma$ is obtained as a positive superposition of quadratic contrasts $\chi^2_\lambda$, with nonnegative weights $w_f(\lambda)$ determined explicitly from the Stieltjes representation of the generator $f$. This identifies $\chi^2_\lambda$ as atomic building blocks for quantum $f$-divergences and yields closed-form $w_f$ for canonical choices (relative entropy/KL, Hellinger/Bures, R'{e}nyi). By mapping $\chi^2_\lambda$ into a classical Pearson $\chi^2$, we leverage the Chapman-Robbins variational representation and obtain a tight and universal quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation: any $f$-divergence is lower bounded by a function of the statistics of quantum observables (mean and variance), reproducing previous and novel results in quantum thermodynamics as applications.</description>

      <title>Query complexities of quantum channel discrimination and estimation: A unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of quantum channel discrimination and estimation is to determine the identity of an unknown channel from a discrete or continuous set, respectively. The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds. We also provide alternative proofs for several established results in an effort to present a consistent and unified framework for quantum channel discrimination and estimation, which we believe will be helpful in addressing future questions in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present hybrid Gibbs sampling algorithms for the stabilizer code Hamiltonians of the rotated surface code and the toric code with only local quantum algorithms, using $\sim L/2$ quantum circuit depth to prepare the Gibbs state of the rotated surface code Hamiltonian, and $L$ quantum circuit depth to prepare the Gibbs state of the toric code Hamiltonian, being $L$ the side of the side of the square lattice. We further show that if we allow for non-local gates, the Gibbs state of the periodic 1D Ising model can be prepared in logarithmic depth and linearly many simultaneous measurements.</description>

      <title>A New Quantum Secure Time Transfer System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision clock synchronization is essential for a wide range of network-distributed applications. In the quantum space, these applications include communication, sensing, and positioning. However, current synchronization techniques are vulnerable to attacks, such as intercept-resend attacks, spoofing, and delay attacks. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new quantum secure time transfer (QSTT) system, subsequently used for clock synchronization, that largely negates such attacks. Novel to our system is the optimal use of self-generated quantum keys within the QSTT to information-theoretically secure the maximum amount of timing data; as well as the introduction, within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, of an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption sequence of the remaining timing data. With these enhancements, we argue that our new system represents the most robust implementation of QSTT to date.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Macroscopic Quantum Synchronization in an Ensemble of Two-level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous macroscopic quantum synchronization is an emergent phenomenon where an ensemble of quantum oscillators achieves global phase coherence through the interplay of interaction and dissipation. To illuminate this phenomenon, we study an ensemble of two-level systems (TLS) and establish its associated nonlinear quantum master equation, for which self-consistent analytical solutions of quantum synchronization can be obtained. The trajectories on the Bloch sphere vividly illustrate how dissipation and interaction drive the system toward a synchronized state. We present a phase diagram for macroscopic synchronization as a function of interaction strength and the gain-to-damping ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate full synchronization and partial synchronization between two groups of TLS with different natural frequencies. This work establishes ensemble of TLS as a remarkable system for understanding spontaneous quantum synchronization.</description>

      <title>A Compilation Framework for Quantum Circuits with Mid-Circuit Measurement Error Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement (MCM) provides the capability for qubit reuse and dynamic control in quantum processors, enabling more resource-efficient algorithms and supporting error-correction procedures. However, MCM introduces several sources of error, including measurement-induced crosstalk, idling-qubit decoherence, and reset infidelity, and these errors exhibit pronounced qubit-dependent variability within a single device. Since existing compilers such as the Qiskit-compiler and QR-Map (the state-of-art qubit reuse compiler) do not account for this variability, circuits with frequent MCM operations often experience substantial fidelity loss.
  In thie paper, we propose MERA, a compilation framework that performs MCM-error-aware layout, routing, and scheduling. MERA leverages lightweight profiling to obtain a stable per-qubit MCM error distribution, which it uses to guide error-aware qubit mapping and SWAP insertions. To further mitigate MCM-related decoherence and crosstalk, MERA augments as-late-as-possible scheduling with context-aware dynamic decoupling. Evaluated on 27 benchmark circuits, MERA achieves 24.94% -- 52.00% fidelity improvement over the Qiskit compiler (optimization level 3) without introducing additional overhead. On QR-Map-generated circuits, it improves fidelity by 29.26% on average and up to 122.58% in the best case, demonstrating its effectiveness for dynamic circuits dominated by MCM operations.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the nondemolition nature of a quantum measurement via an adaptive readout protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) supports the negotiation and sharing of private keys with unconditional security between authorized parties. Over the years, theoretical advances and experimental demonstrations have successfully transitioned QKD from laboratory research to commercial applications. As QKD expands its reach globally, it encounters challenges such as performance limitations, cost, and practical security concerns. Nonetheless, innovations in satellite-based QKD and the development of new protocols are paving the way towards a worldwide network. In this review, we provide an overview of QKD implementations, with a focus on protocols, devices, and quantum channels. We discuss the challenges of practical QKD and explore long-haul QKD. Additionally, we highlight the future research directions that are expected to significantly advance the realization of a global QKD network.</description>

      <title>Memory-Assisted Nonlocal Interferometer Towards Long-Baseline Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks and remote quantum entanglement serve as vital future quantum communication resources with broad applicability. A key direction lies in extending the baseline of optical interferometers to enhance angular resolution in interferometric imaging. Here, by measuring a simulated thermal light field, we report the demonstration of a memory-assisted nonlocal interferometer achieving a fiber-link baseline up to 20 km while simultaneously showing its capability to compensate for a geometric delay equivalent to 1.5 km. This result demonstrates potential for enhancing the angular resolution of interferometric imaging in the optical band with delocalized single-photon entanglement, and paves the way for future application of quantum memories in astronomical observation.</description>

      <title>Unconditional and exponentially large violation of classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing the predictions of quantum mechanics has been one of the main experimental endeavors for decades. Recent advancements in technology led to a number of demonstrations which test non-classicality via specific computational tasks. Limitations of these experiments include dependence on complexity theory assumptions, susceptibility to hardware noise and inefficient verification, raising questions about their scalability. We propose to test non-classicality using a game based on complement sampling, an efficiently verifiable problem that achieves the largest possible separation between quantum and classical computation when both input and output represent samples from probability distributions. When restricting the input to instances inspired by the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, our game admits an exponentially large violation of classicality without relying on computational hardness assumptions. We execute the game on Quantinuum System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computers, with experiments consisting of thousands of different circuits on up to 55 qubits. The observed scores can be explained by a systematic adoption of a quantum strategy, further corroborating the quantum nature of the hardware in an efficient and scalable way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fast-forward and time-scaling properties of superconducting resonators under a coherent drive. We propose a scheme for perfect displacement of a superconducting resonator by modulating the drive amplitude based on fast-forward scaling theory. Furthermore, we propose a scheme exploiting both the fast-forward and time-scaling properties that enables perfect displacement through detuning modulation. The proposed schemes are also applicable to a subsystem that can be effectively represented by a driven resonator. In particular, we apply the latter scheme to fast and high-fidelity displacement of a coupler between Kerr parametric oscillators.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux and its topological effects in Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a physical phenomenon in which the quantum state of a charged particle acquires a phase shift that is directly proportional to the magnetic flux, $\Phi$, due to a (classical) magnetic field, ${\mathbf B}$, which is confined in a spatial region from which the magnetic field cannot escape. Even though the charged particle is not allowed to interact with the magnetic field, it accumulates a phase shift that affects the interference pattern produced. Not surprisingly, this apparent nonlocality is puzzling and counter intuitive. In this work, we provide an explanation that explains the physics underlying this apparent nonlocality. We find that the role of the confined magnetic field is to impart a puncture in the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2$, of the charge. Therefore, the quantum state corresponding to the charged quantum particle acquires the phase shift due to its response to the modified topology of the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, corresponding to the charge.</description>

      <title>Electrical thermography via centimetre-scale fiber-based distributed temperature sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Raman-based Distributed Temperature Sensor (RDTS) with centimetre-scale resolution for thermographic analysis of electronic circuits. Temperature is measured along a single-mode fiber routed across a custom printed circuit board (PCB) with 1 cm$^2$ heating elements, using optical time-domain reflectometry of Raman signals detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). This approach enables two-dimensional thermal mapping of the PCB under heating configurations with multiple hotspots. A spatial resolution of 3 cm and a temperature accuracy of 2 {\deg}C are achieved with an integration time of 5 minutes. Thermography can be performed down to 77 K, revealing that the PCB thermal resistance decreases by nearly an order of magnitude compared to room temperature, due to enhanced convective cooling in liquid nitrogen. These results establish centimetre-scale RDTS as a robust technique for real-time, spatially resolved thermography of electronic circuits, particularly in regimes where infrared imaging is ineffective, such as at low temperatures or within volumetric electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>The Riemann Hypothesis Emerges in Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-electron quantum optics provides a versatile platform for manipulating electrons at the quantum level with potential applications in quantum information technologies. We propose a grating-based architecture for fully quantized free-electron quantum optics, in which photon-electron interactions map onto Jaynes-Cummings and Tavis-Cummings models via Bloch-Floquet analysis. Within this framework, we design ultrafast single- and two-qubit gates with cavity-free flying electrons, enabling universal quantum computing in experimentally accessible setups. More broadly, this framework establishes a platform for probing free-electron quantum optics and advancing quantum technologies in simulation, sensing, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy for locally squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.</description>

      <title>Efficient circuits for leaf-separable state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient state preparation is a challenging and important problem in quantum computing. In this work, we present a recursive state preparation algorithm that combines logarithmic-depth Dicke state circuits with Hamming weight encoders for efficiently preparing ``leaf-separable" quantum states. The algorithm is built on binary partition trees, generalized weight distribution blocks (gWDBs), and leaf-level encoders. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by numerically simulating it on randomly generated target states with between 4 and 15 qubits. Compared to general state preparation approaches which require $O(2^n)$ CX gates, our algorithm achieves a circuit depth of $O(k\log\frac{n}{k} + 2^k)$ and uses $O(n(k+2^k))$ two-qubit gates, where $k &lt; n$ denotes the subtree size. We also compare implementations of the algorithm with and without the use of ancilla qubits, providing a detailed analysis of the trade-offs in circuit depth and two-qubit gate counts. These results contribute to scalable state preparation for quantum algorithms that require structured inputs such as Dicke or near-Dicke states.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolarized Molecular Nuclear Spins Achieve Magnetic Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of nuclear spins as physical sensing systems is disadvantaged by their low signal responsivity, particularly when compared to sensing techniques based on electron spins. This primarily results from the small nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and the difficulties in achieving high spin polarization. Here we develop a new approach to investigating the response of hyperpolarized molecular nuclear spins to magnetic fields and demonstrate orders-of-magnitude enhanced magnetic responsivity over state-of-the-art proton and Overhauser magnetometers. Using hyperpolarized molecules with proton spins, we report the realization of magnetic amplification in linear and nonlinear types. We further extend this amplification to hyperpolarized scalar-coupled multi-spin molecules and observe substantial magnetic amplification exceeding 10%. Moreover, we observe an anomalous amplification with dispersive frequency dependence that originates from magnetic interference effects. Our work highlights the potential of hyperpolarized molecular nuclear spins for use in a new class of quantum sensors, with promising applications in both applied and fundamental physics, including highly accurate absolute magnetometry and the exploration of axion-nucleon exotic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limit-cycle oscillators are the basic building blocks for synchronization; yet, the notion of a quantum limit cycle has remained unclear. Here, we study quantum limit cycles and synchronization in the presence of continuous heterodyne measurement. The resulting quantum trajectories, i.e., time evolutions of the quantum state conditioned on the measurement outcome, make the quantum limit cycles apparent. We focus on the paradigmatic model of the quantum van-der-Pol oscillator and on two-level systems. Our work provides insights into limit cycles in quantum systems, emphasizing their similarity to classical limit cycles subject to noise. Additionally, we connect theoretical measures of quantum synchronization to quantities experimentally accessible via heterodyne detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compatibility of special relativity and Quantum Mechanics has been questioned by several authors. The origin of this tension can be traced back mainly to the introduction of the measurement processes and the corresponding wave function reduction, which play a crucial role in Quantum Mechanics. We approach this problem within a recent proposal for a model of Quantum Mechanics, where the measurement is explicitly described as a specific stochastic process. This implements ordinary Quantum Mechanics, where measurement and reduction are treated as phenomenological events of unknown origin without any physical justification. To state clearly the question, we first discuss and establish the effect of a Lorentz transformation on a generic wave function in space-time. This allows to formulate the relativistic version of the model. We then consider few thought experiments in order to analyze to what extent Quantum Mechanics follows relativistic invariance and find the specific critical points where non invariance possibly occurs. The relevance of this analysis on the experimental observations is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subradiance is a phenomenon where coupled emitters radiate light at a slower rate than independent ones. While its observation was first reported in disordered cold atom clouds, ordered subwavelength arrays of emitters have emerged as promising platforms to design highly cooperative optical properties based on dipolar interactions. In this work we characterize the eigenmodes of 2D and 3D regular arrays, using a method which can be used for both infinite and very large systems. In particular, we show how finite-size effects impact the lifetimes of these large arrays. Our results may have interesting applications for quantum memories and topological effects in ordered atomic arrays.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithms for Particle Track Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computing is a rapidly developing field with the potential to tackle the increasing computational challenges faced in high-energy physics. In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of variational quantum algorithms in solving the particle track reconstruction problem. We present an analysis of two distinct formulations for identifying straight-line tracks in a multilayer detection system, inspired by the LHCb vertex detector. The first approach is formulated as a ground-state energy problem, while the second approach is formulated as a system of linear equations. This work addresses one of the main challenges when dealing with variational quantum algorithms on general problems, namely designing an expressive and efficient quantum ansatz working on tracking events with fixed detector geometry. For this purpose, we employed a quantum architecture search method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to design the quantum circuits for different problem sizes. We provide experimental results to test our approach on both formulations for different problem sizes in terms of performance and computational cost.</description>

Abstract: Ultrafast imaging of photon statistics in two dimensions is a powerful tool for probing non-equilibrium and transient optical phenomena, yet it remains experimentally challenging due to the simultaneous need for high temporal resolution and statistical fidelity. In this work, we demonstrate spatially resolved single-shot measurements of photon number distributions using difference-frequency generation (DFG) in a nonlinear BBO crystal. We show that our platform can discriminate between coherent and thermal photon statistics across two spatial dimensions with picosecond resolution. At the same time, we find that the retrieved distributions deviate from the ideal ones, a consequence of vacuum contamination and the multimodal response of the amplifier. To explain this, we develop a temporal mode decomposition framework that captures the essential physics of signal amplification and fluorescence, and quantitatively reproduces the experimental findings. This establishes a robust approach for measuring two-dimensional photon statistics while clarifying the fundamental factors that limit the fidelity of such measurements.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation with explicit formulas for Digital-Analog Quantum Computing</title>

Abstract: Digital-analog is a quantum computational paradigm that employs the natural interaction Hamiltonian of a system as the entangling resource, combined with single qubit gates, to implement universal quantum operations. As in the case of its digital gate-based counterpart, designing digital-analog circuits that employ optimal quantum resources often requires an exceedingly large classical computational time. In this work we find a suboptimal solution to this exponentially large problem, showing that it can be solved within polynomial computational time. In particular, we provide an exact solution for the problem of expressing arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians as the sum of local unitary transformations of an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian, with the total number of required terms being at most quadratic in system size. This allows us to design a digital-analog simulation protocol that avoids employing numerical optimization over a large parameter space at the preprocessing stage, minimizing computational resources and allowing for further scaling.</description>

      <title>Photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy of a B center in hBN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of solid-state quantum emitters for applications critically depends on several key figures of merit. One of the most important is the quantum coherence of the emitted single photons, which can be compromised by fast dephasing and spectral diffusion. In hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers (or B centers) are seen as favorable in this regard, in the light of prior studies mainly based on resonant excitation. Yet, their coherence properties in the more accessible regime of non-resonant excitation (or photoluminescence) has not been extensively characterized. Here, we investigate the coherence and spectral diffusion of the photoluminescence from a B center in the continuous wave regime using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy. We determine that the emission lineshape consists in a homogeneous contribution, whose linewidth increases with the laser power, and which is broadened by spectral diffusion at a timescale of 10 to 100 microseconds. At low power and short time, the emission line is only a factor ~2 above the Fourier limit, while at long times, the inhomogeneous linewidth increases up to more than a gigahertz. Our work deepens the understanding of decoherence processes of this preeminent family of quantum emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>TrackHHL: A Quantum Computing Algorithm for Track Reconstruction at the LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the future high-luminosity LHC era, high-energy physics experiments face unprecedented computational challenges for event reconstruction. Employing the LHCb vertex locator as a case study we investigate a novel approach for charged particle track reconstruction. The algorithm hinges on minimizing an Ising-like Hamiltonian using matrix inversion. Solving this matrix inversion classically achieves reconstruction efficiencies akin to current state-of-the-art algorithms. Exploiting the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm for linear systems holds the promise of an exponential speedup in the number of input hits over its classical counterpart, contingent on the conditions of efficient quantum phase estimation (QPE) and effectively reading out the algorithm's output. This contribution builds on previous work by Nicotra et al and strives to fulfill these conditions and further streamlines the algorithm's circuit depth by a factor up to $10^4$. Our version of the HHL algorithm restricts the QPE precision to one bit, largely reducing circuit depth and addressing HHL's readout issue. Furthermore, this allows for the implementation of a post-processing algorithm that reconstructs event Primary Vertices (PVs). The findings presented here aim to further illuminate the potential of harnessing quantum computing for the future of particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centres (NVs) are promising solid-state nanoscale quantum sensors for applications ranging from material science to biotechnology. Using multiple sensors simultaneously offers advantages for probing spatiotemporal correlations of fluctuating fields or the dynamics of point defects. In this work, by integrating NVs with foundry silicon-nitride photonic integrated circuits, we realise the scalable operation of eight localised NV sensors in an array, with simultaneous, distinct readout of the individual sensors. Using the eight NV sensors and machine-learning methods for multi-point magnetic field reconstruction, we demonstrate microscale magnetic localisation of a 30 $\mu$m-sized needle tip. Experimentally, the needle tip can be localised with an error below its dimension and tracked dynamically with high fidelity. We further simulate the feasibility of our platform for monitoring the position and orientation of magnetic microrobots designed for biological and clinical purposes. Without the complexity of bulk optics, our photonic-integrated multi-sensor platform presents a step towards real-life biomedical applications under out-of-the-lab conditions.</description>

      <title>Collective Enhancement of Photon Blockade via Two-Photon Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.</description>

      <title>Vector magnetometry using cavity-enhanced microwave readout in nitrogen-vacancy diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate $4\pi$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Transformer for Language Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories of gravity in which the metric is fundamentally classical predict stochastic fluctuations in the gravitational field. In this article, we study the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation as a starting point to understand the phenomenology of linearised classical-quantum hybrid gravity. In particular, we describe how to compute the non-equilibrium two point function of the scalar field, showing explicitly the role of the initial state in regulating divergences. To do so, we use a "mod-squared-retarded" pole-prescription and find that the covariance in the field is non-zero only outside the lightcone, scales inversely with the spatial distance of the spacetime points and grows linearly in time. The energy has a contact divergence similar to that found in the quantum case. We conclude by discussing possible implications of anomalous diffusion for hybrid theories of gravity, especially looking at the energy density in the predicted gravitational waves background, which can be inferred from the scalar covariances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ans\"atze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant parametric modulation is a major tool of studying magnetic systems. For a spin-1/2 chain in a strong magnetic field, the resulting excitations can be mapped on fermionic excitations in the Kitaev chain. We show that the response to the modulation turn-on allows one to reveal dynamical aspects of the nontrivial topology of the periodic chain. In the topological regime, depending on how fast the turn-on is, the system displays the absence of spatial magnetization correlations or their increase with the increasing detuning of the modulation from resonance. The transition between the topological and trivial regimes is controlled by the modulation frequency.</description>

      <title>Probing universal imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics with infinite projected entangled pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) with the full-update strategy. Simulating directly in the thermodynamic limit, we explore the relaxation process near the critical point with two types of initial states: a fully polarized state and a product state with a small magnetization. For the fully polarized state, the magnetization shows a power law scaling $M\propto \tau^{-\beta/(\nu z)}$ in the imaginary-time evolution, from which both the critical point and critical exponent can be determined with high accuracy. For the nearly paramagnetic state, the relaxation process exhibits a behavior of $M\propto \tau^\theta$ with $\theta=0.1958$ being the critical initial-slip exponent, which is in good agreement with that obtained from the dynamic scaling of the self-correlation in quantum Monte Carlo method. These universal features emerge well before the system converges to the ground state, demonstrating the efficiency of imaginary-time evolution for probing quantum criticality. Our results demonstrate that iPEPS can serve as a robust and scalable method for studying dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Cycle Basis Algorithms for Reducing Maximum Edge Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of constructing cycle bases of graphs with low maximum edge participation, defined as the maximum number of basis cycles that share any single edge. This quantity, though less studied than total weight or length, plays a critical role in quantum fault tolerance because it directly impacts the overhead of lattice surgery procedures used to implement an almost universal quantum gate set. Building on a recursive algorithm of Freedman and Hastings, we introduce a family of load-aware heuristics that adaptively select vertices and edges to minimize edge participation throughout the cycle basis construction. Our approach improves empirical performance on random regular graphs and on graphs derived from small quantum codes. We further analyze a simplified balls-into-bins process to establish lower bounds on edge participation. While the model differs from the cycle basis algorithm on real graphs, it captures what can be proven for our heuristics without using complex graph theoretic properties related to the distribution of cycles in the graph. Our analysis suggests that the maximum load of our heuristics grows on the order of (log n)^2. Our results indicate that careful cycle basis construction can yield significant practical benefits in the design of fault-tolerant quantum systems. This question also carries theoretical interest, as it is essentially identical to the basis number of a graph, defined as the minimum possible maximum edge participation over all cycle bases.</description>

      <title>Generalizing quantum dimensions: Symmetry-based classification of local pseudo-Hermitian systems and the corresponding domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conformal field theories (CFTs) and their classifications from a modern perspective based on the abstract algebraic formalism of symmetries or conserved charges, known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). By studying the algebraic structure of the SymTFTs in detail, we found a natural generalization of the quantum dimensions associated with (pseudo-)Hermitian systems and (non)-unitary CFTs. These generalized data of SymTFTs provide classifications of massless and massive renormalization group flows, which will describe the quantum phase transitions of the corresponding pseudo-Hermitian systems. Moreover, our discussions straightforwardly enable one to relate a general class of coset constructions or level-rank dualities to domain wall problems between topological quantum field theories (or a series of corresponding quantum phase transitions related to the Higgs mechanism). Our work provides a systematic reduction and classification of algebraic data, symmetries, for pseudo-Hermitian systems based on ideas from established mathematical fields, linear algebra and ring theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have emerged as leading candidates for next-generation quantum emitters, offering a unique combination of high photoluminescence quantum yield, tunable emission, short radiative lifetimes, and record-high single-photon purity under ambient conditions. These properties, together with low-cost and scalable solution-phase fabrication, position PNCs as attractive alternatives to traditional epitaxial and colloidal quantum dots. In this Review, we outline the physical parameters that define quantum emission in PNCs, compare their performance to other established and emerging quantum emitters, and assess the key figures of merit, including photostability, single-photon purity, and photon indistinguishability, required for practical quantum applications. We discuss underlying mechanisms affecting PNC emission behavior and highlight recent advances in improving their quantum emitting properties through synthetic and photonic engineering approaches. While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Clouds near Black Holes: Black Atoms and Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum mechanical wavefunctions near highly curved spaces, i.e., black holes. By utilizing the formalism developed by DeWitt, we derive the Schr\"odinger equations in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole geometries. The quantum electron cloud for the "black hydrogen atom" - an electron trapped by black holes - is particularly studied. We solve the equations and find that black holes generally attract the wavefunctions, localizing them near the horizon where the electrons are most likely to be trapped. These results imply that not only classical objects but also the quantum material and even the chemical properties of the atoms are affected by strong gravity. We also discuss black hydrogen molecules composed of multi-centered Majumdar-Papapetrou black holes.</description>

      <title>Topological states and flat bands in exactly solvable decorated Cayley trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the full spectrum of decorated Cayley trees that constitute tree analogs of selected two-dimensional Euclidean lattices; namely of the Lieb, the double Lieb, the kagome, and the star lattice. The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Solving a Nonlinear Eigenvalue Equation in Quantum Information Theory: A Hybrid Approach to Entanglement Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear eigenvalue equations arise naturally in quantum information theory, particularly in the variational quantification of entanglement. In this work, we present a hybrid analytical and numerical framework for evaluating the geometric measure of entanglement. The method combines a Gauss Seidel fixed point iteration with a controlled perturbative correction scheme. We make the coupled nonlinear eigenstructure explicit by proving the equal multiplier stationarity identity, which states that at the optimum all block Lagrange multipliers coincide with the squared fidelity between the target state and its closest separable approximation. A normalization-preserving linearization is then derived by projecting the dynamics onto the local tangent spaces, yielding a well-defined first order correction and an explicit scalar shift in the eigenvalue. Furthermore, we establish a monotonic block ascent property the squared overlap between the evolving product state and the target state increases at every iteration, remains bounded by unity, and converges to a stationary value. The resulting hybrid solver reproduces the exact optimum for standard three qubit benchmarks, obtaining squared-overlap values of one-half for the Greenberger Horne Zeilinger (GHZ\(_3\)) state and four-ninths for the W\(_3\) state, with smooth monotonic convergence.</description>

      <title>Scaling of free cumulants in closed system-bath setups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has been established as a cornerstone for understanding thermalization in quantum many-body systems. Recently, there has been growing interest in the full ETH, which extends the framework of the conventional ETH and postulates a smooth function to describe the multi-point correlations among matrix elements. Within this framework, free cumulants play a central role, and most previous studies have primarily focused on closed systems. In this paper, we extend the analysis to a system-bath setup, considering both an idealized case with a random-matrix bath and a more realistic scenario where the bath is modeled as a defect Ising chain. In both cases, we uncover a universal scaling of microcanonical free cumulants of system observables with respect to the interaction strength. Furthermore we establish a connection between this scaling behavior and the thermalization dynamics of the thermal free cumulants of corresponding observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tachyons are hypothetical particles that propagate faster than light, yet they have never been observed in nature or in the laboratory. In this work, we introduce the hydrogen molecule ion as an analogue for the dynamics of a spinless test particle interacting with the gravitational field generated by a tachyon. The tachyonic spacetime is modeled using an AII metric, and the problem is analyzed through the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field in this background. We compute the quasinormal modes and the Hawking radiation spectrum associated with the system. By introducing an external potential, we demonstrate that both the radial and angular components of the test particles wave function can be effectively reproduced by the electron dynamics in the hydrogen molecule ion, thus proposing a molecular analogue model for an extreme gravitational system.</description>

      <title>RF-Squad: A radiofrequency simulator for quantum dot arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spins in semiconductor quantum dots offer a scalable approach to quantum computing; however, precise control and efficient readout of large quantum dot arrays remain challenging, mainly due to the hyperdimensional voltage space required for tuning multiple gates per dot. To automate this process, large datasets are required for testing and training autotuning algorithms. To address the demand for such large datasets, we introduce RF-Squad, a physics-based simulator designed to realistically replicate radiofrequency (RF) reflectometry measurements of quantum dot arrays, with the ability to go beyond the Constant Interaction Model (CIM) and simulate physical phenomena such as tunnel coupling, tunnel rates, and quantum confinement. Implemented in JAX, an accelerated linear algebra library, RF-Squad achieves high computational speed, enabling the simulation of a 100x100 pixel charge stability diagram of a double quantum dot (DQD) in 52.1 $\pm$0.2 milliseconds at the CIM level. Using optimization algorithms, combined with it's layered architecture, RF-Squad allows users to balance physical accuracy with computational speed, scaling from simple to highly detailed models.</description>

Abstract: Variational methods play an important role in the study of quantum many-body problems, both in the flavor of classical variational principles based on tensor networks as well as of quantum variational principles in near-term quantum computing. This work stresses that for translationally invariant lattice Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions, one can easily derive efficiently computable lower bounds to ground state energies that can and should be compared with variational principles providing upper bounds. As small technical results, it is shown that (i) the Anderson bound and a (ii) common hierarchy of semi-definite relaxations both provide approximations with performance guarantees that scale like a constant in the energy density for cubic lattices. (iii) Also, the Anderson bound is systematically improved as a hierarchy of semi-definite relaxations inspired by the quantum marginal problem.</description>

      <title>Weak Value Advantage in Overcoming Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak value exhibits numerous intriguing characteristics, such as values outside the operator spectrum, leading to unexpected phenomena. Nevertheless, the measurement protocol used for measuring the weak value has been the subject of an on-going controversy. In particular, the possibility of gaining a metrological advantage using weak measurements was questioned. A rigorous characterization of this advantage when the primary system is noisy is still missing. We thus consider here the challenge of learning an unknown operator under the influence of noise on the primary system which could lead to bias in the results. For amplitude and phase damping noise channels, we prove that the weak value measurement protocol (WVMP) eliminates the bias to linear order, and this cannot be done with strong measurements. Since the WVMP makes use both of weak entanglement as well as postselection, one might suspect that the advantage is solely due to the postselection aspect of the WVMP. We prove that this is not the case, and that the same advantage of the WVMP is kept even over strong measurement protocols that are allowed to apply postselection. By this we rigorously prove for the first time the existence of settings in which the WVMP possesses a strict advantage in robustness to noise, even over strong measurements augemented with postselection. However, for some noise channels, we show that no advantage is exhibited once both measurement regimes are equipped with postselection.</description>

      <title>A Randomized Method for Simulating Lindblad Equations and Thermal State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06594v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a qDRIFT-type randomized method to simulate Lindblad dynamics by decomposing its generator into an ensemble of Lindbladians, $\mathcal{L} = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \mathcal{L}_a$, where each $\mathcal{L}_a$ comprises a simple Hamiltonian and a single jump operator. Assuming an efficient quantum simulation is available for the Lindblad evolution $e^{t\mathcal{L}_a}$, we implement $e^{t\mathcal{L}_a}$ for a randomly sampled $\mathcal{L}_a$ at each time step according to a probability distribution $\mu$ over the ensemble $\{\mathcal{L}_a\}_{a \in \mathcal{A}}$. This randomized strategy reduces the quantum cost of simulating Lindblad dynamics, particularly in quantum many-body systems with a large or even infinite number of jump operators.
  Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed randomized method, covering both average and typical algorithmic realizations. This analysis extends the known results for the random product formula from closed systems to open systems, ensuring rigorous performance guarantees. Second, based on the random product approximation, we derive a new quantum Gibbs sampler algorithm that utilizes jump operators sampled from a Clifford-random circuit. This generator (i) can be efficiently implemented using our randomized algorithm, and (ii) exhibits a spectral gap lower bound that depends on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Our results present a new instance of a class of Hamiltonians for which the thermal states can be efficiently prepared using a quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>The advent of fully variational quantum eigensolvers using a hybrid multiresolution approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electronic structure theory, variational methods offer a valuable paradigm for approximating electronic ground states. However, for historical reasons, this principle is mostly restricted to model chemistries in pre-defined fixed basis sets. Especially in quantum computation, these model chemistries are far from an accurate description of the initial electronic Hamiltonian. This work demonstrates a \textit{fully} variational approach to the electronic structure problem by optimizing the orbitals that represent the second-quantized Hamiltonian, alongside a quantum circuit that generates the many-electron wavefunction. To this end, the orbitals are represented within an adaptive multi-wavelet format, guaranteeing numerical precision. We then present explicit numerical protocols and highlight the quantum circuit's role in determining the optimal orbital basis.</description>

Abstract: The dependence of the magnetic fluctuations and the spin coherence time $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ of the lowest Stark states $^4I_{15/2}\ (Z_1)$ in $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ under zero magnetic field on Er concentration is numerically investigated in the range of 10 to 100 parts per million (ppm). We investigate two primary sources of magnetic fluctuation limiting spin coherence: a constant contribution from host Y nuclei and a concentration-dependent component from dipole-dipole interactions among Er ions. Due to these two components, the Er-concentration dependence of $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ at the zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) points saturates for crystals with Er concentration below 10 ppm and no extension of the $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ is expected without an external magnetic field. Under a magnetic field, the longest $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ at a particular ZEFOZ point is expected to be over 170 s (90 s) for site 1 (site 2), which is more than $10^4$ times longer than that at zero field for 10-ppm $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. Remarkably, these optimal ZEFOZ points form striking geometric patterns: a line for site 1 and a plane for site 2. This trend, which is favorable for experiments, can be explained by the anisotropy of the effective spin Hamiltonian parameters. Finally, the tolerance of the ZEFOZ point at each site with the longest $T_2^{\rm hyp}$ against the errors in the applied magnetic field vector is evaluated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing employs fixed quantum dynamics as a feature map for machine learning. Integrating multiple quantum reservoirs, however, raises a key question: how few inter-module connections are sufficient to match the performance of a single reservoir? To address this, we explicitly separate intra-module dynamics from inter-module couplings and systematically examine different connectivity schemes. We find that even a small number of well-placed connections between two modules can match single-reservoir accuracy, with simple one-to-one connections proving highly effective. Performance generally improves with increasing inter-module entanglement, and these correlations persist for both $ZZ$-coupled and random modular reservoirs. Extensions to three modules and evaluations across multiple datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) suggest that the modular architecture can be applied to diverse reservoir types and image-classification datasets. These results motivate modular quantum reservoir designs that align naturally with realistic hardware, such as two-dimensional quantum-chip layouts or networks of small integrated quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: In signal processing, resampling algorithms can modify the number of resources encoding a collection of data points. Downsampling reduces the cost of storage and communication, while upsampling interpolates new data from limited one, e.g. when resizing a digital image. We present a toolset of quantum algorithms to resample data encoded in the probabilities of a quantum register, using the quantum Fourier transform to adjust the number of high-frequency encoding qubits. We discuss advantage over classical resampling algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We present a classical algorithm for approximating the expectation values of observables in linear-optical circuits with arbitrary product input states, achieving additive-error accuracy. This result indicates that current applications of photonic systems aimed at demonstrating practical quantum supremacy through expectation value estimation, such as photonic variational algorithms, may face challenges in attaining the computational advantage. It also implies the output probabilities of boson sampling with arbitrary product input states can be efficiently approximated by our method, resulting that boson sampling becomes efficiently simulable when its output probability distribution is polynomially sparse. We also develop an efficient classical algorithm for estimating transition amplitudes of arbitrary product states in linear-optical circuits. This provides additive-error approximation algorithms for matrix functions associated with linear-optical circuits, such as the (loop-)hafnian, which are of independent interest. As an application, it solves the generalized molecular vibronic spectra problem (Oh et al., 2024), previously suggested as a candidate for practical quantum advantage. Finally, we extend our framework to near-Clifford circuits, enabling classical approximation of their expectation values.</description>

Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum low-density parity-check codes for erasure-biased atomic quantum processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the best families of quantum error correction (QEC) codes for near-term experiments is key to enabling fault-tolerant quantum computing. Ideally, such codes should have low overhead in qubit number, high physical error thresholds, and moderate requirements on qubit connectivity to simplify experiments, while allowing for high logical error suppression. Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes have been recently shown to provide a path towards QEC with low qubit overhead and small logical error probabilities. Here, we demonstrate that when the dominant errors are erasures -- as can be engineered in different quantum computing architectures -- quantum LDPC codes additionally provide high thresholds and even stronger logical error suppression in parameter regimes that are accessible to current experiments. Using large-scale QEC numerical simulations, we benchmark the performance of two families of high-rate quantum LDPC codes, namely Clifford-deformed La-cross codes and Bivariate Bicycle codes, under a noise model strongly biased towards erasure errors. Both codes outperform the surface code by offering up to orders of magnitude lower logical error probabilities. Interestingly, we find that this decrease in the logical error probability may not be accompanied by an increase in the code threshold, as different QEC codes benefit differently from large erasure fractions. While here we focus on neutral atom qubits, the results also hold for other quantum platforms, such as trapped ions and superconducting qubits, for which erasure conversion has been demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: We present Schmidt decomposition formulas for mutually orthogonal two-qubit pure states and classify orthonormal sets based on their entanglement structure. First, we derive explicit Schmidt decomposition formulas for any pure state and extend them to two orthogonal pure states. For three mutually orthogonal states, we provide formulas for specific cases and discuss the challenges of obtaining analytic expressions for the rest. Additionally, we derive explicit formulas for certain orthonormal bases and analyze those containing one or two maximally entangled states. Finally, we prove that no orthonormal basis can consist of three product states and one entangled state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-distance quantum communication necessitates the use of quantum repeaters, which typically include highly coherent quantum memories. We provide a theoretical analysis of the secret key rates for a quantum repeater system incorporating bosonic error correction and memory components. Specifically, we focus on the application of Binomial codes for two repeater segments. Using these codes, our investigation aims to suppress memory loss errors that commonly affect systems such as atoms and microwave cavities, in contrast to dephasing errors in single-spin memories. We further discuss a physical implementation of such a quantum repeater comprising a microwave cavity and a superconducting transmon, capable of state engineering with high fidelities ($&gt;97\%$) and logical Bell state measurements for successful entanglement swapping. As an alternative approach, we also discuss a realization in the all-optical domain.</description>

      <title>Quantum Incompatibility in Parallel vs Antiparallel Spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the joint measurability of incompatible qubit observables on ensembles of parallel and antiparallel spin-1/2 pairs. In parallel configuration, both spins are prepared in the same state, whereas in antiparallel case, each spin is paired with its flipped counterpart. We show that the antiparallel configuration uniquely enables the exact simultaneous prediction of three mutually orthogonal spin components-an advantage not achievable with parallel states. Extending beyond three observables, we examine joint measurability for larger sets of spin measurements and further generalize our analysis to state configurations beyond the parallel and antiparallel cases. As we show, our results reveal a deep connection to the 'mean King retrodiction task' proposed by Vaidman, Aharonov, and Albert, and have implications for a cryptographic protocol introduced by Jeffrey Bub. We further demonstrate how the enhanced compatibility in the antiparallel configuration can facilitate efficient estimation of unknown measurement devices. Finally, we discuss prospects for experimentally realizing the enhanced measurement compatibility in antiparallel configuration by analyzing the effect on finite sub-ensembles of states.</description>

      <title>Stable and Efficient Charging of Superconducting Capacitively Shunted Flux Quantum Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, as miniature energy storage devices, have sparked significant research interest in recent years. However, achieving rapid and stable energy transfer in quantum batteries while obeying quantum speed limits remains a critical challenge. In this work, we experimentally optimize the charging process by leveraging the unique energy level structure of a superconducting capacitively-shunted flux qubit, using counterdiabatic pulses in the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. Compared to previous studies, we impose two different norm constraints on the driving Hamiltonian, achieving optimal charging without exceeding the overall driving strength. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a charging process that achieves the quantum speed limit. In addition, we introduce a dimensionless parameter $\mathcal{S}$ to unify charging speed and stability, offering a universal metric for performance optimization. In contrast to metrics such as charging power and thermodynamic efficiency, the $\mathcal{S}$ criterion quantitatively captures the stability of ergentropy while also considering the charging speed. Our results highlight the potential of the capacitively-shunted qubit platform as an ideal candidate for realizing three-level quantum batteries and deliver novel strategies for optimizing energy transfer protocols.</description>

      <title>Bounds in Sequential Unambiguous Discrimination of Multiple Pure Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential methods for quantum hypothesis testing offer significant advantages over fixed-length approaches, which rely on a predefined number of state copies. Despite their potential, these methods remain underexplored for unambiguous discrimination. In this work, we derive performance bounds for such methods when applied to the discrimination of a set of pure states. The performance is evaluated based on the expected number of copies required. We establish a lower bound applicable to any sequential method and an upper bound on the optimal sequential method. The upper bound is derived using a novel and simple non-adaptive method. Importantly, the gap between these bounds is minimal, scaling logarithmically with the number of distinct states.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization, shadowing breakdown, and the absence of Trotterization transition in quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of premier utilities of present day noisy quantum computers is simulation of many-body quantum systems. We study how long in time is such a discrete-time simulation representative of a continuous time Hamiltonian evolution, namely, a finite time-step introduces so-called Trotterization errors. We show that the truncated operator propagator (Ruelle-Pollicott resonances) is a powerful tool to that end, as well as to study prethermalization and discrete time crystals, including finding those phenomena at large gate duration. We show that the effective energy is more stable than suggested by Trotter errors -- a manifestation of prethermalization -- while all other observables are not. Even the most stable observable though deteriorates in the thermodynamic limit. Different than in classical systems with the strongest chaos, where the faithfulness time (the shadowing time) can be infinite, in quantum many-body chaotic systems it is finite. A corollary of our results is also that, opposite to previous claims, there is no Trotterization transition in non-integrable many-body quantum systems. We demonstrate our results on a one-dimensional (1d) kicked Ising model, as well as on 1d kicked XX model and 2d kicked Ising model. The truncated propagator is also used to calculate the energy diffusion constant in the tilted-field Ising model with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum resources in resource management systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing resources are increasingly being incorporated into high-performance computing (HPC) environments as co-processors for hybrid workloads. To support this paradigm, quantum devices must be treated as schedulable first-class resources within existing HPC infrastructure. This enables consistent workload management, unified resource visibility, and support for hybrid quantum-classical job execution models.
  This paper presents a reference architecture and implementation for the integration of quantum computing resources, both on-premises and cloud-hosted into HPC centers via standard workload managers. We introduce a Slurm plugin designed to abstract and control quantum backends, enabling seamless resource scheduling, minimizing queue duplication, and supporting job co-scheduling with classical compute nodes. The architecture supports heterogeneous quantum resources and can be extended to any workload (and container) management systems.</description>

      <title>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time crystals constitute a novel phase of matter defined by the spontaneous breaking of timetranslation symmetry. Here we present a scheme to realize a continuous-time crystal of the vibrational phonon in the normal mode of two coupled ultra-cold ions. By utilizing two addressable standing-wave lasers and adiabatic elimination method, we generate a controllable nonlinear phonon mode with the well-designed efficient linear gain and nonlinear damping. By controlling these parameters to satisfy the phase transition conditions of Hopf bifurcation and limit cycle phase, it behaves as a stable dissipative dynamics over timescales significantly longer than the oscillation period, indicating the emergence of discrete time-translation symmetry breaking in the phonon mode, i.e., a phonon time crystal. We further numerically simulate this phonon time crystal by using accessible experimental parameters and also demonstrate a robustness to the initial thermal state and thermalization of phonon mode, spin dephasing, and the control errors of Rabi frequencies. These results provide a practical scheme for observing a time crystal in a nonlinear phonon mode and will advance the research of time crystals.</description>

      <title>Violation of local realism with spatially multimode parametric down-conversion pumped by spatially incoherent light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a violation of local realism with highly spatially multimode polarization-entangled two-photon states produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) pumped by a spatially incoherent light source-a light-emitting diode (LED). While existing studies have observed such a violation only by post-selecting the LED-pumped SPDC photons into a single spatial detection mode, we achieve a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S = 2.532 \pm 0.069 &gt; 2$ using a spatially multimode detection setup that collects nearly 4,080 SPDC spatial modes. These results indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for SPDC-based entanglement generation. Our work could enable novel and practical sources of entangled photons for quantum technologies such as device-independent quantum key distribution and quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13202v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how unitary control can improve parameter estimation by designing the effective spectrum of the imprinting Hamiltonian. We show that, for commuting Hamiltonians, the general problem of spectral manipulation via unitary control simplifies to a finite sequence of elementary switching operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any desired relative spacing of energy levels can be achieved, although this may come at the cost of a reduced spectral range. We also show that any modified spectrum can be expressed as a convex combination of the original eigenvalues, with the convex weights forming a bi-stochastic matrix. Through several single-parameter estimation examples, we demonstrate that our spectral engineering method substantially enhances estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Context-Dependent Time-Energy Uncertainty Relations from Projective Quantum Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot \delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing quantum timing in controlled measurements.</description>

Abstract: We construct several explicit instances of quantum Tanner codes, a class of asymptotically good quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes. The codes are constructed using dihedral groups and random pairs of classical codes and exhibit high encoding rates, relative distances, and pseudo-thresholds. Using the BP+OSD decoder, we demonstrate good performance in the phenomenological and circuit-level noise settings, comparable to the surface code with similar distances. Finally, we conduct an analysis of the space-time overhead incurred by these codes.</description>

      <title>Engineering of maximally entangled orbital angular momentum states via path identity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cutting-edge quantum technologies lean on sources of high-dimensional entangled states (HDES) that reliably prepare high-fidelity target states. The idea to overlap photon paths from distinct but indistinguishable sources was recently introduced for the creation of HDES, known as entanglement by path identity. In this regard, the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes is promising, as they offer a high-dimensional and discrete Hilbert space to encode information. While entanglement by path identity with OAM has been verified experimentally, a detailed investigation of how the OAM distribution of photon pairs can be engineered to maximize the entanglement is lacking. We address this gap and identify an optimal dimensionality for maximally entangled states (MESs) when the spatial engineering of the pump beam and the path identity approach are combined. Our theoretical study reveals notable limitations for the fidelity of high-dimensional target states. We also establish the equivalence of entangled biphoton states pumped by a spatially engineered beam and generated via path identity. These findings constitute a valuable step toward the optimized preparation of MESs in high dimensions.ngineered beam. These findings constitute a valuable step toward the optimized preparation of MESs in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of the role of spatial correlations in optical integration with heralded single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21161v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate optical integration using heralded single photons and explore the influence of spatial correlations between photons on this process. Specifically, we experimentally harness the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light within an optical processing framework based on heralded single photons. The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model. This connection underscores the potential of our approach for quantum-enhanced information processing, even in regimes where entanglement is minimal or absent.</description>

      <title>Boosting Sparsity in Graph Decompositions with QAOA Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of decomposing a graph into a weighted sum of a small number of matchings, a task that arises in network resource allocation problems such as peer-to-peer energy exchange. Computing such decompositions is challenging for classical algorithms, even for small instances. To address this problem, we propose E-FCFW, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on the Fully-Corrective Frank-Wolfe (FCFW) algorithm that incorporates a matching-sampling subroutine. We design a QAOA version of this subroutine and benchmark it against classical approaches (random sampling and simulated annealing) on demand graphs derived from complete, bipartite, and heavy-hex topologies. The quantum subroutine is executed using the Qiskit Aer state-vector and MPS simulators and on IBM Kingston hardware (7-111 qubits). On complete and bipartite graphs with 6-10 nodes, E-FCFW with QAOA yields consistently sparser decompositions than the classical baselines, and even beats the best-known solution for one instance. On heavy-hex graphs with 50, 70 and 100 nodes, E-FCFW with QAOA outperforms the other methods in terms of approximation error, demonstrating performance on utility-scale quantum hardware. For the largest graphs (100 nodes) E-FCFW with QAOA performs much better when using MPS circuit simulation, compared to using quantum hardware. This indicates that at this scale, the performance is severely impacted by hardware noise.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Nonlinear Electromagnetic Fluid Dynamics via Koopman-von Neumann Linearization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To simulate plasma phenomena, large-scale computational resources have been employed in developing high-precision and high-resolution plasma simulations. One of the main obstacles in plasma simulations is the requirement of computational resources that scale polynomially with the number of spatial grids, which poses a significant challenge for large-scale modeling. To address this issue, this study presents a quantum algorithm for simulating the nonlinear electromagnetic fluid dynamics that govern space plasmas. We map it, by applying Koopman-von Neumann linearization, to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and evolve the system using Hamiltonian simulation via quantum singular value transformation. Our algorithm scales $O \left(s N_x \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) T \right)$ in time complexity with $s$, $N_x$, and $T$ being the spatial dimension, the number of spatial grid points per dimension, and the evolution time, respectively. Comparing the scaling $O \left( s N_x^s \left(T^{5/4}+T N_x\right) \right)$ for the classical method with the finite volume scheme, this algorithm achieves polynomial speedup in $N_x$. The space complexity of this algorithm is exponentially reduced from $O\left( s N_x^s \right)$ to $O\left( s \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) \right)$. Numerical experiments validate that accurate solutions are attainable with smaller $m$ than theoretically anticipated and with practical values of $m$ and $R$, underscoring the feasibility of the approach. As a practical demonstration, the method accurately reproduces the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, underscoring its capability to tackle more intricate nonlinear dynamics. These results suggest that quantum computing can offer a viable pathway to overcome the computational barriers of multiscale plasma modeling.</description>

      <title>Offline Dedicated Quantum Attacks on Block Ciphers Constructions Based on Two Parallel Permutation-Based Pseudorandom Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cryptanalysis is essential for evaluating the security of cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computing. Recently, Shi {\it et al.} introduced a dedicated quantum attack on block cipher constructions based on XOR-type functions, which greatly reduces the required resources (including circuit depth, width, and the number of gates) compared to the parallel Grover-meets-Simon algorithm. Here, our contribution is in two aspects. On the one hand, we discover new cryptographic structures amenable to this attack: PolyMAC and constructions based on two parallel permutation-based pseudorandom functions (TPP-PRFs), including XopEM, SoEM22, SUMPIP, and DS-SoEM, thereby answering Shi {\it et al.}'s open question. On the other hand, for constructions based on TPP-PRFs, we break the obstacle that this attack relies on online query by constructing decoupled XOR-type functions, then propose an offline quantum attack on them. Compared to previous results, our offline attack exhibits significantly reduced query complexity. Specifically, the number of queries to the encryption oracle is reduced from $O(2^{(n+t)/2}\cdot (n-t))$ to $O(2^{t}\cdot (n-t))$ in the quantum query model, where $0&lt;t&lt;n$, $t$ is a truncation parameter, and $n$ is the input length of constructions. Further, we enable its implementation in the classical query model, optimizing both the classical query complexity and time complexity from $\tilde O(2^{2n/3})$ to $\tilde O(2^{(2n-t)/3})$.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of frequency-entangled biphoton states facilitated by cavity polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regimes. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how the interaction of the entangled photon pair with the polariton/bipolariton modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We suggest that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity state.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the steady-state phases of the one-dimensional quantum contact process model. We present the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit and uncover the metastability of the system. Exploiting the mean-field approximations with a novel self-consistent condition based on the effective field, we capture the avoid the interference of the metastable state. We show the feature of saddle-node bifurcation of the order parameter revealing the discontinuous phase transition of the steady state and extract the transition point for infinite-size system. We show the monotonic decreasing of the steady-state magnetic susceptibility by the linked-cluster expansion, which does not support the divergence of the correlation length at the vicinity of the transition point. The present results may be tested in the quantum simulator of Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>The Converse Madelung Question</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pose the converse Madelung question: not whether Fisher information can reproduce quantum mechanics, but whether it is necessary. We work with minimal, physically motivated axioms on density and phase: locality, probability conservation, Euclidean invariance with a global phase symmetry, reversibility, and convex regularity. Within the resulting class of first order local Hamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson bracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for local hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change of variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show that the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional of the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is exactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional. When its coefficient equals Planck constant squared divided by twice the mass, the dynamics reduce to the linear Schrodinger equation. For many body systems, a single local complex structure across sectors enforces the same relation species by species, fixing a single Planck constant. Galilean covariance appears through the Bargmann central extension, with the usual superselection consequences. Comparison with the Doebner and Goldin family identifies the reversible zero diffusion corner with linear Schrodinger dynamics. We provide operational falsifiers via residual diagnostics for the continuity and Hamilton Jacobi equations and report numerical minima at the Fisher scale that are invariant under Galilean boosts. In this setting, quantum mechanics emerges as a reversible fixed point of Fisher regularised information hydrodynamics. A code archive enables direct numerical checks, including a superposition stress test that preserves exact projective linearity within our axioms.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Braiding of Anyons in Chern Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences using one and two impurities, the protocol gives independent access to the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, thereby providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional quantum central limit theorem by quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak limit theorem (WLT), the quantum analogue of the central limit theorem, is foundational to quantum walk (QW) theory. Unlike the universal Gaussian limit of classical walks, deriving analytical forms of the limiting probability density function (PDF) in higher dimensions has remained a challenge since the 1D Konno distribution was established. Previous explicit PDFs for 2D models were limited to specific cases whose fundamental nature was unclear.
  This paper resolves this long-standing gap by introducing the notion of maximal speed $v_{\mathrm{max}}$ as a critical parameter. We demonstrate that all previous 2D solutions correspond to a degenerate regime where $v_{\mathrm{max}} = 1$. We then present the first exact analytical representation of the limiting PDF for the physically richer, unexplored regime $v_{\mathrm{max}} &lt; 1$ of a general class of 2D two-state QWs.
  Our result reveals 2D Konno functions that govern these dynamics. We establish these as the proper 2D generalization of the 1D Konno distribution by demonstrating their convergence to the 1D form in the appropriate limit. Furthermore, our derivation, based on spectral analysis of the group velocity map, analytically resolves the singular asymptotic structure: we explicitly determine the caustics loci where the PDF diverges and prove they define the boundaries of the distribution's support. By also providing a closed-form expression for the weight functions, this work offers a complete description of the 2D WLT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the necessary features of the pair interaction for the stabilization of self-assembled quantum quasicrystals in two-dimensional bosonic systems. Unlike the classical scenario, our results show that two-dimensional octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal aperiodic phases require a distinct number of properly tuned characteristic length scales for their stabilization. By using a mean field spectral variational approach and Gross-Pitaevskii numerical calculations, we determine that the dodecagonal quasicrystal structure requires at least two characteristic length scales for its stabilization, while the decagonal and octagonal patterns need at least three and four length scales, respectively. The family of pair interaction potentials considered, albeit simple, is well justified in terms of a novel experimental platform based on laser-painted interactions in a cavity QED setup. Finally, we perform a structural characterization of the quasicrystal patterns obtained and show that these phases coexist with a finite superfluid fraction, forming what can be called a super quasicrystal phase.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a boundary condition twisted by time translation as a novel probe to characterize dynamical phases in periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems. Inspired by twisted boundary conditions in equilibrium systems, this approach modifies the temporal evolution of the system upon completing a spatial loop, enabling the identification of distinct Floquet phases, including discrete time crystals (DTCs). By studying the spectral form factor (SFF) and its response to the twist, we uncover signatures of time-crystalline order, which exhibits periodic dependence on the twist parameter analogous to the Little-Parks effect in superconductors. We apply this framework to the kicked Ising model, demonstrating that our twist can distinguish time-crystalline phases.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for mapping \textit{in situ} the spatial distribution of photon momentum across a laser beam using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a moving probe. By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$ wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local \textit{extra recoil} effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged) fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW (self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation in Kitaev Chain</title>

Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.</description>

      <title>The Anderson transition -- a view from Krylov space</title>

Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.</description>

      <title>Structure and interactions of atoms and diatomic molecules: from ultracold gases to doped solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009. The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena, like photoassociation and collisional shielding.</description>
