      <title>A mathematical analysis of IPT-DMFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical analysis of the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, a celebrated representative of a class of approximations in quantum mechanics known as embedding methods. We start by a pedagogical and self-contained mathematical formulation of the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory equations for the finite Hubbard model. After recalling the definition and properties of one-body time-ordered Green's functions and self-energies, and the mathematical structure of the Hubbard and Anderson impurity models, we describe a specific impurity solver, namely the Iterated Perturbation Theory solver, which can be conveniently formulated using Matsubara's Green's functions. Within this framework, we prove under certain assumptions that the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory equations admit a solution for any set of physical parameters. Moreover, we establish some properties of the solution(s).</description>

      <title>On equivalence of gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several approaches to formulate gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin field in $d$ dimensions including the following: (i) in terms of symmetric tensor fields $\phi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, with $k = s, s-1, \dots , 0$, restricted to be double traceless for $k\geq 4$; and (ii) in terms of a quartet of $traceful$ symmetric tensor fields $\psi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, of rank $k=s,s-1,s-2, s-3$. We demonstrate that these formulations in Minkowski space ${\mathbb M}^d$ are equivalent to the gauge-invariant theory for a massive integer-spin field proposed in 1989 by Pashnev. We also make use of the Klishevich-Zinoviev theory in ${\mathbb M}^d$ to derive a generalisation of the Singh-Hagen model for a massive integer-spin field in $d&gt;4 $ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct new conserved quasi-local energies in general relativity using the formalism developed by \cite{CWY}. In particular, we use the optimal isometric embedding defined in \cite{yau,yau1} to transplant the conformal Killing fields of the Minkowski space back to the $ 2-$ surface of interest in the physical spacetime. For an asymptotically flat spacetime of order $1$, we show that these energies are always finite. Their limit as the total energies of an isolated system is evaluated and a conservation law under Einsteinian evolution is deduced.</description>

      <title>Knotted 4-regular graphs II: Consistent application of the Pachner moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common choice for the evolution of the knotted graphs in loop quantum gravity is to use the Pachner moves, adapted to graphs from their dual triangulations. Here, we show that the natural way to consistently use these moves is on framed graphs with edge twists, where the Pachner moves can only be performed when the twists, and the vertices the edges are incident on, meet certain criteria. For other twists, one can introduce an algebraic object, which allow any knotted graph with framed edges to be written in terms of a generalized braid group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries of Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the number of relevant considerations in the literature, the algebra of generalized symmetries of the Burgers equation has not been exhaustively described. We fill this gap, presenting a basis of this algebra in an explicit form and proving that the two well-known recursion operators of the Burgers equation and two seed generalized symmetries, which are evolution forms of its Lie symmetries, suffice to generate this algebra. The core of the proof is essentially simplified by using the original technique of choosing special coordinates in the associated jet space.</description>

      <title>On support sets of the critical Liouville Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fractal properties of support sets of the critical Liouville Quantum Gravity (cLQG) associated with the Gaussian Free Field in planar domains. Specifically, we completely characterize the gauge functions $\phi$ (subject to mild monotonicity conditions) for which the cLQG admits a support set of finite $\phi$-Hausdorff measure. As a corollary, we settle the conjecture that the cLQG is supported on a set of vanishing Hausdorff dimension. Our proofs are based on the fact that the cLQG describes the near-critical level sets of Discrete Gaussian Free Field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is concerned with weakly interacting stochastic particle systems with possibly singular pairwise interactions. In this setting, we observe a connection between entropic propagation of chaos and exponential concentration bounds for the empirical measure of the system. In particular, we establish a variational upper bound for the probability of a certain rare event, and then use this upper bound to show that "controlled" entropic propagation of chaos implies an exponential concentration bound for the empirical measure. This connection allows us to infer concentration bounds for a class of singular stochastic systems through a simple adaptation of the arguments developed in Jabin and Wang (2018).</description>

      <title>Collapse of the Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3_2$-models on the infinite volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\Phi^3_2$-measure in the infinite volume limit. This is the invariant measure for several stochastic partial differential equations including the parabolic and hyperbolic $\Phi^3_2$-models. In the large torus limit, we observe a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around zero, which is the single minimizer of the corresponding Hamiltonian for any fixed torus size. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we obtain a triviality result for the $\Phi^3_2$-measure on infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>

      <title>Effective short distance interaction in Calogero-Sutherland quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effective conformal field theory with symmetry W-infinity x W-infinity that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model. In the repulsive regime of the free fermion formulation, we identify an attractive interaction between opposite moving particle-hole pairs that dominates the short distance behavior and that is proposed as responsible for the destabilization of the ground state, leading to a new one of bosonic nature. The process is described by a Bogoliubov transformation of the free fermion bilinear operators into bosonic ones, preserving the form of the W-infinity algebra but decoupling the opposite chirality terms in the hamiltonian, as expected in the low energy limit. In coordinate space this interaction has a short range component that arises due to the quantum regularization of the theory. The described dynamical process may be considered as a mechanism of the emergence of the known charge and quantum statistics fractionalization of the low lying excitations of the theory, as predicted in both first and second quantization studies.</description>

      <title>Analytical Survival Analysis of the Non-autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The survival probability for a periodic non-autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is calculated analytically using two different methods. The first uses an asymptotic approach. We treat the associated Kolmogorov Backward Equation with an absorbing boundary by dividing the domain into an interior region, centered around the origin, and a "boundary layer" near the absorbing boundary. In each region we determine the leading-order analytical solutions, and construct a uniformly valid solution over the entire domain using asymptotic matching. In the second method we examine the integral relationship between the probability density function and the mean first passage time probability density function. These allow us to determine approximate analytical forms for the exit rate. The validity of the solutions derived from both methods is assessed numerically, and we find the asymptotic method to be superior.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Born Rule from Microscopic Models with Non-convex Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.13564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gradient field models on an integer lattice with non-convex interactions. These models emerge in distinct branches of physics and mathematics under various names. In particular, as zero-mass lattice (Euclidean) quantum field theory, models of random interfaces, and as mass-string models of nonlinear elasticity.Our attention is mostly devoted to the latter with random vector valued fields as displacements for atoms of crystal structures,where our aim is to prove the strict convexity of the free energy as a function of affine deformations for low enough temperatures and small enough deformations. This claim can be interpreted as a form of verification of the Cauchy-Born rule at small non-vanishing temperatures for a class of these models. We also show that the scaling limit of the Laplace transform of the corresponding Gibbs measure (under a proper rescaling) corresponds to the Gaussian gradient field with a particular covariance.
  The proofs are based on a multi-scale (renormalisation group analysis) techniques needed in view of strong correlations of studied gradient fields. To cover sufficiently wide class of models, we extend these techniques from the standard case with rotationally symmetric nearest neighbour interaction to a more general situation with finite range interactions without any symmetry. Our presentation is entirely self-contained covering the details of the needed renormalisation group methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems in a finite volume in equilibrium are often described by a grand canonical ensemble induced by the corresponding Hamiltonian, i.e. a finite volume Gibbs measure. However, in practice, directly measuring this Hamiltonian is not possible, as such, methods need to be developed to calculate the Hamiltonian potentials from measurable data. In this work we give an expansion of the chemical potential in terms of the correlation functions of such a system in the thermodynamic limit. This is a justification of a formal approach of Nettleton and Green from the 50's.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of soliton lengths in a multicolor box-ball system</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.04458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball systems are integrable cellular automata whose long-time behavior is characterized by soliton solutions, with rich connections to other integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, we consider a multicolor box-ball system with two types of random initial configurations and obtain sharp scaling limits of the soliton lengths as the system size tends to infinity. We obtain a sharp scaling limit of soliton lengths that turns out to be more delicate than that in the single color case established in [Levine, Lyu, Pike '20]. A large part of our analysis is devoted to studying the associated carrier process, which is a multi-dimensional Markov chain on the orthant, whose excursions and running maxima are closely related to soliton lengths. We establish the sharp scaling of its ruin probabilities, Skorokhod decomposition, strong law of large numbers, and weak diffusive scaling limit to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion with explicit parameters. We also establish and utilize complementary descriptions of the soliton lengths and numbers in terms of modified Greene-Kleitman invariants for the box-ball systems and associated circular exclusion processes.</description>

      <title>Classification of symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$ symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$, $p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth Fano variety. We attach a bi-graded associative algebra $\mathrm{HS}(\mathcal{K}u(X))=\bigoplus_{i,j\in \mathbb{Z}} \mathrm{Hom}(\mathrm{Id},S_{\mathcal{K}u(X)}^{i}[j])$ to the Kuznetsov component $\mathcal{K}u(X)$ whenever it is defined. Then we construct a natural sub-algebra of $\mathrm{HS}(\mathcal{K}u(X))$ when $X$ is a Fano hypersurface and establish its relation with Jacobian ring $\mathrm{Jac}(X)$. As an application, we prove a categorical Torelli theorem for Fano hypersurface $X\subset\mathbb{P}^n(n\geq 2)$ of degree $d$ if $\mathrm{gcd}(n+1,d)=1.$ In addition, we give a new proof of the $[Pir22, Theorem 1.2]$ using a similar idea.</description>

      <title>Haar-random and pretty good measurements for Bayesian state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Haar-random bases and pretty good measurement for Bayesian state estimation. Given $N$ Haar-random bases we derive a bound on fidelity averaged over IID sequences of such random measurements for a uniform ensemble of pure states. For ensembles of mixed qubit states, we find that measurements defined through unitary 2-designs closely approximate those defined via Haar random unitaries while the Pauli group only gives a weak lower bound. For a single-shot-update, we show using the Petz recovery map for pretty good measurement that it can give pretty good Bayesian mean estimates.</description>

      <title>Intertwinings for Continuum Particle Systems: an Algebraic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the algebraic approach to duality, more precisely to intertwinings, within the context of particle systems in general spaces, focusing on the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ current algebra. We introduce raising, lowering, and neutral operators indexed by test functions and we use them to construct unitary operators, which act as self-intertwiners for some Markov processes having the Pascal process's law as a reversible measure. We show that such unitaries relate to generalized Meixner polynomials. Our primary results are continuum counterparts of results in the discrete setting obtained by Carinci, Franceschini, Giardin\`a, Groenevelt, and Redig (2019).</description>

      <title>Hadamard integrators for wave equations in time and frequency domain: Eulerian formulations via butterfly algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation and Duhamel's principle of time-domain wave equations, we propose novel butterfly-compressed Hadamard integrators for self-adjoint wave equations in both time and frequency domain in an inhomogeneous medium. First, we incorporate the leading term of Hadamard's ansatz into the Kirchhoff-Huygens representation to develop a short-time valid propagator. Second, using the Fourier transform in time, we derive the corresponding Eulerian short-time propagator in frequency domain; on top of this propagator, we further develop a time-frequency-time (TFT) method for the Cauchy problem of time-domain wave equations. Third, we further propose the time-frequency-time-frequency (TFTF) method for the corresponding point-source Helmholtz equation, which provides Green's functions of the Helmholtz equation for all angular frequencies within a given frequency band. Fourth, to implement TFT and TFTF methods efficiently, we introduce butterfly algorithms to compress oscillatory integral kernels at different frequencies. As a result, the proposed methods can construct wave field beyond caustics implicitly and advance spatially overturning waves in time naturally with quasi-optimal computational complexity and memory usage. Furthermore, once constructed the Hadamard integrators can be employed to solve both time-domain wave equations with various initial conditions and frequency-domain wave equations with different point sources. Numerical examples for two-dimensional wave equations illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Purification of Quantum Trajectories under Random Generalized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework to study quantum trajectories resulting from repeated random measurements subject to stationary noise, and generalize results of K\"ummerer and Maassen to this setting. The resulting trajectory of quantum states is a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain in a random environment. K\"ummerer and Maassen introduced the concept of dark subspaces for noise-free processes, establishing that their absence is equivalent to asymptotic purification of the system state. We clarify the notion of dark subspaces in the disordered setting by defining a measurable correspondence consisting of a collection of random subspaces satisfying a darkness condition. We further prove that asymptotic purification occurs if and only if this collection of random dark subspaces is empty. Several examples of these phenomena are provided.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Three-Forms on Symplectic Six-Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometries associated with 3-forms of various orbital types on a symplectic 6-manifold. We show that there are extremely rich geometric structures attached to certain unstable 3-forms arising naturally from degeneration of Calabi-Yau structures, which in turn provides us a new perspective towards the SYZ conjecture. We give concrete examples and demonstrate that the limiting behavior of the Type IIA flow can be used to detect canonical geometric structures on symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Defining subsystems in Hilbert spaces with non-Euclidean metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work outlines a consistent method of identifying subsystems in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, independent of the underlying inner-product structure. It has been well established that Hilbert spaces with modified inner-product, defined through the so-called metric operator, turn out to be the most natural ways to represent certain phenomena such as those involving balanced gain and loss resulting in pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. For composite systems undergoing pseudo-Hermitian evolution, defining the subsystems is generally considered feasible only when the metric operator is chosen to have a tensor product form so that a partial trace operation can be well defined. In this work, we use arguments from algebraic quantum mechanics to show that the subsystems can be well-defined in every metric space -- irrespective of whether or not the metric is of tensor product form. This is done by identifying subsystems with a decomposition of the underlying $C^*$-algebra into commuting sub-algebras. We show that different subsystem decompositions correspond to choosing different equivalence classes of the GNS representation. Furthermore, given a form of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, the choice of the Hamiltonian compatible metric characterizes the subsystem decomposition and as a consequence, the entanglement structure in the system. We clarify how each of the subsystems, defined this way, can be tomographically constructed and that these subsystems satisfy the no-signaling principle. With these results, we put all the choices of the metric operator on an equal footing.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed partition functions with $W$-representations and Nekrasov partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the generalized $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed partition functions through $W$ representations, where the expansions are respectively with respect to the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials labeled by $N$-tuple of Young diagrams. We find that there are the profound interrelations between our deformed partition functions and the $4d$ and $5d$ Nekrasov partition functions. Since the corresponding Nekrasov partition functions can be given by vertex operators, the remarkable connection between our $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed $W$-operators and vertex operators is revealed in this paper. In addition, we investigate the higher Hamiltonians for the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Counter-examples to Gamma conjecture I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Gamma conjecture I and its underlying Conjecture $\mathcal{O}$ for the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles $X_n=\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{P}^{n}}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{O}(n))$ with $n\ge 3$. We show that Conjecture $\mathcal{O}$ does not hold if $n$ is odd, and that Gamma conjecture I does not hold if $n$ is even. Led by this example, we propose modifications for Gamma conjecture I, discuss Gamma conjecture I over the Kahler moduli space, and identify the corresponding principal asymptotic class.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity can be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>
