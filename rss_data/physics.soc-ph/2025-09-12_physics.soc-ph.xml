      <title>Chordless cycle filtrations for dimensionality detection in complex networks via topological data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex networks, ranging from social to biological systems, exhibit structural patterns consistent with an underlying hyperbolic geometry. Revealing the dimensionality of this latent space can disentangle the structural complexity of communities, impact efficient network navigation, and fundamentally shape connectivity and system behavior. We introduce a novel topological data analysis weighting scheme for graphs, based on chordless cycles, aimed at estimating the dimensionality of networks in a data-driven way. We further show that the resulting descriptors can effectively estimate network dimensionality using a neural network architecture trained in a synthetic graph database constructed for this purpose, which does not need retraining to transfer effectively to real-world networks. Thus, by combining cycle-aware filtrations, algebraic topology, and machine learning, our approach provides a robust and effective method for uncovering the hidden geometry of complex networks and guiding accurate modeling and low-dimensional embedding.</description>

      <title>The Computational Foundations of Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why do collectives outperform individuals when solving some problems? Fundamentally, collectives have greater computational resources with more sensory information, more memory, more processing capacity, and more ways to act. While greater resources present opportunities, there are also challenges in coordination and cooperation inherent in collectives with distributed, modular structures. Despite these challenges, we show how collective resource advantages lead directly to well-known forms of collective intelligence including the wisdom of the crowd, collective sensing, division of labour, and cultural learning. Our framework also generates testable predictions about collective capabilities in distributed reasoning and context-dependent behavioural switching. Through case studies of animal navigation and decision-making, we demonstrate how collectives leverage their computational resources to solve problems not only more effectively than individuals, but by using qualitatively different problem-solving strategies.</description>

      <title>Environmental Performance, Financial Constraint and Tax Avoidance Practices: Insights from FTSE All-Share Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through its initiative known as the Climate Change Act (2008), the Government of the United Kingdom encourages corporations to enhance their environmental performance with the significant aim of reducing targeted greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. Previous research has predominantly assessed this encouragement favourably, suggesting that improved environmental performance bolsters governmental efforts to protect the environment and fosters commendable corporate governance practices among companies. Studies indicate that organisations exhibiting strong corporate social responsibility (CSR), environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, or high levels of environmental performance often engage in lower occurrences of tax avoidance. However, our findings suggest that an increase in environmental performance may paradoxically lead to a rise in tax avoidance activities. Using a sample of 567 firms listed on the FTSE All Share from 2014 to 2022, our study finds that firms associated with higher environmental performance are more likely to avoid taxation. The study further documents that the effect is more pronounced for firms facing financial constraints. Entropy balancing, propensity score matching analysis, the instrumental variable method, and the Heckman test are employed in our study to address potential endogeneity concerns. Collectively, the findings of our study suggest that better environmental performance helps explain the variation in firms tax avoidance practices.</description>

      <title>Contagion mean field model for transport in urban traffic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the emergence of macroscopic epidemic type behavior, in the form of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes in urban traffic congestion from microscopic network flows is given. Moreover, it's shown that the emergence of SIS/SIR implies a relationship between traffic flow and density, which is consistent with observations of the so called \emph{Fundamental Diagram of Traffic} (FDT), which is a characteristic signature of vehicle movement phenomena that spans multiple scales. Our results put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Whose Name Comes Up? Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.</description>
