      <title>Directional superradiance in a driven ultracold atomic gas in free-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-cold atomic systems are among the most promising platforms that have the potential to shed light on the complex behavior of many-body quantum systems. One prominent example is the case of a dense ensemble illuminated by a strong coherent drive while interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. Despite being subjected to intense investigations, this system retains many open questions. A recent experiment carried out in a pencil-shaped geometry reported measurements that seemed consistent with the emergence of strong collective effects in the form of a ``superradiant'' phase transition in free space, when looking at the light emission properties in the forward direction. Motivated by the experimental observations, we carry out a systematic theoretical analysis of the system's steady-state properties as a function of the driving strength and atom number, $N$. We observe signatures of collective effects in the weak drive regime, which disappear with increasing drive strength as the system evolves into a single-particle-like mixed state comprised of randomly aligned dipoles. Although the steady-state features some similarities to the reported superradiant to normal non-equilibrium transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence, we observe significant qualitative and quantitative differences, including a different scaling of the critical drive parameter (from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$). We validate the applicability of a mean-field treatment to capture the steady-state dynamics under currently accessible conditions. Furthermore, we develop a simple theoretical model that explains the scaling properties by accounting for interaction-induced inhomogeneous effects and spontaneous emission, which are intrinsic features of interacting disordered arrays in free space.</description>

      <title>Fast real-time arbitrary waveform generation using graphic processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time Arbitrary Waveform Generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications, and often requires complex bespoke hardware and software. This paper introduces an AWG framework using an NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data parallel additive waveform synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG framework is programmed using the developer-friendly Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface from NVIDIA and is readily customizable, and scalable with additional parallel hardware. We present and characterize two different pathways for computing modulated radio-frequency (rf) waveforms: one pathway offers high-complexity simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones for 35 ms at a sampling rate of 560 MB/s, and the other pathway allows simultaneous continuous chirping of 194 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 100 MB/s, or 20 individual tones at 560 MB/s. This AWG framework is designed for fast on-the-fly rearrangement of a large stochastically-loaded optical tweezer array of single atoms or molecules into a defect-free array needed for quantum simulation and quantum computation applications.</description>

      <title>Fractal ground state of ion chains in periodic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity. The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the thermodynamic limit for $\alpha&gt;1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However, due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the interplay between frustration and interactions.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge separation in the quantum boomerang effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the localization dynamics of a SU(2) fermionic wavepacket launched in a (pseudo)random potential. We show that in the limit of strong inter-component repulsions, the total wavepacket exhibits a boomerang-like dynamics, returning near its initial position as expected for non-interacting particles, while separately each spin-component does not. This spin-charge separation effect occurs both in the infinite repulsive limit and at finite interactions. At infinite interactions, the system is integrable and thermalization cannot occur: the two spin-components push each other during the dynamics and their centers of mass stop further from each other than their initial position. At finite interactions, integrability is broken, the two spin-components oscillate and mix, with their center-of-mass positions converging very slowly to the center of mass of the whole system. This is a signature that the final localized state is a fully spin-mixed thermalized state.</description>

      <title>Limits on an improved action for contact effective field theory in two-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a possible resummation of subleading effects in two-body systems with a large scattering length as described by a short-range effective field theory (EFT). In particular, we investigate the consequences of a resummation of part of the range corrections. Explicit calculations of the two-body phase shifts and charge form factor indicate that, except for extreme choices, resummations do not alter the convergence of the EFT expansion and are often beneficial at lowest orders. We have considered the expansion when the regulator cutoff is removed as well as when it is finite, and find that the cutoff is not an important factor for resummations. Our results connect with other works where the partial resummation is induced by potentials with finite cutoffs or interaction ranges.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity of Total Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of a U(1) symmetry leads to superfluidity of a corresponding conserved charge. We generalize the superfluidity to systems with U(1) symmetries acting on both matter fields and two-dimensional spatial coordinates. Such systems can be effectively realized in easy-plane ferromagnetic systems with spin-orbit coupling where the conserved charge is a total angular momentum. We clarify that under a steady injection of spin angular momentum, the superfluid of the total angular momentum shows spacetime oscillations of the spin density and geometry-dependent spin hydrodynamics. We also demonstrate that the steady spin injection destabilizes the superfluid of total angular momentum, causing a dissipation effect in its spin hydrodynamic properties. Our study broadens the comprehension of superfluidity and sheds new light on the interplay between symmetries and phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Pairing from repulsion in a two-dimensional Fermi gas with soft-core interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model many-body system of spinless Fermi gas in two dimensions, where the bare two-body interaction is repulsive and takes the form of a soft-core disk potential. We obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of this model by numerical functional renormalization group (FRG), which retains the effective interaction vertices in all channels to provide a detailed picture of how Cooper pairing emerges under the renormalization flow. The repulsion drives the system to a series of superfluid states with higher angular momentum paring, for example in the $f$- and $h$-wave channels instead of the $p$-wave channel. This is in sharp contrast to the original Kohn-Luttinger mechanism where pairing of very large angular momenta and exponentially small transition temperature was predicted. We trace the stabilization and enhancement of $f$- and $h$-wave pairing back to the momentum dependence of the bare interaction. A perturbative calculation is carried out to show that while the second order Kohn-Luttinger diagrams provide a qualitative understanding of the onsets of the various superfluid phases, they are unable to accurately capture the phase boundaries predicted by FRG. Our findings suggest that tuning the shape of the interaction potential offers a promising route to achieve stronger ``pairing glue" and to realize nontrivial superfluid phases in repulsive Fermi gases beyond the scope of the original Kohn-Luttinger analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a diagrammatic analysis of the energy of a mobile impurity immersed in a strongly interacting two component Fermi gas to second order in the impurity-bath interaction. These corrections demonstrate divergent behavior in the limit of large impurity momentum. We show the fundamental processes responsible for these logarithmically divergent terms.
  We study the problem in the general case without any assumptions regarding the fermion-fermion interactions in the bath. We show that the divergent term can be summed up to all orders in the Fermi-Fermi interaction and that the resulting expression is equivalent to the one obtained in the few body calculation.
  Finally, we provide a perturbative calculation to the second order in the Fermi-Fermi interaction in the annex, and we show the diagrams responsible for these terms.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Dimensional Crossover through Full 3D to 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of dimensional crossover carries profound fundamental significance, serving as a crucial bridge in comprehending the remarkable disparities observed in transitional phenomena across the two distinct dimensions of a physical system. The prevalent strategy for manipulating the dimensionality involves meticulously controlling the external trapping geometry, thereby restricting the degrees of freedom of the kinetic energy from three-dimensional (3D) to lower-dimensional spaces, while maintaining the 3D nature of the interaction energy degrees of freedom. The aim of this work is to introduce an innovative scenario to achieve dimensional crossover, characterized by lower-D nature of both the kinetic and the interaction energy degrees of freedom. To accomplish this objective, we delve deeply into the realm of a 2D optically trapped Bose gas, focusing specifically on its finite-range interaction. Our emphasis lies in exploring the lattice-induced dimensional crossover from full 3D to 1D in both kinetic and interaction terms. Utilizing the functional path integral method, we derive the equation of states of the model system, encompassing crucial quantities such as the ground state energy and quantum depletion. These equations enable us to analyze the combined effects of finite range interaction and an optical lattice on quantum fluctuations of the BEC system. Notably, our analytical findings reconcile the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the ground state energy in 3D and Lieb-Liniger (LL) ones in 1D limit, thereby providing fresh insights into the intriguing disparities between LHY and LL corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice polarons, quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an impurity and its surrounding bosonic environment confined to a lattice system, have emerged as a platform for generating complex few-body states, probing many-body phenomena, and addressing long-standing problems in physics. In this study, we employ a variational ansatz to investigate the quasiparticle and spectral properties of an impurity coupled to a condensate gas of hard-core bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice. Our findings demonstrate that the polaron features can be tuned by adjusting the filling factor of the bath, revealing intriguing polaron characteristics in the strongly interacting regime. These results offer valuable insights for lattice polaron experiments with ultracold gases and can serve as a guide for new experiments in emergent quantum devices, such as moir\'e materials, where optical excitations can be described in terms of hard-core bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spontaneous symmetry-breaking order is conventionally described by a tensor-product wave-function of some few-body clusters. We discuss a type of symmetry-breaking orders, dubbed entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders, which cannot be realized by any tensor-product state. Given a symmetry breaking pattern, we propose a criterion to diagnose if the symmetry-breaking order is entanglement-enabled, by examining the compatibility between the symmetries and the tensor-product description. For concreteness, we present an infinite family of exactly solvable gapped models on one-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor interactions, whose ground states exhibit entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders from a discrete symmetry breaking. In addition, these ground states have gapless edge modes protected by the unbroken symmetries. We also propose a construction to realize entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Under the unbroken symmetries, some of our examples can be viewed as symmetry-protected topological states that are beyond the conventional classifications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality in Open Quantum Spin Chains with Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of nonreciprocity on universality and critical phenomena in open quantum interacting many-body systems. Nonreciprocal open quantum systems often have an exotic spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE). By considering an open quantum XXZ spin chain that exhibits LSE, we demonstrate the existence of a universal scaling regime that is not affected by the presence of the LSE. We resolve the critical exponents, which differ from those of free fermions, via tensor network methods and demonstrate that observables exhibit a universal scaling collapse, irrespective of the reciprocity. We find that the LSE only becomes relevant when a healing length scale $\xi_{\rm heal}$ at the system's edge (which is different to the localization length of the eigenstate of the Liouvillian) exceeds the system size, allowing edge properties to dominate the physics. We expect this result to be a generic feature of nonreciprocal models in the vicinity of a critical point. The driven-dissipative quantum criticality we observe has no classical analogue and stems from the existence of multiple dark states.</description>

      <title>Pairing dome from an emergent Feshbach resonance in a strongly repulsive bilayer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key to understanding unconventional superconductivity lies in unraveling the pairing mechanism of mobile charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets, yielding an effective attraction between charges even in the presence of strong repulsive Coulomb interactions. Here, we study pairing in a mixed-dimensional (mixD) $t-J$ model, featuring robust binding energies -- despite dominant repulsive interactions -- that are strongly enhanced in the finite doping regime. The single and coupled mixD ladders we study, corresponding to bilayers of width $w\leq 2$, feature a crossover from tightly bound pairs of holes (closed channel) at small repulsion, to more spatially extended, correlated pairs of individual holes (open channel) at large repulsion. We derive an effective model for the latter, in which the attraction is mediated by the closed channel, in analogy to atomic Feshbach resonances. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations we reveal a dome of large binding energies at around $30\%$ doping, accompanied by a change of the Fermi surface volume and a crossover from extended to tightly bound hole pairs. Our work provides a microscopic theory of pairing in the doped mixD system with dominant repulsion, closely related to bilayer, Ni-based superconductors, and our predictions can be tested in state-of-the-art quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism and anomalous transport in 1D semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the time-dependent free energy functionals of the semiclassical one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. We first review the weakly chaotic dynamics and the consequent early-time anomalous diffusion in the system. The anomalous diffusion is robust, appears with strictly quantized coefficients, and persists even for very long chains (more than hundred sites), crossing over to normal diffusion at late times. We identify fast (angle) and slow (action) variables and thus consider annealed and quenched partition functions, corresponding to fixing the actions and integrating over the actions, respectively. We observe the leading quantum effects in the annealed free energy, whereas the quenched energy is undefined in the thermodynamic limit, signaling the absence of thermodynamic equilibrium in the quenched regime. But already the leading correction away from the quenched regime reproduces the annealed partition function exactly. This encapsulates the fact that in both slow- and fast-chaos regime both the anomalous and the normal diffusion can be seen (though at different times).</description>

Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</description>
