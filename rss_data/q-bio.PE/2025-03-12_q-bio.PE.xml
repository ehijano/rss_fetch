      <title>Redefining Fitness: Evolution as a Dynamic Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution is the process of optimal adaptation of biological populations to their living environments. This is expressed via the concept of fitness, defined as relative reproductive success. However, it has been pointed out that this definition is incomplete and logically circular. To address this issue, several authors have called for new ways to specify fitness explicitly in terms of the relationship between phenotypes and their environment. Here, we show that fitness, defined as the likelihood function that follows from mapping population dynamics to Bayesian learning, provides a general solution to this problem. We show how probabilistic models of fitness can easily be constructed in this way, and how their averages acquire meaning as information. We also show how this approach leads to powerful tools to analyze challenging problems of evolution in variable environments, game theory, and selection in group-structured populations. The approach is general and creates an explicit bridge between population dynamics under selection, statistical learning theory, and emerging models of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Study on Dynamical Behavior of Coinfection Infectious Disease Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conducts research on the established model and presents the main conclusions . Firstly, by separately considering the infectivity of each of the two infectious diseases and the infectivity of the population simultaneously infected with the two infectious diseases, the existence of three types of boundary equilibrium points is determined, as well as the existence of the interior equilibrium point when the parameters are under specific conditions. Then, the stability of the equilibrium points is analyzed. It is concluded that under different parameter conditions, the stability of the disease free equilibrium point can exhibit various scenarios, such as a stable node or a saddle-node, etc. For the boundary equilibrium points, the situation is more intricate,and a cusp may occur. The stability of the interior equilibrium point under specific conditions is also presented. Finally,the degeneracy of the equilibrium points is studied through the bifurcation theory.Mainly, the saddle-node bifurcation occurring at the interior equilibrium point is obtained, and when the infection rate of the first infectious disease, the infection rate of the second infectious disease, and the infection rate of the co-infected population to other populations are selected as bifurcation parameters, a codimension 3 B-T bifurcation is obtained.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>

      <title>Bounding the SNPR distance between two tree-child networks using generalised agreement forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agreement forests continue to play a central role in the comparison of phylogenetic trees since their introduction more than 25 years ago. More specifically, they are used to characterise several distances that are based on tree rearrangement operations and related quantifiers of dissimilarity between phylogenetic trees. In addition, the concept of agreement forests continues to underlie most advancements in the development of algorithms that exactly compute the aforementioned measures. In this paper, we introduce agreement digraphs, a concept that generalises agreement forests for two phylogenetic trees to two phylogenetic networks. Analogous to the way in which agreement forests compute the subtree prune and regraft distance between two phylogenetic trees but inherently more complex, we then use agreement digraphs to bound the subnet prune and regraft distance between two tree-child networks from above and below and show that our bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>Demographic effects of aggregation in the presence of a component Allee effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The component Allee effect (AE) is the positive correlation between an organism's fitness component and population density. Depending on the population spatial structure, which determines the interactions between organisms, a component AE might lead to positive density-dependence in the population per capita growth rate and establish a demographic AE. However, existing spatial models impose a fixed population spatial structure, which limits the understanding of how a component AE and spatial dynamics jointly determine the existence of demographic AEs. We introduce a spatially explicit theoretical framework where spatial structure and population dynamics are emergent properties of the individual-level demographic and movement rates. This framework predicts various spatial patterns depending on its specific parameterization, including evenly spaced aggregates of organisms, that determine the demographic-level by-products of the component AE. We find that aggregation increases population abundance and allows population survival in harsher environments and at lower global population densities when compared with uniformly distributed organisms. Moreover, aggregation can prevent the component AE from manifesting at the population level or restrict it to the level of each independent aggregate. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how component AEs might operate for different spatial structures and manifest at larger scales.</description>
