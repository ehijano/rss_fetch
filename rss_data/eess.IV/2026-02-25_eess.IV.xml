      <title>AINet: Anchor Instances Learning for Regional Heterogeneity in Whole Slide Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-instance learning (MIL) have witnessed impressive performance in whole slide image (WSI) analysis. However, the inherent sparsity of tumors and their morphological diversity lead to obvious heterogeneity across regions, posing significant challenges in aggregating high-quality and discriminative representations. To address this, we introduce a novel concept of anchor instance (AI), a compact subset of instances that are representative within their regions (local) and discriminative at the bag (global) level. These AIs act as semantic references to guide interactions across regions, correcting non-discriminative patterns while preserving regional diversity. Specifically, we propose a dual-level anchor mining (DAM) module to \textbf{select} AIs from massive instances, where the most informative AI in each region is extracted by assessing its similarity to both local and global embeddings. Furthermore, to ensure completeness and diversity, we devise an anchor-guided region correction (ARC) module that explores the complementary information from all regions to \textbf{correct} each regional representation. Building upon DAM and ARC, we develop a concise yet effective framework, AINet, which employs a simple predictor and surpasses state-of-the-art methods with substantially fewer FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, both DAM and ARC are modular and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MIL frameworks, consistently improving their performance.</description>

      <title>Targeted T2-FLAIR Dropout Training Improves Robustness of nnU-Net Glioblastoma Segmentation to Missing T2-FLAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To determine whether targeted T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) dropout training improves glioblastoma MRI tumor segmentation robustness to missing T2-FLAIR without degrading performance when T2-FLAIR is available. Materials and Methods: This retrospective multi-dataset study developed nnU-Net models on BraTS 2021 (n=848) and externally tested them on UPenn-GBM glioblastoma MRI (n=403; 2006-2018; age 18-89 years; 60% male). Models were trained with no dropout or targeted T2-FLAIR dropout (probability rate r=0.35 or 0.50) by replacing only the T2-FLAIR channel with zeros. Inference used T2-FLAIR-present and T2-FLAIR-absent scenarios (T2-FLAIR set to zero). The primary endpoint was Dice similarity coefficient (DSC); secondary endpoints were 95th percentile Hausdorff distance and Bland-Altman whole-tumor volume bias. Equivalence was assessed with two one-sided tests using +/-1.5 DSC percentage points, and noninferiority versus HD-GLIO used a -1.5-point margin. Results: With T2-FLAIR present, median overall DSC was 94.8% (interquartile range, 90.0%-97.1%) with dropout and 95.0% (interquartile range, 90.3%-97.1%) without dropout (equivalence supported, p&lt;0.001). With T2-FLAIR absent, median overall DSC improved from 81.0% (interquartile range, 75.1%-86.4%) without dropout to 93.4% (interquartile range, 89.1%-96.2%) with dropout (r=0.35); edema DSC improved from 14.0% to 87.0%, edema 95th percentile Hausdorff distance improved from 22.44 mm to 2.45 mm, and whole-tumor volume bias improved from -45.6 mL to 0.83 mL. Dropout was noninferior to HD-GLIO under T2-FLAIR-present (all p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Targeted T2-FLAIR dropout preserved segmentation performance when T2-FLAIR was available and reduced segmentation error and whole-tumor volume bias when T2-FLAIR was absent.</description>

      <title>Progressive Per-Branch Depth Optimization for DEFOM-Stereo and SAM3 Joint Analysis in UAV Forestry Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate per-branch 3D reconstruction is a prerequisite for autonomous UAV-based tree pruning; however, dense disparity maps from modern stereo matchers often remain too noisy for individual branch analysis in complex forest canopies. This paper introduces a progressive pipeline integrating DEFOM-Stereo foundation-model disparity estimation, SAM3 instance segmentation, and multi-stage depth optimization to deliver robust per-branch point clouds. Starting from a naive baseline, we systematically identify and resolve three error families through successive refinements. Mask boundary contamination is first addressed through morphological erosion and subsequently refined via a skeleton-preserving variant to safeguard thin-branch topology. Segmentation inaccuracy is then mitigated using LAB-space Mahalanobis color validation coupled with cross-branch overlap arbitration. Finally, depth noise - the most persistent error source - is initially reduced by outlier removal and median filtering, before being superseded by a robust five-stage scheme comprising MAD global detection, spatial density consensus, local MAD filtering, RGB-guided filtering, and adaptive bilateral filtering. Evaluated on 1920x1080 stereo imagery of Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) acquired with a ZED Mini camera (63 mm baseline) from a UAV in Canterbury, New Zealand, the proposed pipeline reduces the average per-branch depth standard deviation by 82% while retaining edge fidelity. The result is geometrically coherent 3D point clouds suitable for autonomous pruning tool positioning. All code and processed data are publicly released to facilitate further UAV forestry research.</description>

      <title>Multimodal MRI Report Findings Supervised Brain Lesion Segmentation with Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Report-supervised (RSuper) learning seeks to alleviate the need for dense tumor voxel labels with constraints derived from radiology reports (e.g., volumes, counts, sizes, locations). In MRI studies of brain tumors, however, we often involve multi-parametric scans and substructures. Here, fine-grained modality/parameter-wise reports are usually provided along with global findings and are correlated with different substructures. Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences. Certainty tokens scale penalties; missing cues are down-weighted. On 1238 report-labeled BraTS-MET/MEN scans, our MS-RSuper largely outperforms both a sparsely-supervised baseline and a naive RSuper method.</description>

      <title>Vision-Inspired Image Quality Assessment for Radar-Based Human Activity Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition has gained attention as a privacy-preserving alternative to vision and wearable sensors, especially in sensitive environments like long-term care facilities. Micro-Doppler spectrograms derived from FMCW radar signals are central to recognizing dynamic activities, but their effectiveness is limited by noise and clutter. In this work, we use a benchmark radar dataset to reimplement and assess three recent denoising and preprocessing techniques: adaptive preprocessing, adaptive thresholding, and entropy-based denoising. To illustrate the shortcomings of conventional metrics in low-SNR regimes, we evaluate performance using both perceptual image quality measures and standard error-based metrics. We additionally propose a novel framework for static activity recognition using range-angle feature maps to expand HAR beyond dynamic activities. We present two important contributions: a temporal tracking algorithm to enforce consistency and a no-reference quality scoring algorithm to assess RA-map fidelity. According to experimental findings, our suggested techniques enhance classification performance and interpretability for both dynamic and static activities, opening the door for more reliable radar-based HAR systems.</description>

      <title>A Light Fixture Color Temperature and Color Rendering Index Measuring Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI) of artificial light sources are important because they have implications for human biology and professional applications. Although CCT information is generally available for commercial lamps, CRI is commonly not reported. In addition, devices measuring these parameters are difficult to access as they require a spectrophotometer, a commonly expensive device. In this context, the present work designs and builds a meter in detail, from the structural part of the equipment, interface with sensors, and the calculation to the compensation algorithms implementation, aiming to build the dedicated functionalities of a spectrophotometer, which is designed without the use of optical lenses. In addition to simplifying the device, this approach allows measurements free from dispersions caused by chromatic aberrations typical of optical lenses. The prototype obtained proved to be effective, capturing the spectral power distributions of various light sources and calculating their CCT and CRI.</description>

      <title>GSNR: Graph Smooth Null-Space Representation for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems in imaging are ill-posed, leading to infinitely many solutions consistent with the measurements due to the non-trivial null-space of the sensing matrix. Common image priors promote solutions on the general image manifold, such as sparsity, smoothness, or score function. However, as these priors do not constrain the null-space component, they can bias the reconstruction. Thus, we aim to incorporate meaningful null-space information in the reconstruction framework. Inspired by smooth image representation on graphs, we propose Graph-Smooth Null-Space Representation (GSNR), a mechanism that imposes structure only into the invisible component. Particularly, given a graph Laplacian, we construct a null-restricted Laplacian that encodes similarity between neighboring pixels in the null-space signal, and we design a low-dimensional projection matrix from the $p$-smoothest spectral graph modes (lowest graph frequencies). This approach has strong theoretical and practical implications: i) improved convergence via a null-only graph regularizer, ii) better coverage, how much null-space variance is captured by $p$ modes, and iii) high predictability, how well these modes can be inferred from the measurements. GSNR is incorporated into well-known inverse problem solvers, e.g., PnP, DIP, and diffusion solvers, in four scenarios: image deblurring, compressed sensing, demosaicing, and image super-resolution, providing consistent improvement of up to 4.3 dB over baseline formulations and up to 1 dB compared with end-to-end learned models in terms of PSNR.</description>

      <title>Comparing Implicit Neural Representations and B-Splines for Continuous Function Fitting from Sparse Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20535v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous signal representations are naturally suited for inverse problems, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography, because the measurements depend on an underlying physically continuous signal. While classical methods rely on predefined analytical bases like B-splines, implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative that use coordinate-based networks to parameterize continuous functions with implicitly defined bases. Despite their empirical success, direct comparisons of their intrinsic representation capabilities with conventional models remain limited. This preliminary empirical study compares a positional-encoded INR with a cubic B-spline model for continuous function fitting from sparse random samples, isolating the representation capacity difference by only using coefficient-domain Tikhonov regularization. Results demonstrate that, under oracle hyperparameter selection, the INR achieves a lower normalized root-mean-squared error, yielding sharper edge transitions and fewer oscillatory artifacts than the oracle-tuned B-spline model. Additionally, we show that a practical bilevel optimization framework for INR hyperparameter selection based on measurement data split effectively approximates oracle performance. These findings empirically support the superior representation capacity of INRs for sparse data fitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning for radiologic image analysis is a rapidly growing field in biomedical research and is likely to become a standard practice in modern medicine. On the publicly available NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, containing X-ray images that are classified by the presence or absence of 14 different diseases, we reproduced an algorithm known as CheXNet, as well as explored other algorithms that outperform CheXNet's baseline metrics. Model performance was primarily evaluated using the F1 score and AUC-ROC, both of which are critical metrics for imbalanced, multi-label classification tasks in medical imaging. The best model achieved an average AUC-ROC score of 0.85 and an average F1 score of 0.39 across all 14 disease classifications present in the dataset.</description>

      <title>Chlorophyll-a Mapping and Prediction in the Mar Menor Lagoon Using C2RCC-Processed Sentinel 2 Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mar Menor, Europe's largest hypersaline coastal lagoon, located in southeastern Spain, has undergone severe eutrophication crises, with devastating impacts on biodiversity and water quality. Monitoring chlorophyll-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, is essential to anticipate harmful algal blooms and guide mitigation strategies. Traditional in situ measurements, while precise, are spatially and temporally limited. Satellite-based approaches provide a more comprehensive view, enabling scalable and long-term monitoring. This study aims to overcome limitations of chlorophyll monitoring, often restricted to surface estimates or limited temporal coverage, by developing a reliable methodology to predict and map chlorophyll-a concentrations across the water column of the Mar Menor. This work integrates Sentinel 2 imagery with buoy-based ground truth to create models capable of high-resolution, depth-specific monitoring, enhancing early-warning capabilities for eutrophication. Sentinel 2 images were atmospherically corrected using C2RCC processors. Buoy data were aggregated by depth. Multiple ML algorithms, including CatBoost, XGBoost, SVMs, and MLPs, were trained and validated using a cross-validation scheme with multi-objective optimization functions. Band-combination experiments and spatial aggregation strategies were tested to optimize prediction. The results show depth-dependent performance. The Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) obtained ranges from 0.34 at the surface to 0.39 at 3-4 m, while the R2 value was 0.76 at the surface, 0.76 at 1-2 m, 0.70 at 2-3 m, and 0.60 at 3-4 m. Generated maps successfully reproduced known eutrophication events. The study delivers an end-to-end, validated methodology chlorophyll mapping. Its integration of multispectral band combinations, buoy calibration, and modeling offers a transferable framework for other turbid coastal systems.</description>

      <title>SAS-Net: Scene-Appearance Separation Network for Robust Spatiotemporal Registration in Bidirectional Photoacoustic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional scanning enables rapid functional brain imaging but introduces severe spatiotemporal
  misalignment from coupled scan-direction-dependent domain shift and geometric distortion. Conventional registration methods rely on brightness constancy, an assumption
  violated under bidirectional scanning, leading to unreliable alignment. A unified scene-appearance separation framework is proposed to jointly address domain shift and
  spatial misalignment. The proposed architecture separates domain-invariant scene content from domain-specific appearance characteristics, enabling cross-domain
  reconstruction with geometric preservation. A scene consistency loss promotes geometric correspondence in the latent space, linking domain shift correction with spatial
  registration within a single framework. For in vivo mouse brain vasculature imaging, the proposed method achieves normalized cross-correlation (NCC) of 0.961 and
  structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.894, substantially outperforming conventional methods. Ablation studies demonstrate that domain alignment loss is critical,
  with its removal causing 82% NCC reduction (0.961 to 0.175), while scene consistency and cycle consistency losses provide complementary regularization for optimal
  performance. The method achieves 11.2 ms inference time per frame (86 fps), substantially exceeding typical OR-PAM acquisition rates and enabling real-time processing.
  These results suggest that the proposed framework enables robust high-speed bidirectional OR-PAM for reliable quantitative and longitudinal functional imaging. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAS-Net</description>

      <title>Learning Hierarchical Sparse Transform Coding for 3DGS Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22908v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current 3DGS compression methods largely forego the neural analysis-synthesis transform, which is a crucial component in learned signal compression systems. As a result, redundancy removal is left solely to the entropy coder, overburdening the entropy coding module and reducing rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To fix this critical omission, we propose a training-time transform coding (TTC) method that adds the analysis-synthesis transform and optimizes it jointly with the 3DGS representation and entropy model. Concretely, we adopt a hierarchical design: a channel-wise KLT for decorrelation and energy compaction, followed by a sparsity-aware neural transform that reconstructs the KLT residuals with minimal parameter and computational overhead. Experiments show that our method delivers strong R-D performance with fast decoding, offering a favorable BD-rate-decoding-time trade-off over SOTA 3DGS compressors.</description>

      <title>NRSeg: Noise-Resilient Learning for BEV Semantic Segmentation via Driving World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model, where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV segmentation tasks, respectively.

      <title>Sound Source Localization for Spatial Mapping of Surgical Actions in Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24332</link>

Abstract: Purpose: Surgical scene understanding is key to advancing computer-aided and intelligent surgical systems. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual data or end-to-end learning, which limits fine-grained contextual modeling. This work aims to enhance surgical scene representations by integrating 3D acoustic information, enabling temporally and spatially aware multimodal understanding of surgical environments.
  Methods: We propose a novel framework for generating 4D audio-visual representations of surgical scenes by projecting acoustic localization information from a phased microphone array onto dynamic point clouds from an RGB-D camera. A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies relevant temporal segments containing tool-tissue interactions which are spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation. The system was experimentally evaluated in a realistic operating room setup during simulated surgical procedures performed by experts.
  Results: The proposed method successfully localizes surgical acoustic events in 3D space and associates them with visual scene elements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates accurate spatial sound localization and robust fusion of multimodal data, providing a comprehensive, dynamic representation of surgical activity.
  Conclusion: This work introduces the first approach for spatial sound localization in dynamic surgical scenes, marking a significant advancement toward multimodal surgical scene representations. By integrating acoustic and visual data, the proposed framework enables richer contextual understanding and provides a foundation for future intelligent and autonomous surgical systems.</description>

      <title>GOT-Edit: Geometry-Aware Generic Object Tracking via Online Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human perception for effective object tracking in 2D video streams arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge and semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings, while neglecting 3D geometric cues, making them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to infer geometric cues from only a few 2D images. To address the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing. By leveraging null-space constraints during model updates, it incorporates geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.
