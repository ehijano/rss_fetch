      <title>Recent and Upcoming Upgrades for MIRC-X and MYSTIC on the CHARA Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIRC-X and MYSTIC are six-telescope near-infrared beam (1.08-2.38 ${\mu}$m) combiners at the CHARA Array on Mt Wilson CA, USA. Ever since the commissioning of MIRC-X (J and H bands) in 2018 and MYSTIC (K bands) in 2021, they have been the most popular and over-subscribed instruments at the array. Observers have been able to image stellar objects with sensitivity down to 8.1 mag in H and 7.8 mag in K-band under the very best conditions. In 2022 MYSTIC was upgraded with a new ABCD mode using the VLTI/GRAVITY 4-beam integrated optics chip, with the goal of improving the sensitivity and calibration. The ABCD mode has been used to observe more than 20 T Tauri stars; however, the data pipeline is still being developed. Alongside software upgrades, we detail planned upgrades to both instruments in this paper. The main upgrades are: 1) Adding a motorized filter wheel to MIRC-X along with new high spectral resolution modes 2) Updating MIRC-X optics to allow for simultaneous 6T J+H observations 3) Removing the warm window between the spectrograph and the warm optics in MYSTIC 4) Adding a 6T ABCD mode to MIRC-X in collaboration with CHARA/SPICA 5) Updating the MIRC-X CRED-ONE camera funded by Prof. Kraus from U. Exeter 6) Carrying out science verification of the MIRC-X polarization mode 7) Developing new software for ABCD-mode data reduction and more efficient calibration routines. We expect these upgrades to not only improve the observing experience, but also increase the sensitivity by 0.4 mag in J+H-bands, and 1 mag in K-band.</description>

      <title>Bright Star Subtraction Pipeline for LSST: Phase one report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the phase one report of the Bright Star Subtraction (BSS) pipeline for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This pipeline is designed to create an extended PSF model by utilizing observed stars, followed by subtracting this model from the bright stars present in LSST data. Running the pipeline on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data shows a correlation between the shape of the extended PSF model and the position of the detector within the camera's focal plane. Specifically, detectors positioned closer to the focal plane's edge exhibit reduced circular symmetry in the extended PSF model. To mitigate this effect, we present an algorithm that enables users to account for the location dependency of the model. Our analysis also indicates that the choice of normalization annulus is crucial for modeling the extended PSF. Smaller annuli can exclude stars due to overlap with saturated regions, while larger annuli may compromise data quality because of lower signal-to-noise ratios. This makes finding the optimal annulus size a challenging but essential task for the BSS pipeline. Applying the BSS pipeline to HSC exposures allows for the subtraction of, on average, 100 to 700 stars brighter than 12th magnitude measured in g-band across a full exposure, with a full HSC exposure comprising ~100 detectors.</description>

      <title>Development of the cadmium zinc TElluride Radiation Imager (TERI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cadmium zinc TElluride Radiation Imager, or TERI, is an instrument to space qualify large-volume $4 \times 4 \times 1.5 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ pixelated CdZnTe (CZT) detector technology. The CZT's anode is composed of a $22 \times 22$ array of pixels while the cathode is planar. TERI will contain four of those crystals with each pixel having an energy range of $40 \ \mathrm{keV}$ up to $3 \ \mathrm{MeV}$ with a resolution of $1.3 \%$ full-width-at-half maximum at $662 \ \mathrm{keV}$. As the detectors are 3D position sensitive, TERI can Compton image events. TERI is fitted with a coded-aperture mask which permits imaging low energy photons in the photoelectric regime. TERI's primary mission is to space-qualify large-volume CZT and measure its degradation due to radiation damage in a space environment. Its secondary mission includes detecting and localizing astrophysical gamma-ray transients. TERI is manifested on DoD's STP-H10 mission for launch to the International Space Station in early 2025.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Fireball Luminous Efficiency Models using Acoustic Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The total energy of a fireball is commonly obtained from optical measurements with an assumed value for luminous efficiency. Acoustic energy measurements offer an independent means of energy estimation. Here we combine optical and acoustic methods to validate the luminous efficiency model of Borovi\v{c}ka et al. (2020). Our goal is to compare these models with acoustic measurements of meteoroid energy deposition. Employing theoretical blast scaling laws following the approach of McFadden et al. (2021), we determine explosive yields for both fireball fragmentation events and cylindrical shocks for four different bright fireballs. We model fireballs using the MetSim software (Vida et al., 2023) and find that the Borovi\v{c}ka et al. (2020) model produces agreement better than a factor of two for our three chondritic fireball case studies. The major exception is an iron meteorite-producing fireball where the luminous efficiency is an order of magnitude higher than model predictions calibrated with stony fireballs. We suggest that large disparities between optical and acoustic energies could be a signature of iron fireballs and hence useful as a discriminant of that population.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Period Solutions from Combined Dense and Sparse Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deriving high quality lightcuves for asteroids and other periodic sources from survey data is challenging due to many factors, including the sparsely sampled observational record and diurnal aliasing which is a signature imparted into the periodic signal of a source that is a function of the observing schedule of ground-based telescopes. In this paper, we examine the utility of combining asteroid observational records from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) which are the ground- and space-based facilities, respectively, to determine to what degree the data from the space-based facility can suppress diurnal aliases. Furthermore, we examine several optimizations that are used to derive the rotation periods of asteroids which we then compare to the reported rotation periods in the literature. Through this analysis we find that we can reliably derive the rotation periods for ~85% of our sample of 222 objects that are also reported in the literature and that the remaining ~15% are difficult to reliably derive as many are asteroids that are insufficiently elongated which produces a lightcurve with an insufficient amplitude and consequently, an incorrect rotation period. We also investigate a binary classification method that biases against reporting incorrect rotation periods. We conclude the paper by assessing the utility of using other ground- or space-based facilities as companion telescopes to the forthcoming Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Assessing the residual biases in high-resolution transit absorption spectra correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years it has become common practice to divide observed transit absorption spectra by synthetic absorption spectra computed for the transit of an atmosphere-less planet. This action supposedly corrects the observed absorption spectrum, leaving the sole atmospheric absorption signature free from the biases induced by stellar rotation and centre-to-limb variations. We aim to show that while this practice is beneficial, it does not completely correct the absorption spectrum from the stellar distortions and that some residual biases remain, leaving a possibly altered atmospheric signature. By reducing the problem to its most basic form, we show that dividing the observed absorption spectrum by a synthetic absorption spectrum of the planet does not isolate the pure atmospheric absorption signature. We also used simulated synthetic transit observations to assess the magnitude of these residual biases in typical transit observations. We show that dividing the observed absorption spectrum by the planetary absorption spectrum results in an atmospheric signature modulated by the ratio of the flux behind the atmosphere and the flux behind the planet. Depending on the non-homogeneity of the stellar spectrum, this leads to distorted atmospheric signatures. Eventually, directly analysing these biased signatures will lead to wrong estimates of planetary atmosphere properties.</description>

      <title>The challenge of detecting remote spectroscopic signatures from radionuclides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through transit spectra is becoming increasingly feasible, and technology for direct detection remains ongoing. The possibility of detecting spectral features could enable quantitative constraints on atmospheric composition or even serve as a potential biosignature, with the sensitivity of the instrument and observation time as key limiting factors. This paper discusses the possibility that future remote observations could detect the presence of radioactive elements in the atmospheres of exoplanets. Such radionuclides could arise from cosmogenic or geologic sources, as well as from industrial sources, all of which occur on Earth. The detection of radionuclides in an exoplanetary atmosphere could reveal important properties about the planet's geology or space environment, and potentially could serve as a technosignature. However, many radionuclides, including those from industrial sources, attach to aerosol or other particles that cannot be remotely characterized. Limited experimental and theoretical spectral data exist for long-lived radionuclides, but the sensitivity required to detect the spectral features of some known radionuclides would be at least several orders of magnitude greater than required to detect the spectral features of molecular oxygen. Present-day remote spectroscopic observing mission concepts at ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths are not sensitive to discern the presence of radionuclides in exoplanetary atmospheres. Interplanetary fly-by or probe missions may be more likely to provide such data in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves modulate the apparent frequencies of other periodic signals. Low-frequency gravitational waves could therefore be detected by observing frequency modulations in signals from higher-frequency sources, e.g., those from binary white dwarfs detected with the LISA gravitational-wave detector. We propose a concrete method to extract these modulations by coherently adding the cross-spectra of a large number of well-resolved quasi-monochromatic signals. We apply this method to the case of LISA, and find this method would enable the detection of background gravitational wave strain amplitudes of, e.g., $A\simeq10^{-10}$ at a frequency $F\simeq10^{-8}\,\rm Hz$, given current projections for the number and properties of Galactic binary white dwarfs and the sensitivity of the instrument. We also estimate (to within an order of magnitude) that this method could potentially compete with that of current Pulsar Timing Arrays when using signals from binary neutron stars such as those expected to be observed with proposed detectors like DECIGO. Our results show that gravitational-wave detectors could be sensitive at frequencies outside of their designed bandwidth using the same infrastructure, which has the potential to open up unexplored and otherwise inaccessible parts of the gravitational wave spectrum.</description>

      <title>Imprints of massive black-hole binaries on neighbouring decihertz gravitational-wave sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most massive black holes in our Universe form binaries at the centre of merging galaxies. The recent evidence for a gravitational-wave (GW) background from pulsar timing may constitute the first observation that these supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) merge. Yet, the most massive SMBHBs are out of reach of interferometric {GW} detectors and are exceedingly difficult to resolve individually with pulsar timing. These limitations call for unexplored strategies to detect individual SMBHBs in the uncharted frequency band $\lesssim10^{-5}\,\rm Hz$ in order to establish their abundance and decipher the coevolution with their host galaxies. Here we show that SMBHBs imprint detectable long-term modulations on GWs from stellar-mass binaries residing in the same galaxy. We determine that proposed deci-Hz GW interferometers sensitive to numerous stellar-mass binaries could uncover modulations from $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^{-1}$ - $10^4)$ SMBHBs with masses $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^7$ - $10^8)\,\rm M_\odot$ out to redshift $z\sim3.5$. This offers a unique opportunity to map the population of SMBHBs through cosmic time, which might remain inaccessible otherwise.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of multimessenger astrophysical data: Joint and coherent inference of gravitational waves and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian framework for joint and coherent analyses of multimessenger binary neutron star signals. The method, implemented in our bajes infrastructure, incorporates a joint likelihood for multiple datasets, support for various semi-analytical kilonova models and numerical-relativity (NR) informed relations for the mass ejecta, as well as a technique to include and marginalize over modeling uncertainties. As a first application, we analyze the gravitational-wave GW170817 and the kilonova AT2017gfo data. These results are then combined with the most recent X-ray pulsars analyses of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 to obtain EOS constraints.Various constraints on the mass-radius diagram and neutron star properties are then obtained by resampling over a set of ten million parametrized EOS built under minimal assumptions. We find that a joint and coherent approach improves the inference of the extrinsic parameters (distance) and, among the instrinc parameters, the mass ratio. The inclusion of NR informed relations strongly improves over the case of using an agnostic prior on the intrinsic parameters. Comparing Bayes factors, we find that the two observations are better explained by the common source hypothesis only by assuming NR-informed relations. These relations break some of the degeneracies in the employed kN models. The EOS inference folding-in PSR J0952-0607 minimum-maximum mass, PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 data constrains, among other quantities, the neutron star radius to $R_{1.4}={12.30}^{+0.81}_{-0.56}$ km ($R_{1.4}={13.20}^{+0.91}_{-0.90}$ km) and the maximum mass to $M_{max}={2.28}^{+0.25}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_\odot}$ ($M_{max}={2.32}^{+0.30}_{-0.19}~{\rm M_\odot}$) where the ST+PDT (PDT-U) analysis of Vinciguerra et a (2023) for PSR J0030+0451 is employed. Hence, the systematics on PSR J0030+0451 data reduction currently dominate the mass-radius diagram constraints.</description>

      <title>Equations of State, Thermodynamics, and Miscibility Curves for Jovian Planet and Giant Exoplanet Evolutionary Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of hydrogen-helium (H-He) mixtures plays a vital role in the evolution and structure of gas giant planets and exoplanets. Recent equations of state that account for hydrogen-helium interactions, coupled with hydrogen-helium immiscibility curves, can now produce more physical evolutionary models, such as accounting for helium rain with greater fidelity than in the past. In this work, we present a set of tools for planetary evolution\footnote{All tables of thermodynamic quantities and derivatives are available at \url{https://github.com/Rob685/hhe_eos_misc}, along with a unified Python interface. Tutorials demonstrating the interface are also available in the repository.} that provides a Python interface for existing tables of useful thermodynamic quantities, state-of-the-art H-He equations of state, and pressure-dependent H-He immiscibility curves. In particular, for a collection of independent variable choices, we provide scripts to calculate the variety of thermodynamic derivatives used to model convection and energy transport. These include the chemical potential derived from the internal energy, which is a modeling necessity in the presence of composition gradients when entropy is the other primary variable. Finally, an entropy-based convection formalism is presented and fully described that highlights the physical differences between adiabatic and isentropic interior models. This centralized resource is meant to facilitate both giant planet structural and evolutionary modeling and the entry of new research groups into the field of giant planet modeling.</description>

      <title>Simulation of radio signals from cosmic-ray cascades in air and ice as observed by in-ice Askaryan radio detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15358v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino observatories will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.</description>
