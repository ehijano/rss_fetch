      <title>Cascaded Learned Bloom Filter for Optimal Model-Filter Size Balance and Fast Rejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that learned Bloom filters, which combine machine learning with the classical Bloom filter, can achieve superior memory efficiency. However, existing learned Bloom filters face two critical unresolved challenges: the balance between the machine learning model size and the Bloom filter size is not optimal, and the reject time cannot be minimized effectively. We propose the Cascaded Learned Bloom Filter (CLBF) to address these issues. Our dynamic programming-based optimization automatically selects configurations that achieve an optimal balance between the model and filter sizes while minimizing reject time. Experiments on real-world datasets show that CLBF reduces memory usage by up to 24% and decreases reject time by up to 14 times compared to state-of-the-art learned Bloom filters.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic causal structure emerging through compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between causality, symmetry, and compression. We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where causality emerges as a consequence of compressing data across multiple environments. We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not be explicitly identifiable.</description>

      <title>From Probability to Counterfactuals: the Increasing Complexity of Satisfiability in Pearl's Causal Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) formalizes three types of reasoning: probabilistic (i.e. purely observational), interventional, and counterfactual, that reflect the progressive sophistication of human thought regarding causation. We investigate the computational complexity aspects of reasoning in this framework focusing mainly on satisfiability problems expressed in probabilistic and causal languages across the PCH. That is, given a system of formulas in the standard probabilistic and causal languages, does there exist a model satisfying the formulas?
  Our main contribution is to prove the exact computational complexities showing that languages allowing addition and marginalization (via the summation operator) yield NP^PP, PSPACE-, and NEXP-complete satisfiability problems, depending on the level of the PCH. These are the first results to demonstrate a strictly increasing complexity across the PCH: from probabilistic to causal and counterfactual reasoning. On the other hand, in the case of full languages, i.e. allowing addition, marginalization, and multiplication, we show that the satisfiability for the counterfactual level remains the same as for the probabilistic and causal levels, solving an open problem in the field.</description>

      <title>Tight Time Complexities in Parallel Stochastic Optimization with Arbitrary Computation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In distributed stochastic optimization, where parallel and asynchronous methods are employed, we establish optimal time complexities under virtually any computation behavior of workers/devices/CPUs/GPUs, capturing potential disconnections due to hardware and network delays, time-varying computation powers, and any possible fluctuations and trends of computation speeds. These real-world scenarios are formalized by our new universal computation model. Leveraging this model and new proof techniques, we discover tight lower bounds that apply to virtually all synchronous and asynchronous methods, including Minibatch SGD, Asynchronous SGD (Recht et al., 2011), and Picky SGD (Cohen et al., 2021). We show that these lower bounds, up to constant factors, are matched by the optimal Rennala SGD and Malenia SGD methods (Tyurin &amp; Richt\'arik, 2023).</description>

      <title>Classical Simulability of Quantum Circuits with Shallow Magic Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic is a necessary resource for quantum computers to be not efficiently simulable by classical computers. Previous results have linked the amount of quantum magic, characterized by the number of $T$ gates or stabilizer rank, to classical simulability. However, the effect of the distribution of quantum magic on the hardness of simulating a quantum circuit remains open. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of quantum circuits with alternating Clifford and $T$ layers across three tasks: amplitude estimation, sampling, and evaluating Pauli observables. In the case where all $T$ gates are distributed in a single layer, performing amplitude estimation and sampling to multiplicative error are already classically intractable under reasonable assumptions, but Pauli observables are easy to evaluate. Surprisingly, with the addition of just one $T$ gate layer or merely replacing all $T$ gates with $T^{\frac{1}{2}}$, the Pauli evaluation task reveals a sharp complexity transition from P to GapP-complete. Nevertheless, when the precision requirement is relaxed to 1/poly($n$) additive error, we are able to give a polynomial time classical algorithm to compute amplitudes, Pauli observable, and sampling from $\log(n)$ sized marginal distribution for any magic-depth-one circuit that is decomposable into a product of diagonal gates. Our research provides new techniques to simulate highly magical circuits while shedding light on their complexity and their significant dependence on the magic depth.</description>
