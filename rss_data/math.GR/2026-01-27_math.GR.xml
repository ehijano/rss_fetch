      <title>The quaternionic systems of imprimitivity for the reflection groups of rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an explicit presentation of a reflection group of rank two (or any rank two group for that matter), we give a simple procedure for calculating all its systems of imprimitivity, when viewed as a matrix group over the quaternions. This is applied to all the reflection groups, in particular the quaternionic reflection groups, thereby unifying a number of results and ideas in the literature. For example, a primitive complex reflection group of rank two has either uncountably many quaternionic systems of imprimitivity (3 cases) or none (16 cases).</description>

      <title>Tensor completions of 2-nilpotent finitely generated torsion-free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study tensor completions $G \otimes_{\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R$ of finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent groups $G$ of class $2$ in the quasivariety $\mathcal{N}_{2,R}$ of $R$-exponential 2-nilpotent groups over a binomial integral domain $R$. We show that the classical Hall completion $G\otimes_{\mathcal{H}} R$ embeds as an abstract group (the embedding is not an $R$-homomorphism) into $G \otimes_{\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R$, such that $G\otimes_{\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R \simeq (G \otimes_{\mathcal{H}} R) \times D$, where $D$ is an $R$-module and the direct product is a product of abstract groups (not $R$-groups!). In particular, the canonical $R$-epimorphism $\mu: G \otimes_{\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R \to G \otimes_{\mathcal{H}} R$ is a retract on $G \otimes_{\mathcal{H}} R$ with abelian kernel $D$. Moreover, in addition to the algebraic structure, we describe precisely how raising to an $R$-exponent works in the group $G \otimes_{\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R$. To do this, we introduce a new type of commutators, the so-called c-commutators, which are interesting in their own right. These results answer an old question of Remeslennikov about the algebraic structure of free 2-nilpotent R-groups in the quasivariety $\mathcal{N}_{2,R}$. Indeed, it was shown in \cite{AMN} that if $G$ is a free 2-nilpotent group with basis $X$ (in the variety of abstract 2-nilpotent groups), then $G \otimes_{\mathbb{N}_{2,R}} R$ is a free 2-nilpotent R-group in $\mathcal{N}_{2,R}$ with basis $X$. Note that in this case $G \otimes_{\mathcal{H}} R$ is a free 2-nilpotent Hall $R$-group with basis $X$. As an illustration, for a free 2-nilpotent group $G$ of rank 2, we describe the group $G \otimes_{\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R$, the action of $R$ on $G \otimes_{\mathcal{H}} R$, and the module $D$ in the case where $R$ is either the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Q}[t]$ or the field of rational functions $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ with coefficients in the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Groups and quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are intereseted in quandles and their enveloping groups. Various results are proven. We show that a quandle $Q$ and its image in the enveloping group $G(Q)$ have isomorphic enveloping groups. The image quandle is injective. For $Q$ a finite quandle, we show that $G(Q)$ admits a faithfull representation $\rho : G(Q)\to GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for some $n$; an irreducible representation of $G(Q)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is finite dimensional an its degree divides the order of the group $Inn(Q)$ of inner automorphism of $Q$. We determine the Malcev Lie algebra and the rational cohomology ring of $G(Q)$ for $Q$ finite. We prove that a finite injective quandle is a subquandle (for conjugacy) of a finite group. We also prove that the only finite subquandles (for conjugacy) of uniquely divisible groups are trivial quandles and that morphisms from quandles to nilpotent groups (for conjugacy) are constant on the indecomposable components. Implication of these results are considered.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric rigidity of the integers: an elementary primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chatawate (Flame) Ruethaimetapat was a passionate, enthusiastic, and wonderful person who passed away in August of 2024. At the time of their passing they were working towards their PhD, specializing in geometric group theory. Flame was just as excited about learning new mathematics as they were about sharing it with everyone else, so it's no surprise that they spent a lot of time thinking about how to write down expository proofs of classical theorems that would be accessible for first year students. In particular, they sought a simple, elementary proof of the fact that any finitely generated group quasi-isometric to the integers is virtually the integers. In the spirit of this endeavor and in loving memory of Flame, we present such a proof here.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-safe Key Exchange Scheme using Mihailova Subgroups in Braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper,we propose a modified Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld(AAG) key exchange scheme. The hardness assumption underlying this modified construction is based on the membership problem for Mihailova subgroups of the braid group, a problem that is algorithmically unsolvable. According to the security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is resistant to all known attacks, including quantum computational attacks.</description>

      <title>Sofic actions, halo products, and metric approximations of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a ``sofic $\mathcal{C}$-action'' of one group on another by automorphisms, for $\mathcal{C}$ a class of groups. We show that if $\mathcal{C}$ is the class of (i) sofic, (ii) hyperlinear, (iii) linear sofic or (iv) weakly sofic groups, then the class $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under taking semidirect products with sofic $\mathcal{C}$-action. We use this to construct a wide variety of new examples of groups in the classes (i)-(iv), many of them arising as ``halo products'' in the sense of Genevois-Tessera. We have a parallel set of results producing new examples of semidirect products which are locally embeddable into finite groups. Our framework also unifies existing results in the literature, due to Hayes-Sale; Brude-Sasyk and Gao-Kunnawalkam Elayavalli-Patchell.</description>

      <title>On the inclusion of bounded harmonic functions of random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the space of bounded harmonic functions of a probability measure $\mu$ on a group $G$ is contained in that of another measure $\theta$. We establish that asymptotic commutativity, defined by the condition $\|\mu^{*t}*\theta - \theta*\mu^{*t}\|_{TV} \to 0$ as $t \to \infty$, is sufficient to guarantee the inclusion $H^\infty(G, \mu) \subseteq H^\infty(G, \theta)$, provided $\theta$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a convex combination of convolution powers of $\mu$. By employing martingale convergence techniques rather than ergodic-theoretic arguments, we demonstrate that this result holds without topological assumptions on $G$ (such as local compactness) and extends to general Markov chains. Furthermore, utilizing hitting models for the Poisson boundary, we characterise the inclusion $H^\infty(G, \mu) \subseteq H^\infty(G, \theta)$ as equivalent to the asymptotic invariance of $\theta$ under $\mu$ in the weak* topology. We apply these results to provide a probabilistic proof of the Choquet-Deny theorem for nilpotent groups, among other applications.</description>

      <title>Massless Representations in Conformal Space and Their de Sitter (dS) Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</description>

      <title>Low-Bit Quantization of Bandlimited Graph Signals via Iterative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantization of real-valued bandlimited signals on graphs, focusing on low-bit representations. We propose iterative noise-shaping algorithms for quantization, including sampling approaches with and without vertex replacement. The methods leverage the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian and exploit graph incoherence to achieve high-fidelity approximations. Theoretical guarantees are provided for the random sampling method, and extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Green geometry, Martin boundary and random walk asymptotics on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a single computationally checkable analytic quantity interlacing Martin boundary collapse, Green geometry, and linear escape for transient random walks on finitely generated groups: the Green-variation functional \[ \Delta(S;a,b):=\max_{x\in\partial S}\frac{|G(a,x)-G(b,x)|}{G(a,x)}. \] We prove that $\Delta\to0$ along exhaustions characterises the strong Liouville property (under mild, verifiable hypotheses on the ``strong Liouville $\Rightarrow \Delta\to0$'' direction), turning boundary oscillation estimates for Green kernels into potential-theoretic rigidity.
  We then give two general criteria for $\Delta$-vanishing. The first one derives quantitative bounds on $\Delta$ from coarse heat-kernel envelopes at an intrinsic scale together with a Tauberian comparability, covering Gaussian/sub-Gaussian and stable-like regimes; and the second one is purely elliptic: an ``elliptic H\"older exhaustion'' criterion. Conversely, on groups of exponential growth, $\Delta$ fails to decay along balls already under stretched-exponential on-diagonal upper bounds, yielding a quantitative obstruction to strong Liouville.
  As consequences, trivial Martin boundary forces linear-scale collapse of Green geometry ($d_G(e,x)=o(|x|)$) and vanishing Green speed (in probability), without any entropy hypothesis. On the non-Liouville side we prove an abundance principle: the existence of a single minimal positive harmonic function at a prescribed growth scale forces infinitely many. Finally, we clarify the role of moment assumptions in speed theory: any linear-speed law of large numbers on a set of positive probability forces $\mathbb E|X_1|&lt;\infty$, while on torsion-free nilpotent groups one can have $\mathbb E|X_1|=\infty$ yet $|X_n|/n\to0$ in probability.</description>

Abstract: We correct an error in the paper [BLO3], and take the opportunity to examine in more detail the derived functors of inverse limits over orbit categories of (infinite) locally finite groups. The main results show how to reduce this in many cases to limits over orbit categories of finite groups, but we also look at generalizations of the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for higher limits over orbit categories for an extension of locally finite groups.</description>

      <title>Finiteness properties of Subgroups of Houghton Groups of full Hirsch length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1980's K.S. Brown proved that the Houghton group $H_n$ is of type $\operatorname{F}_{n-1}$ but not $\operatorname{FP}_n$. We show that, provided $n\ge3$, the same conclusion holds for all subgroups $G$ of $H_n$ that are 'large' in the sense that there is an epimorphism $G\twoheadrightarrow\mathbb{Z}^{n-1}$.
  Our research leads naturally to the study of generalised permutational wreath products in which the base of the wreath product is a direct product of finite groups which are allowed to vary in isomorphism type from one orbit to another. Such generalised wreath products arise naturally amongst the large subgroups of Houghton groups and are accommodated by a generalised Jordan--Wielandt theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and $k$ an integer. In this note, we show that for any $G$-Tambara functor $T$ and any subgroups $H_1, H_2 \leq G$, $k$ is a unit in $T(G/H_1)$ if and only if $k$ is a unit in $T(G/H_2)$. In other words, one may speak unambiguously of the localization $T[1/k]$. As a consequence, the norm functors $N_H^G$ commute with inverting $k$.</description>

      <title>On the monodromy and spin parity of single-cylinder origamis in the minimal stratum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a paper with Menasco-Nieland, the first author constructed factorially many origamis in the minimal stratum of the moduli space of translation surfaces having simultaneously a single vertical cylinder and a single horizontal cylinder. Moreover, these origamis were constructed using the minimal number of squares required for origamis in the minimal stratum. We shall call such origamis minimal $[1,1]$-origamis.
  In this work, we calculate all of the spin parities of the Aougab-Menasco-Nieland origamis, and we therefore determine the connected component of the minimal stratum within which each is contained. Motivated by understanding the $\SL(2,\Z)$-orbits of these origamis, we investigate their monodromy groups, in particular proving that all of them are alternating or projective special linear groups. In fact, we prove more generally that the monodromy group of a minimal $[1,1]$-origami must almost always be a finite simple group. Finally, we determine the Kontsevich-Zorich monodromies of these origamis in low genus and give a conjecture in general.
  Note that previous works in the literature (e.g., that of Eskin-Kontsevich-Zorich, Filip-Forni-Matheus, Guti\'{e}rrez-Romo, Kany-Matheus, Matheus-Yoccoz-Zmiaikou, and Zorich) often chose to discuss just one of these $\SL(2,\Z)$-invariants at a time: in particular, to the best our knowledge, this is one of the first places where all of these $\SL(2,\Z)$-invariants are computed explicitly in a single paper for such a large family of origamis.</description>

      <title>Coning off totally geodesic boundary components of a hyperbolic manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let M be a compact hyperbolic manifold with totally geodesic boundary. If the injectivity radius of the boundary is larger than an explicit function of the normal injectivity radius of the boundary, we show that there is a negatively curved metric on the space obtained by coning each boundary component of M to a point. Moreover, we give explicit geometric conditions under which a locally convex subset of M gives rise to a locally convex subset of the cone-off.
  Group-theoretically, we conclude that the fundamental group of the cone-off is hyperbolic and the image of the fundamental group of the coned-off locally convex subset is a quasi-convex subgroup.</description>

      <title>The curve complex as a coset intersection complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a collection of subgroups of the mapping class group of a surface such that the associated coset intersection complex is quasi-isometric and homotopy equivalent to the curve complex. Moreover, we prove that these two complexes are combinatorially equivalent in the sense that one can be obtained from the other via taking a nerve. As an application, we prove that the automorphism group of this coset intersection complex is the extended mapping class group, providing new examples for Ivanov's metaconjecture.</description>

      <title>Procountable groups are not classifiable by countable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that topological isomorphism on $2$-nilpotent procountable groups is not classifiable by countable structures, in the sense of descriptive set theory. In fact, the equivalence relation $\ell_\infty$ that expresses that two sequences of reals have bounded difference is Borel reducible to it. This marks substantial progress on an open problem of [16]: to determine the exact complexity of the isomorphism relation among all non-archimedean Polish groups.</description>

      <title>On the Diophantine problem related to power circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</description>

      <title>Adventures of Harish-Chandra in $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$-graded world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$ bi-graded Lie algebras. We describe their properties in relation to Lie superalgebras with some compatible structures. Then we focus on the approach to the Lie group--algebra correspondence based on Harish-Chandra pairs and provide some examples of application of it in the bi-graded setting.</description>
