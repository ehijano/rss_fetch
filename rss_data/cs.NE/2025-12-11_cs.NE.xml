      <title>AI Co-Artist: A LLM-Powered Framework for Interactive GLSL Shader Animation Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creative coding and real-time shader programming are at the forefront of interactive digital art, enabling artists, designers, and enthusiasts to produce mesmerizing, complex visual effects that respond to real-time stimuli such as sound or user interaction. However, despite the rich potential of tools like GLSL, the steep learning curve and requirement for programming fluency pose substantial barriers for newcomers and even experienced artists who may not have a technical background. In this paper, we present AI Co-Artist, a novel interactive system that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to support the iterative evolution and refinement of GLSL shaders through a user-friendly, visually-driven interface. Drawing inspiration from the user-guided evolutionary principles pioneered by the Picbreeder platform, our system empowers users to evolve shader art using intuitive interactions, without needing to write or understand code. AI Co-Artist serves as both a creative companion and a technical assistant, allowing users to explore a vast generative design space of real-time visual art. Through comprehensive evaluations, including structured user studies and qualitative feedback, we demonstrate that AI Co-Artist significantly reduces the technical threshold for shader creation, enhances creative outcomes, and supports a wide range of users in producing professional-quality visual effects. Furthermore, we argue that this paradigm is broadly generalizable. By leveraging the dual strengths of LLMs-semantic understanding and program synthesis, our method can be applied to diverse creative domains, including website layout generation, architectural visualizations, product prototyping, and infographics.</description>

      <title>Banach neural operator for Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical neural networks are known for their ability to approximate mappings between finite-dimensional spaces, but they fall short in capturing complex operator dynamics across infinite-dimensional function spaces. Neural operators, in contrast, have emerged as powerful tools in scientific machine learning for learning such mappings. However, standard neural operators typically lack mechanisms for mixing or attending to input information across space and time. In this work, we introduce the Banach neural operator (BNO) -- a novel framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with deep neural networks to predict nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics from partial observations. The BNO approximates a nonlinear operator between Banach spaces by combining spectral linearization (via Koopman theory) with deep feature learning (via convolutional neural networks and nonlinear activations). This sequence-to-sequence model captures dominant dynamic modes and allows for mesh-independent prediction. Numerical experiments on the Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the method's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In particular, BNO achieves robust zero-shot super-resolution in unsteady flow prediction and consistently outperforms conventional Koopman-based methods and deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Improving a Parallel C++ Intel AVX-512 SIMD Linear Genetic Programming Interpreter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend recent 256 SSE vector work to 512 AVX giving a four fold speedup. We use MAGPIE (Machine Automated General Performance Improvement via Evolution of software) to speedup a C++ linear genetic programming interpreter. Local search is provided with three alternative hand optimised codes, revision history and the Intel 512 bit AVX512VL documentation as C++ XML. Magpie is applied to the new Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallel interpreter for Peter Nordin's linear genetic programming GPengine. Linux mprotect sandboxes whilst performance is given by perf instruction count. In both cases, in a matter of hours local search reliably sped up 114 or 310 lines of manually written parallel SIMD code for the Intel Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) by 2 percent.</description>

      <title>Beyond Algorithm Evolution: An LLM-Driven Framework for the Co-Evolution of Swarm Intelligence Optimization Algorithms and Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of automated algorithm design has been advanced by frameworks such as EoH, FunSearch, and Reevo. Yet, their focus on algorithm evolution alone, neglecting the prompts that guide them, limits their effectiveness with LLMs, especially in complex, uncertain environments where they nonetheless implicitly rely on strategies from swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. Recognizing this, we argue that swarm intelligence optimization provides a more generalized and principled foundation for automated design. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative evolution of both swarm intelligence algorithms and guiding prompts using a single LLM. To enhance interpretability, we also propose a simple yet efficient evaluation method for prompt templates. The framework was rigorously evaluated on a range of NP problems, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art automated design approaches. Experiments with various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-32B, GPT-5) reveal significantly divergent evolutionary trajectories in the generated prompts, further underscoring the necessity of a structured co-evolution framework. Importantly, our approach maintains leading performance across different models, demonstrating reduced reliance on the most powerful LLMs and enabling more cost-effective deployments. Ablation studies and in-depth analysis of the evolved prompts confirm that collaborative evolution is essential for achieving optimal performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, underscoring the indispensable role of prompt evolution.</description>

      <title>From Forecast to Action: Uncertainty-Aware UAV Deployment for Ocean Drifter Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel predict-then-optimize framework for maritime search operations that integrates trajectory forecasting with UAV deployment optimization-an end-to-end approach not addressed in prior work. A large language model predicts the drifter's trajectory, and spatial uncertainty is modeled using Gaussian-based particle sampling. Unlike traditional static deployment methods, we dynamically adapt UAV detection radii based on distance and optimize their placement using meta-heuristic algorithms. Experiments on real-world data from the Korean coastline demonstrate that our method, particularly the repair mechanism designed for this problem, significantly outperforms the random search baselines. This work introduces a practical and robust integration of trajectory prediction and spatial optimization for intelligent maritime rescue.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Genetic Evolution of Neural Networks for Optimal SFC Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliance of organisations on computer networks is enabled by network programmability, which is typically achieved through Service Function Chaining. These chains virtualise network functions, link them, and programmatically embed them on networking infrastructure. Optimal embedding of Service Function Chains is an NP-hard problem, with three sub-problems, chain composition, virtual network function embedding, and link embedding, that have to be optimised simultaneously, rather than sequentially, for optimal results. Genetic Algorithms have been employed for this, but existing approaches either do not optimise all three sub-problems or do not optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach called GENESIS, which evolves three sine-function-activated Neural Networks, and funnels their output to a Gaussian distribution and an A* algorithm to optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We evaluate GENESIS on an emulator across 48 different data centre scenarios and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithms and one greedy algorithm. GENESIS produces an optimal solution for 100% of the scenarios, whereas the second-best method optimises only 71% of the scenarios. Moreover, GENESIS is the fastest among all Genetic Algorithms, averaging 15.84 minutes, compared to an average of 38.62 minutes for the second-best Genetic Algorithm.</description>

      <title>Scalable Construction of Spiking Neural Networks using up to thousands of GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse scientific and engineering research areas deal with discrete, time-stamped changes in large systems of interacting delay differential equations. Simulating such complex systems at scale on high-performance computing clusters demands efficient management of communication and memory. Inspired by the human cerebral cortex -- a sparsely connected network of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ neurons, each forming $\mathcal{O}(10^{3})$--$\mathcal{O}(10^{4})$ synapses and communicating via short electrical pulses called spikes -- we study the simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks for computational neuroscience research. This work presents a novel network construction method for multi-GPU clusters and upcoming exascale supercomputers using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), where each process builds its local connectivity and prepares the data structures for efficient spike exchange across the cluster during state propagation. We demonstrate scaling performance of two cortical models using point-to-point and collective communication, respectively.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Bayesian Optimization for Quantum Circuit Architecture Search with Uncertainty Calibrated Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit design is a key bottleneck for practical quantum machine learning on complex, real-world data. We present an automated framework that discovers and refines variational quantum circuits (VQCs) using graph-based Bayesian optimization with a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate. Circuits are represented as graphs and mutated and selected via an expected improvement acquisition function informed by surrogate uncertainty with Monte Carlo dropout. Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery.</description>

      <title>Drawback of Enforcing Equivariance and its Compensation via the Lens of Expressive Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant neural networks encode symmetry as an inductive bias and have achieved strong empirical performance in wide domains. However, their expressive power remains not well understood. Focusing on 2-layer ReLU networks, this paper investigates the impact of equivariance constraints on the expressivity of equivariant and layer-wise equivariant networks. By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power. However, we demonstrate that this drawback can be compensated via enlarging the model size. Furthermore, we show that despite a larger model size, the resulting architecture could still correspond to a hypothesis space with lower complexity, implying superior generalizability for equivariant networks.</description>

      <title>Structural Plasticity as Active Inference: A Biologically-Inspired Architecture for Homeostatic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.</description>

      <title>The emergence of sparse attention: impact of data distribution and benefits of repetition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergence is a fascinating property of large language models and neural networks more broadly: as models scale and train for longer, they sometimes develop new abilities in sudden ways. Despite initial studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how and when these abilities emerge. To address this gap, we study the emergence over training of sparse attention, a critical and frequently observed attention pattern in Transformers. By combining theoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small Transformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics driving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows power laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We additionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we confirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task. Our findings provide a simple, theoretically grounded framework for understanding how data distributions and model design influence the learning dynamics behind one form of emergence.</description>

      <title>A Practitioner's Guide to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The so-called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), whose design is merely inspired, rather than dictated, by the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN landscape. By collecting and categorizing a large set of open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting modern KAN development. We organize the review around four core themes:
  (i) presenting a precise history of Kolmogorov's superposition theory toward neural-network formulations; (ii) establishing the formal equivalence between KANs and MLPs; (iii) analyzing the critical role of basis functions; and (iv) organizing recent advancements in accuracy, efficiency, regularization, and convergence.
  Finally, we provide a practical Choose-Your-KAN guide to assist practitioners in selecting appropriate architectures, and we close by identifying current research gaps and future directions. The associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review) complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research.</description>

      <title>Spectral Concentration at the Edge of Stability: Information Geometry of Kernel Associative Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a \textit{Ridge of Optimization} characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to \textit{Spectral Concentration}, its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the Edge of Stability, a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.</description>
