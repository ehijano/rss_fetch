      <title>Parallel Seismic Data Processing Performance with Cloud-based Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a general processing framework to effectively utilize waveform data stored on modern cloud platforms. The focus is hybrid processing schemes where a local system drives processing. We show that downloading files and doing all processing locally is problematic even when the local system is a high-performance compute cluster. Benchmark tests with parallel processing show that approach always creates a bottleneck as the volume of data being handled increases with more processes pulling data. We find a hybrid model where processing to reduce the volume of data transferred from the cloud servers to the local system can dramatically improve processing time. Tests implemented with Massively Parallel Analysis System for Seismology (MsPASS) utilizing Amazon Web Service's Lamba service yield throughput comparable to processing day files on a local HPC file system. Given the ongoing migration of seismology data to cloud storage, our results show doing some or all processing on the cloud will be essential for any processing involving large volumes of data.</description>

      <title>A generic framework for extending Miles' approach to wind-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the energy transfer from wind to waves is an important but complex topic, typically based on phenomenology or on technically challenging analysis, performed case by case. Here we show that the approach by Miles, initially proposed for a still and infinitely deep ocean of inviscid water, is in fact generic: it can easily be adapted, as we derive directly from the mathematical structure of the arguments put forward by Miles. We establish simple transformations, which deduce growth rates in complex hydrodynamic situations directly from those in Miles' conditions. The corresponding conversion factors are determined from the hydrodynamic water pressure under the effect of a propagating surface wave, and can be determined without needing to further analyse wind and air flow. We reproduce a variety of results for different hydrodynamic situations to show how such generalisations can be achieved with surprisingly little calculations and without any additional numerical effort, which should make the approach interesting for real-life applications.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical eddy-viscosity and backscattering closures for 2D geophysical turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-based closures such as eddy-viscosity and backscattering models are widely used for large-eddy simulation (LES) of geophysical turbulence for applications including weather and climate prediction. However, these closures have parameters that are often chosen empirically. Here, for the first time, we semi-analytically derive the parameters of the Leith and Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity closures and the Jansen-Held backscattering closure for 2D geophysical turbulence. The semi-analytical derivation provides these parameters up to a constant that can be estimated from the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum of a few snapshots of direct numerical simulation (DNS) or other high-fidelity (eddy resolving) simulations, or even obtained from earlier analytical work based on renormalization group. The semi-analytically estimated closure parameters agree with those obtained from online (a-posteriori) learning in several setups of 2D geophysical turbulence in our earlier work. LES with closures that use these parameters can correctly reproduce the key statistics of DNS, including those of the extreme events and interscale energy and enstrophy transfers, and outperform the baselines (dynamic Leith and Smagorinsky and the latter with standard parameter).</description>

      <title>Seismic Facies Analysis: A Deep Domain Adaptation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10510v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn accurately from large quantities of labeled input data, but often fail to do so when labelled data are scarce. DNNs sometimes fail to generalize ontest data sampled from different input distributions. Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA)techniques have been proven useful when no labels are available, and when distribution shifts are observed in the target domain (TD). In the present study, experiments are performed on seismic images of the F3 block 3D dataset from offshore Netherlands (source domain; SD) and Penobscot 3D survey data from Canada (target domain; TD). Three geological classes from SD and TD that have similar reflection patterns are considered. A deep neural network architecture named EarthAdaptNet (EAN) is proposed to semantically segment the seismic images when few classes have data scarcity, and we use a transposed residual unit to replace the traditional dilated convolution in the decoder block. The EAN achieved a pixel-level accuracy &gt;84% and an accuracy of ~70% for the minority classes, showing improved performance compared to existing architectures. In addition, we introduce the CORAL (Correlation Alignment) method to the EAN to create an unsupervised deep domain adaptation network (EAN-DDA) for the classification of seismic reflections from F3 and Penobscot, to demonstrate possible approaches when labelled data are unavailable. Maximum class accuracy achieved was ~99% for class 2 of Penobscot, with an overall accuracy&gt;50%. Taken together, the EAN-DDA has the potential to classify target domain seismic facies classes with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Can spinodal decomposition occur during decompression-induced vesiculation of magma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Volcanic eruptions are driven by decompression-induced vesiculation of supersaturated volatile components in magma. The initial phase of this phenomenon has long been described as nucleation and growth. Recently, it was proposed that spinodal decomposition (an energetically spontaneous phase separation that does not require the formation of a distinct interface) may occur during decompression-induced magma vesiculation. This suggestion has attracted attention, but is currently based only on textural observations of decompression experiment products (e.g., independence of bubble number density on decompression rate and homogeneous spatial distribution of bubbles). In this study, I used a simple thermodynamic approach to investigate whether spinodal decomposition can occur during decompression-induced vesiculation of magma. I plotted binodal and spinodal curves on the chemical composition-pressure plane by approximating hydrous magmas under several temperature and compositional conditions as two-component symmetric regular solutions of silicate and water, using experimentally determined water solubility values. The spinodal curve was consistently much lower than the binodal curve at pressures sufficiently below the second critical endpoint. In addition, the final pressure of all decompression experiments performed to date fell between these two curves. This suggests that spinodal decomposition is unlikely to occur in the pressure range of magmatic processes in the continental crust, and that decompression-induced vesiculation results from nucleation and subsequent growth, as previously considered. Furthermore, by substituting the determined spinodal pressure into the formula of non-classical nucleation theory, the surface tension between silicate melt and bubble nucleus can be estimated.</description>
