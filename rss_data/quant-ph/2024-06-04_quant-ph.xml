      <title>Non-hermitian topology and entanglement in an optomechanical superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topology, dissipation and nonlinearities can give rise to a wealth of new phenomena and pave the way for novel topological lasers, sensors and other quantum devices. Along these lines, we propose here an optomechanical setup in which the concomitant presence of a spatially modulated external drive and dissipation gives rise to a topologically nontrivial state for mechanical and optical excitations. We are able to show that the one-dimensional system considered here exhibits topologically protected end states for which mechanical and optical degrees of freedom are entangled. We show such entanglement to be robust with respect to the presence of nonzero-temperature baths and we propose a protocol for experimental observation of the entanglement.</description>

      <title>Topological weak-mesaurement-induced geometric phases revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical study of a class of geometric phase induced by weak measurements. In particular, we analyze the dependence of the geometric phase on the winding $W$ of the polar angle $\varphi$, upon a sequence of $N$ weak measurements of increased magnitude ($c$), resulting in the appearance of a multiplicity of critical measurement-strength parameters where the geometric phase becomes stochastic. Adding to the novelty of our approach, we not only analyze the weak-measurement induced geometric phase by a full analytic derivation, valid in the quasicontinuous limit ($N \rightarrow \infty$), but also we analyze the induced geometric phase numerically, thus enabling us to unravel the finite-$N$ interplay of the geometric phase with the measurement strength parameter, and its stability to perturbations in the measurements protocol.</description>

      <title>Learning topological states from randomized measurements using variational tensor network tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00193v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.</description>

      <title>General Framework for Quantifying Dissipation Pathways in Open Quantum Systems. I. Theoretical Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general and practical theoretical framework to investigate how energy is dissipated in open quantum system dynamics. This is done by quantifying the contributions of individual bath components to the overall dissipation of the system. The framework is based on the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator technique which allows us to express the rate of energy dissipation into a specific bath degree of freedom by using traces of operator products. The approach captures system-bath interactions to all orders, but is based on second-order perturbation theory on the off-diagonal subsystem's couplings and a Markovian description of the bath. The usefulness of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to various models of open quantum systems involving harmonic oscillator or spin baths, and connecting the outcomes to existing results such as our previously reported formula derived for locally coupled harmonic bath [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 084109 (2021)]. We also prove that the dissipation calculated by our theory rigorously satisfies thermodynamic principles such as energy conservation and detailed balance. Overall, the strategy can be used to develop the theory and simulation of dissipation pathways to interpret and engineer the dynamics of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>General Framework for Quantifying Dissipation Pathways in Open Quantum Systems. II. Numerical Validation and the Role of Non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous paper [C. W. Kim and I. Franco, J. Chem. Phys. 160, XXXXXX (2024)], we developed a theory called MQME-D, which allows us to decompose the overall energy dissipation process in open quantum system dynamics into contributions by individual components of the bath when the subsystem dynamics is governed by a Markovian quantum master equation (MQME). Here, we contrast the predictions of MQME-D against the numerically exact results obtained by combining hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with a recently reported protocol for monitoring the statistics of the bath. Overall, MQME-D accurately captures the contributions of specific bath components to the overall dissipation while greatly reducing the computational cost as compared to exact computations using HEOM. The computations show that MQME-D exhibits errors originating from its inherent Markov approximation. We demonstrate that its accuracy can be significantly increased by incorporating non-Markovianity by exploiting time scale separations (TSS) in different components of the bath. Our work demonstrates that MQME-D combined with TSS can be reliably used to understanding how energy is dissipated in realistic open quantum system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Magnetization in a non-equilibrium quantum spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics described by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian typically capture the short-term behavior of open quantum systems before quantum jumps occur. In contrast, the long-term dynamics, characterized by the Lindblad master equation (LME), drive the system towards a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), which is an eigenstate with zero energy of the Liouvillian superoperator, denoted as $\mathcal{L}$. Conventionally, these two types of evolutions exhibit distinct dynamical behaviors. However, in this study, we challenge this common belief and demonstrate that the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can accurately represent the long-term dynamics of a critical two-level open quantum system. The criticality of the system arises from the exceptional point (EP) of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Additionally, the NESS is identical to the coalescent state of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We apply this finding to a series of critical open quantum systems and show that a local dissipation channel can induce collective alignment of all spins in the same direction. This direction can be well controlled by modulating the quantum jump operator. The corresponding NESS is a product state and maintains long-time coherence, facilitating quantum control in open many-body systems. This discovery paves the way for a better understanding of the long-term dynamics of critical open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithm for Determining Eigenstate Energies in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing efficient quantum computing algorithms is crucial for addressing computationally challenging problems across various fields. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum XZ24 algorithm, designed for efficiently computing the eigen-energy spectra of any quantum systems. The algorithm employs an auxiliary qubit as a control qubit to execute a pair of time-reversing real-time evolutions of Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ on the target qubits. The reference state wavefunction $|\phi_0 \rangle$ is stored in target qubits. When the control qubit (i.e., the auxiliary qubit) is in the 0 (1) state, the $e^{-i\hat{H}t/2} (e^{i\hat{H}t/2})$ evolution operator is applied. By combining Hadamard gates and phase gates on the auxiliary qubit, information about $\langle \psi_0 | \cos(\hat{H}t) | \psi_0 \rangle$ can be obtained from the output auxiliary qubit state. Theoretically, applying the Fourier transformation to the $\langle \psi_0 | \cos(\hat{H}t) | \psi_0 \rangle$ signal can resolve the eigen-energies of the Hamiltonian in the spectrum. We provide theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the algorithm, demonstrating its advantages in computational efficiency and accuracy. Compared to existing quantum methods, the new algorithm stands out for its remarkably low measurement cost. For quantum systems of any complexity, only a single auxiliary qubit needs to be measured, resulting in a measurement complexity of $O(1)$. Moreover, this method can simultaneously obtain multiple eigen-energies, dependent on the reference state. We anticipate that the new algorithm will drive significant progress in quantum system simulation and offer promising applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>On Transversality Across Two Distinct Quantum Error Correction Codes For Quantum Repeaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transversality of pairs of CSS codes and their use in the second generation of quantum repeaters (QR)s. We show that different stations of quantum link can experience different errors. Considering this fact, we suggest to use different CSS codes in different stations. We also suggest to use $[[n, k]]$ codes with $k &gt; 1$ as they are more efficient then codes with $k = 1$. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions for a pair of CSS codes to be non-local CNOT-transversal. We show that in contrast to the well known CNOT transversality which states that two CSS codes should be the same, less restrictive constraints are needed. Next, we establish sufficient and necessary conditions for a code pair to be CZ-transversal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient neural network (NN) architecture for classifying wave functions in terms of their localization. Our approach integrates a versatile quantum phase space parametrization leading to a custom 'quantum' NN, with the pattern recognition capabilities of a modified convolutional model. This design accepts wave functions of any dimension as inputs and makes accurate predictions at an affordable computational cost. This scalability becomes crucial to explore the localization rate at the semiclassical limit, a long standing question in the quantum scattering field. Moreover, the physical meaning built in the model allows for the interpretation of the learning process</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergotropy, as a measure for extractable work from a quantum system, has garnered significant attention due to its relevance in quantum thermodynamics and information processing. In this work, the dynamics of ergotropy will be investigated in a nonequilibrium environment for both Markovian and non-Markovian regime. In this study, both the coherent and incoherent parts of the ergotropy will be considered. It will be shown that for a non-equilibrium environment, the extraction of work is more efficient compared to when the environment is in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Creation and manipulation of surface code defects with quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface code is a spin-1/2 lattice system that can exhibit non-trivial topological order when defects are punctured in the lattice and thus can be used as a stabiliser code. The protocols developed to create defects in the system have previously relied on adiabatic dynamics. In this work we use techniques of quantum optimal control to overcome the requirement for adiabaticity and achieve defect creation and implemention of other important operations required for quantum computation at much faster timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an efficient and end-to-end quantum algorithm tailored for computing the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and conditional Value-at-Risk (CVar) for a portfolio of European options. Our focus is on leveraging quantum computation to overcome the challenges posed by high dimensionality in VaR and CVaR estimation. While our innovative quantum algorithm is designed primarily for estimating portfolio VaR and CVaR for European options, we also investigate the feasibility of applying a similar quantum approach to price American options. Our analysis reveals a quantum 'no-go' theorem within the current algorithm, highlighting its limitation in pricing American options. Our results indicate the necessity of investigating alternative strategies to resolve the complementarity challenge in pricing American options in future research.</description>

      <title>Chaos controlled and disorder driven phase transitions by breaking permutation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing disorder in a system typically breaks symmetries and can introduce dramatic changes in its properties such as localization. At the same time, the clean system can have distinct many-body features depending on how chaotic it is. In this work the effect of permutation symmetry breaking by disorder is studied in a system which has a controllable and deterministic regular to chaotic transition. Results indicate a continuous phase transition from an area-law to a volume-law entangled phase irrespective of whether there is chaos or not, as the strength of the disorder is increased. The critical disorder strength obtained by finite size scaling, indicate a strong dependence on whether the clean system is regular or chaotic to begin with. In the process, we also obtain the critical exponents associated with this phase transition. Additionally, we find that a relatively small disorder is seen to be sufficient to delocalize a chaotic system.</description>

      <title>A Near Quantum Limited Sub-GHz TiN Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier Operating in a Frequency Translating Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and experimental characterization of a kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifier (KI-TWPA) for sub-GHz frequencies. KI-TWPAs amplify signals through nonlinear mixing processes supported by the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting transmission line. The device described here utilizes a compactly meandered TiN microstrip transmission line to achieve the length needed to amplify sub-GHz signals. It is operated in a frequency translating mode where the amplified signal tone is terminated at the output of the amplifier, and the idler tone at approximately 2.5~GHz is brought out of the cryostat. By varying the pump frequency, a gain of up to 22 dB was achieved in a tunable range from about 450 to 850~MHz. Use of TiN as the nonlinear element allows for a reduction of the required pump power by roughly an order of magnitude relative to NbTiN, which has been used for previous KI-TWPA implementations. This amplifier has the potential to enable high-sensitivity and high-speed measurements in a wide range of applications, such as quantum computing, astrophysics, and dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Generation of tripartite entangled states with fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol based on a tunneling plus particle-detection process aimed at generating tripartite entanglement in a system of 3 indistinguishable fermions in a triple-well potential, initially prepared in a state exhibiting only exchange correlations. Particular attention is paid to the generation of fermionic ghz- and w-type states, which are analogous to the usual ghz- and w-type states defined in composites of distinguishable qubits. The protocol succeeds in generating fermionic w-type states, and the ensuing state becomes effectively equivalent to a 3-distinguishable-qubit w-type state shared among three localized parties. The protocol, however, is unable to generate ghz-type states, a result that highlights the fundamental inequivalence between these two types of states, and throws light into the characterization of processes that guarantee the emergence of specific kinds of multipartite entanglement in systems of identical parties. Our findings suggest new paths for the exploration, generation and exploitation of multipartite entanglement in composites of indistinguishable particles, as a useful resource for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Optomechanics driven by noisy and narrowband fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of a cavity optomechanical system driven by narrow-band electromagnetic fields, which are applied either in the form of uncorrelated noise, or as a more structured spectrum. The bandwidth of the driving spectra is smaller than the mechanical resonant frequency, and thus we can describe the resulting physics using concepts familiar from regular cavity optomechanics in the resolved-sideband limit. With a blue-detuned noise driving, the noise-induced interaction leads to anti-damping of the mechanical oscillator, and a self-oscillation threshold at an average noise power that is comparable to that of a coherent driving tone. This process can be seen as noise-induced dynamical amplification of mechanical motion. However, when the noise bandwidth is reduced down to the order of the mechanical damping, we discover a large shift of the power threshold of self-oscillation. This is due to the oscillator adiabatically following the instantaneous noise profile. In addition to blue-detuned noise driving, we investigate narrow-band driving consisting of two coherent drive tones nearby in frequency. Also in these cases, we observe deviations from a naive optomechanical description relying only on the tones' frequencies and powers.</description>

      <title>Group Sparse Matrix Optimization for Efficient Quantum State Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding ways to transform a quantum state to another is fundamental to quantum information processing. In this paper, we apply the sparse matrix approach to the quantum state transformation problem. In particular, we present a new approach for searching for unitary matrices for quantum state transformation by directly optimizing the objective problem using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Moreover, we consider the use of group sparsity as an alternative sparsity choice in quantum state transformation problems. Our approach incorporates sparsity constraints into quantum state transformation by formulating it as a non-convex problem. It establishes a useful framework for efficiently handling complex quantum systems and achieving precise state transformations.</description>

      <title>Resource-theoretic hierarchy of contextuality for general probabilistic theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a hierarchy of generalized contextuality. It refines the traditional binary distinction between contextual and noncontextual theories, and facilitates their comparison based on how contextual they are. Our approach focuses on the contextuality of prepare-and-measure scenarios, described by general probabilistic theories (GPTs). To motivate the hierarchy, we define it as the resource ordering of a novel resource theory of GPT-contextuality. The building blocks of its free operations are classical systems and GPT-embeddings. The latter are simulations of one GPT by another, which preserve the operational equivalences and thus cannot generate contextuality. Noncontextual theories can be recovered as least elements in the hierarchy. We then define a new contextuality monotone, called classical excess, given by the minimal error of embedding a GPT within an infinite classical system. In addition, we show that the optimal success probability in the parity oblivious multiplexing game also defines a monotone in our resource theory. We end with a discussion of a potential interpretation of the non-free operations of the resource theory of GPT-contextuality as expressing a kind of information erasure.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling laws for correlated decay of many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems are open, continually exchanging energy and information with the surrounding environment. This interaction leads to decoherence and decay of quantum states. In complex systems, formed by many particles, decay can become correlated and enhanced. A fundamental question then arises: what is the maximal decay rate of a large quantum system, and how does it scale with its size? In this work, we address these issues by reformulating the problem into finding the ground state energy of a generic spin Hamiltonian. Inspired by recent work in Hamiltonian complexity theory, we establish rigorous and general upper and lower bounds on the maximal decay rate. These bounds are universal, as they hold for a broad class of Markovian many-body quantum systems. For many physically-relevant systems, the bounds are asymptotically tight, resulting in exact scaling laws with system size. Specifically, for large atomic arrays in free space, these scalings depend only on the arrays' dimensionality and are insensitive to details at short length-scales. The scaling laws establish fundamental limits on the decay rates of quantum states and offer valuable insights for research in many-body quantum dynamics, metrology, and fault tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Chiral photon blockade in the spinning Kerr resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose how to achieve chiral photon blockade by spinning a nonlinear optical resonator. We show that by driving such a device at a fixed direction, completely different quantum effects can emerge for the counter-propagating optical modes, due to the spinning-induced breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which otherwise is unattainable for the same device in the static regime. Also, we find that in comparison with the static case, robust non-classical correlations against random backscattering losses can be achieved for such a quantum chiral system. Our work, extending previous works on the spontaneous breaking of optical chiral symmetry from the classical to purely quantum regimes, can stimulate more efforts towards making and utilizing various chiral quantum effects, including applications for chiral quantum networks or noise-tolerant quantum sensors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum-inspired algorithm for Graph Coloring Problems (GCPs) that utilizes qudits in a product state, with each qudit representing a node in the graph and parameterized by d-dimensional spherical coordinates. We propose and benchmark two optimization strategies: qudit gradient descent (QdGD), initiating qudits in random states and employing gradient descent to minimize a cost function, and qudit local quantum annealing (QdLQA), which adapts the local quantum annealing method to optimize an adiabatic transition from a tractable initial function to a problem-specific cost function. Our approaches are benchmarked against established solutions for standard GCPs, showing that our methods not only rival but frequently surpass the performance of recent state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. The adaptability of our algorithm and its high-quality solutions, achieved with minimal computational resources, point to an advancement in the field of quantum-inspired optimization, with potential applications extending to a broad spectrum of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Influence of joint measurement bases on sharing network nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharing network nonlocality in an extended quantum network scenario is the new paradigm in the development of quantum theory. In this paper, we investigate the influence of Elegant joint measurement(in short, EJM) bases in an extended bilocal scenario on sharing network nonlocality via sequential measurement. The work essentially based on the newly introduced[Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 220401(2021)] bilocal inequality with ternary inputs for end parties and EJM as joint measurement bases in $Alice_n-Bob-Charlie_m$ scenario. Here, we are able to capture all simultaneous violation of this inequality for $(n,m)\in \{(2,1),(1,2),(1,1),(2,2)\}$ cases. We further observe the criteria for sharing network nonlocality where we are able to find also the dependence of the sharing on the amount of entanglement of the joint bases. The effect of the nonlinearity in this inequality is also captured in our results with the symmetrical and asymmetrical violation in this extended scenario. The work will generate further the realization of quantum correlations in network scenario.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Inspired Quantum Noise Mitigation in Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) have been acknowledged as a leading strategy to utilize near-term quantum advantages in multiple problems, including machine learning and combinatorial optimization. When applied to specific tasks, the parameters in the quantum circuits are trained to minimize the target function. Although there have been comprehensive studies to improve the performance of the PQCs on practical tasks, the errors caused by the quantum noise downgrade the performance when running on real quantum computers. In particular, when the quantum state is transformed through multiple quantum circuit layers, the effect of the quantum noise happens cumulatively and becomes closer to the maximally mixed state or complete noise. This paper studies the relationship between the quantum noise and the diffusion model. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired learning approach to mitigate the quantum noise in the PQCs and reduce the error for specific tasks. Through our experiments, we illustrate the efficiency of the learning strategy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification tasks in the quantum noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>A complete scheme for atom-mediated deterministic photonic graph state generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-entangled multi-photon graph states are a crucial resource in photonic quantum computation and communication. Yet, the lack of photon-photon interactions makes the construction of such graph states especially challenging. Typically, these states are produced through probabilistic single-photon sources and linear-optics entangling operations that require indistinguishable photons. The resulting inefficiency of these methods necessitates a large overhead in the number of sources and operations, creating a major bottleneck in the photonic approach. Here, we show how harnessing single-atom-based photonic operations can enable deterministic generation of photonic graph states, while also lifting the requirement for photon indistinguishability. To this end, we introduce a multi-gate quantum node comprised of a single atom in a W-type level scheme coupled to an optical resonator. This configuration provides a versatile toolbox for generating graph states, allowing the operation of two fundamental photon-atom gates, as well as the deterministic generation of single photons. We investigate the implementation of this setup with a $^{87}$Rb atom and evaluate its performance through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Equilibrium Propagation: Gradient-Descent Training of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium propagation (EP) is a training framework for energy-based systems, i.e. systems whose physics minimizes an energy function. EP has been explored in various classical physical systems such as resistor networks, elastic networks, the classical Ising model and coupled phase oscillators. A key advantage of EP is that it achieves gradient descent on a cost function using the physics of the system to extract the weight gradients, making it a candidate for the development of energy-efficient processors for machine learning. We extend EP to quantum systems, where the energy function that is minimized is the mean energy functional (expectation value of the Hamiltonian), whose minimum is the ground state of the Hamiltonian. As examples, we study the settings of the transverse-field Ising model and the quantum harmonic oscillator network -- quantum analogues of the Ising model and elastic network.</description>

      <title>Characterization and thermometry of dissapatively stabilized steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the properties of dissipatively stabilized steady states of noisy quantum algorithms, exploring the extent to which they can be well approximated as thermal distributions, and proposing methods to extract the effective temperature T. We study an algorithm called the Relaxational Quantum Eigensolver (RQE), which is one of a family of algorithms that attempt to find ground states and balance error in noisy quantum devices. In RQE, we weakly couple a second register of auxiliary "shadow" qubits to the primary system in Trotterized evolution, thus engineering an approximate zero-temperature bath by periodically resetting the auxiliary qubits during the algorithm's runtime. Balancing the infinite temperature bath of random gate error, RQE returns states with an average energy equal to a constant fraction of the ground state. We probe the steady states of this algorithm for a range of base error rates, using several methods for estimating both T and deviations from thermal behavior. In particular, we both confirm that the steady states of these systems are often well-approximated by thermal distributions, and show that the same resources used for cooling can be adopted for thermometry, yielding a fairly reliable measure of the temperature. These methods could be readily implemented in near-term quantum hardware, and for stabilizing and probing Hamiltonians where simulating approximate thermal states is hard for classical computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study diverse exceptional points (EPs) in an experimentally feasible magno-optomechanics consisting of an optomechanical subsystem coupled to a magnomechanical subsystem via physically direct contact. By adiabatically eliminating both the cavity and the Kittel mode, dissipative and parity-time symmetric exceptional points can be observed. When only the cavity mode is eliminated, a second (third) -order pseudo-Hermitian EP emerges for nondegenerate (degenerate) mechanical modes. The distinct dynamical behavior of two mechanical modes around these EPs are further studied. Our proposal provides a promising way to engineer diverse EPs and quantify non-Hermitian phase transition with exceptional dynamical behavior in magno-optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing entangled two-photon absorption of Nile Red via temperature-controlled SPDC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled two-photon absorption can enable a linear scaling of fluorescence emission with the excitation power. In comparison to classical two-photon absorption with a quadratic scaling, this can allow fluorescence imaging or photolithography with high axial resolution at minimal exposure intensities. However, most experimental studies on two-photon absorption were not able to show an unambiguous proof of fluorescence emission driven by entangled photon pairs. On the other hand, existing theoretical models struggle to accurately predict the entangled-two-photon-absorption behavior of chemically complex dyes. In this paper, we introduce an approach to simulate entangled two-photon absorption in common fluorescence dyes considering their chemical properties. Our theoretical model allows a deeper understanding of experimental results and thus the occurrence of entangled two-photon absorption. In particular, we found a remarkable dependency of the absorption probability on the phase-matching temperature of the nonlinear material. Further, we compared results of our theoretical approach to experimental data for Nile Red.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states are crucial for the fundamental understanding of non-linear bosonic systems and simultaneously advanced applications in quantum technologies. In many bosonic experiments the important quantum non-Gaussian feature is the negativity of the Wigner function, a cornerstone for quantum computation with bosons. Unfortunately, the negativities present in complex quantum states are extremely vulnerable to the effects of decoherence, such as energy loss, noise and dephasing, caused by the coupling to the environment, which is an unavoidable part of any experimental implementation. An efficient way to mitigate its effects is by adapting quantum states into more resilient forms. We propose an optimal protection of superpositions of coherent states against a sequence of asymmetric thermal lossy channels by suitable squeezing operations.</description>

      <title>Application of ZX-calculus to Quantum Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01095v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to quantum architecture search by integrating the techniques of ZX-calculus with Genetic Programming (GP) to optimize the structure of parameterized quantum circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Recognizing the challenges in designing efficient quantum circuits for QML, we propose a GP framework that utilizes mutations defined via ZX-calculus, a graphical language that can simplify visualizing and working with quantum circuits. Our methodology focuses on evolving quantum circuits with the aim of enhancing their capability to approximate functions relevant in various machine learning tasks. We introduce several mutation operators inspired by the transformation rules of ZX-calculus and investigate their impact on the learning efficiency and accuracy of quantum circuits. The empirical analysis involves a comparative study where these mutations are applied to a diverse set of quantum regression problems, measuring performance metrics such as the percentage of valid circuits after the mutation, improvement of the objective, as well as circuit depth and width. Our results indicate that certain ZX-calculus-based mutations perform significantly better than others for Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) in all metrics considered. They suggest that ZX-diagram based QAS results in shallower circuits and more uniformly allocated gates than crude genetic optimization based on the circuit model.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Carleman linearization approach to the quantum simulation of classical fluids based on Grad's generalized hydrodynamics and compare it to previous investigations based on lattice Boltzmann and Navier-Stokes formulations. We show that the Carleman-Grad procedure exhibits intermediate properties between the two. Namely, convergence of the Carleman iteration over a few tens of timesteps and a potentially viable quantum circuit implementation using quantum linear algebra solvers. However, both features still need substantial improvements to yield a viable quantum algorithm for fluid flows.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random number generation (QRNG) is a resource that is a necessity in the field of cryptography. However, its certification has been challenging. In this article, we certify randomness with the aid of quantum entanglement in a device independent setting, where we choose two-photon interference for source characterisation. The CHSH inequality violation and quantum state tomography are used as independent checks on the measurement devices. These measures ensure the unpredictability of quantum random number generation. This work can be easily extended to faster randomness expansion protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern quantum optical systems such as photonic quantum computers and quantum imaging devices require great precision in their designs and implementations in the hope to realistically exploit entanglement and reach a real quantum advantage. The theoretical and experimental explorations and validations of these systems are greatly dependent on the precision of our classical simulations. However, as Hilbert spaces increases, traditional computational methods used to design and optimize these systems encounter hard limitations due to the quantum curse of dimensionally. To address this challenge, we propose an approach based on neural and tensor networks to approximate the exact unitary evolution of closed entangled systems in a precise, efficient and quantum consistent manner. By training the networks with a reasonably small number of examples of quantum dynamics, we enable efficient parameter estimation in larger Hilbert spaces, offering an interesting solution for a great deal of quantum metrology problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, neutral atoms have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, offering scalability. In this study, we showcase the realization of atomic qubits in atom-molecular Bose-Einstein condensate, belonging to three distinct classes. In the first case, the condensed molecules form a droplet platform with a flat-top configuration, facilitating effective isolation from both external environments and neighbouring molecules. The second atomic qubits have wavefunctions in the ``pulse" form, exhibiting power law behaviour, whereas the third one has ground and excited state wavefunctions in their respective composite forms, $\sech^2{\beta x}$ and $\sech{\beta x}\tanh{\beta x}$. The localization of the qubits depends on the chemical potential, which is governed by the photo association, providing effective control for qubit manipulation. The relevant parameters, such as energy level separation, healing length, and atom numbers, are found to be influenced by the non-linearity and strength of photo associations governing the behaviour of macroscopic qubits and molecular droplets.</description>

      <title>Q-BiC: A biocompatible integrated chip for in vitro and in vivo spin-based quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable spin-based quantum sensors enable nanoscale measurements of temperature, magnetic field, pH, and other physical properties of a system. Advancing the sensors beyond proof-of-principle demonstrations in living cells and multicellular organisms towards reliable, damage-free quantum sensing poses three distinct technical challenges. First, spin-based quantum sensing requires optical accessibility and microwave delivery. Second, any microelectronics must be biocompatible and designed for imaging living specimens. Third, efficient microwave delivery and temperature control are essential to reduce unwanted heating and to maintain an optimal biological environment. Here, we present the Quantum Biosensing Chip (Q-BiC), which facilitates microfluidic-compatible microwave delivery and includes on-chip temperature control. We demonstrate the use of Q-BiC in conjunction with nanodiamonds containing nitrogen vacancy centers to perform optically detected magnetic resonance in living systems. We quantify the biocompatibility of microwave excitation required for optically detected magnetic resonance both in vitro in HeLa cells and in vivo in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for temperature measurements and determine the microwave-exposure range allowed before detrimental effects are observed. In addition, we show that nanoscale quantum thermometry can be performed in immobilised but non-anaesthetised adult nematodes with minimal stress. These results enable the use of spin-based quantum sensors without damaging the biological system under study, facilitating the investigation of the local thermodynamic and viscoelastic properties of intracellular processes.</description>

      <title>Statistics-Informed Parameterized Quantum Circuit via Maximum Entropy Principle for Data Science and Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has demonstrated significant potential in solving practical problems, particularly in statistics-focused areas such as data science and finance. However, challenges remain in preparing and learning statistical models on a quantum processor due to issues with trainability and interpretability. In this letter, we utilize the maximum entropy principle to design a statistics-informed parameterized quantum circuit (SI-PQC) that efficiently prepares and trains quantum computational statistical models, including arbitrary distributions and their weighted mixtures. The SI-PQC features a static structure with trainable parameters, enabling in-depth optimized circuit compilation, exponential reductions in resource and time consumption, and improved trainability and interpretability for learning quantum states and classical model parameters simultaneously. As an efficient subroutine for preparing and learning in various quantum algorithms, the SI-PQC addresses the input bottleneck and facilitates the injection of prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Quantum machines based on $\mathrm{Cu}_{3}$-like compounds using the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model in a triangular ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a theoretical investigation into an antiferromagnetically coupled spin system, specifically $\text{Cu}_{3}-\text{X}(\text{X=As, Sb})$, which exhibits a configuration of a slightly distorted equilateral triangle, as identified in previous literature. This system is modeled using the Heisenberg model within a triangular structure, incorporating exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, g-factors, and an external magnetic field. We explore three quantum machines based on the $\text{Cu}_{3}$-like antiferromagnetically coupled spin system. The magnetocaloric effect (MCE), which is notably more significant at low temperatures, around $T\sim1$K, for a perpendicular magnetic field at approximately $\sim5$T, has been analyzed. We examine the Carnot machine, observing the influence of the external magnetic field on its operation as both a heat engine and refrigerator, and discuss the thermal efficiencies under these conditions. Our findings suggest that enhanced MCE allows for broader operation regions as a heat engine. Additionally, we explore the quantum Otto machine, showing its versatility in functioning as a heat engine, refrigerator, heater, and thermal accelerator. However, it mainly operates as a refrigerator and accelerator. We also explore their corresponding thermal efficiencies. Similarly, we have analyzed the quantum Stirling machine, which is capable of functioning as a heat engine, refrigerator, heater, and thermal accelerator, but it mainly operates as a refrigerator and thermal accelerator. We also examined the corresponding thermal efficiencies. It is worth mentioning that the Otto machine performance as a heat engine is notably influenced by the MCE, while the operational mode of the Stirling machine switches between a heat engine and accelerator around MCE is more prominent.</description>

      <title>Realization of permutation groups by quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we exclusively utilize CNOT gates for implementing permutation groups generated by more than two elements. In Lemma 1, we recall that three CNOT gates are both necessary and sufficient to execute a two-qubit swap gate operation. Subsequently, in Lemma 2, we show that the maximum number of CNOT gates needed to carry out an n-qubit substitution operation is 3(n-1). Moving forward, our analysis in Section 3 reveals that utilizing five or fewer CNOT gates is insufficient for implementing a three-qubit swap gate corresponding to the permutation element (123). Hence six CNOT gates are both necessary and sufficient for implementing (123). This is done by employing a graph-theoretic approach to rigorously validate the results in terms of at most five CNOT gates. Using computational tools, we exhaustively explore all valid circuit diagrams containing exactly six CNOT gates to successfully execute the swap gate for (123), by explaining the equivalence classes in Remark 6 and Table 2. We conclude them in Theorem 7.To extend our analysis to the multiqubit scenario, we present the reducible and irreducible permutation elements in Definition 8. We clarify the equivalence between rows in the multi-qubit space and provide an approximate upper bound for multi-qubits to perform the aforementioned operations in Theorem 9. The comprehensive exploration of this paper aims to pave the way for further advancements in understanding quantum circuit optimization via multiple use of a specific two-qubit gate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many evidences appear in the past decades and show that the negativity of Casimir energy is responsible for exotic mechanical and gravitational effects. We study in this work the Lorentz boost of a Casimir cavity, on which little attention is paid to its momentum in historical works. We find that the vacuum energy and momentum carried by the cavity transform differently from those of point particles due to the cavity's extension feature. However, the mass-shell condition of the two are identical as long as the cavity is finite along the moving direction only.</description>

      <title>Theory of Eigenstate Thermalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If we prepare an isolated, interacting quantum system in an eigenstate and perturb a local observable at an initial time, its expectation value will relax towards a thermal expectation value, even though the time evolution of the system is deterministic. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) of Deutsch and Srednicki suggests that this is possible because each eigenstate of the full quantum system acts as a thermal bath to its subsystems, such that the reduced density matrices of the subsystems resemble thermal density matrices. Here, we use the observation that the eigenvalue distribution of interacting quantum systems is a Gaussian under very general circumstances, and Dyson Brownian motion random matrix theory, to derive the ETH and thereby elevate it from hypothesis to theory. Our analysis provides a derivation of statistical mechanics which neither requires the concepts of ergodicity or typicality, nor that of entropy. Thermodynamic equilibrium follows solely from the applicability of quantum mechanics to large systems and the absence of integrability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement plays an indispensable role in numerous quantum information and quantum computation tasks, underscoring the need for efficiently verifying entangled states. In recent years, quantum state verification has received increasing attention, yet the challenge of addressing noise effects in implementing this approach remains unsolved. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the performance of quantum state verification protocols in the presence of measurement noise. Based on the analysis, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided to uniquely identify the target state under noisy measurements. Moreover, we propose a symmetric hypothesis testing verification algorithm with noisy measurements. Subsequently, using a noisy nonadaptive verification strategy of GHZ and stabilizer states, the noise effects on the verification efficiency are illustrated. From both analytical and numerical perspectives, we demonstrate that the noisy verification protocol exhibits a negative quadratic relationship between the sample complexity and the infidelity. Our method can be easily applied to real experimental settings, thereby demonstrating its promising prospects.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of External and Internal Dynamics in Driven Two-level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a laser driven two-level system including quantized external degrees of freedom for each state can be decoupled into a set of oscillator equations acting only on the external degrees of freedom with operator valued damping representing the detuning. We give a way of characterizing the solvability of this family of problems by appealing to a classical oscillator with time-dependent damping. As a consequence of this classification we (a) obtain analytic and representation-free expressions for Rabi oscillations including external degrees of freedom with and without an external linear potential, (b) show that whenever the detuning operator can be diagonalized (analytically or numerically) the problem decomposes into a set of classical equations and (c) we can use the oscillator equations as a perturbative basis to describe Rabi oscillations in weak but otherwise arbitrary external potentials. Moreover, chirping of the driving fields phase emerges naturally as a means of compensating the Ehrenfest/mean-value part of the detuning operator's dynamics while the presence of driving phase noise leads to a stochastic evolution equation of Langevin type. Lastly, our approach is representation free with respect to the external degrees of freedom and as consequence a suitable representation or basis expansion can be chosen a posteriori depending on the desired application at hand.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the efficiency of quantum measurement-based engines with entangling measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of entangling measurements on the efficiency of quantum measurement- based engines. We first show that for engines comprising many subsystems their efficiency can be enhanced by performing entangling measurements, as opposed to local measurements over each subsystem. When the collective measurement produces the same local state for the subsystems as individual local measurements, the improvement in the efficiency is proportional to the amount of correlations. Finally, we show that for two level systems these type of engine can operate at perfect efficiency while yielding a finite amount of work, in the limit large the number of subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice models or structures are geometrical objects with mathematical forms, that are used to represent physical systems. They have been used widely in diverse fields, namely, in condensed matter physics, to study degrees of freedom of molecules in chemistry and in studying polymer dynamics and protein structures to name a few. In this article we discuss an encoding methodology of lattice structures in computational basis states of qubits (as used in quantum computing algorithms). We demonstrate a specific use case of lattice models in protein structure prediction. We do not propose any quantum algorithm to solve the protein structure prediction problem, instead, we propose a generic encoding methodology of lattice structures.</description>

      <title>Coined Quantum Walk on a Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a discrete-time, coined quantum walk on a quantum network where the coherent superposition of walker-moves originates from the unitary interaction of the walker-coin with the qubit degrees of freedom in the quantum network. The walk dynamics leads to a growth of entanglement between the walker and the network on one hand, and on the other, between the network-qubits among themselves. The initial entanglement among the network qubits plays a crucial role in determining the asymptotic values of these entanglement measures and the quantum walk statistics. Specifically, the entanglement entropy of the walker-network state and the negativity of the quantum network-qubit state saturate to values increasing with the initial network-entanglement. The asymptotic time-averaged walker-position probability distribution shows increasing localization around the initial walker-position with higher initial network entanglement. A potential application of these results as a characterisation tool for quantum network properties is suggested.</description>

Abstract: We examine metrological scenarios where the parameter of interest is encoded onto a quantum state through the action of a noisy quantum gate and investigate the ultimate bound to precision by analyzing the behaviour of the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI). We focus on qubit gates and consider the possibility of employing successive applications of the gate. We go beyond the trivial case of unitary gates and characterize the robustness of the metrological procedure introducing noise in the performed quantum operation, looking at how this affects the QFI at different steps (gate applications). We model the dephasing and tilting noise affecting qubit rotations as classical fluctuations governed by a Von Mises-Fisher distribution. Compared to the noiseless case, in which the QFI grows quadratically with the number of steps, we observe a non monotonic behavior, and the appearance of a maximum in the QFI, which defines the ideal number of steps that should be performed in order to precisely characterize the action of the gate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically optimize broadband pulse shapes that maximize Hahn echo amplitudes. Pulses are parameterized as neural networks (NN), nonlinear amplitude limited Fourier series (FS), and discrete time series (DT). These are compared to an optimized choice of the conventional hyperbolic secant (HS) pulse shape. A power constraint is included, as are realistic shape distortions due to power amplifier nonlinearity and the transfer function of the microwave resonator. We find that the NN, FS, and DT parameterizations perform equivalently, offer improvements over the best HS pulses, and contain a large number of equivalent optimal solutions, implying the flexibility to include further constraints or optimization goals in future designs.</description>

      <title>Rise and Fall of Anderson Localization By Lattice Vibrations: A Time-Dependent Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate relationship between electrons and the crystal lattice is a linchpin in condensed matter, traditionally described by the Fr\"ohlich model encompassing the lowest-order lattice-electron coupling. Recently developed quantum acoustics emphasizing the wave nature of lattice vibrations has enabled the exploration of previously uncharted territories of electron-lattice interaction, not accessible with conventional tools such as perturbation theory. In this context, our agenda here is two-fold. First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fr\"ohlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning for designing materials with tailored electron-lattice properties.</description>

      <title>Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS) that involves a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and the 2D dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical and experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], with snapshots of the quantum system obtained from the different measurement configurations, and show that the information from the second basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid in quantum dipole arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict that the gapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid naturally emerges in a two-dimensional array of quantum dipoles. In particular, we demonstrate that the dipolar XY model$\unicode{x2014}$realized in both Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules$\unicode{x2014}$hosts a quantum spin liquid ground state on the kagome lattice. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations indicate that this spin liquid exhibits signatures of gapless, linearly-dispersing spinons, consistent with the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. We identify a route to adiabatic preparation via staggered on-site fields and demonstrate that this approach can prepare cold spin liquids within experimentally realistic time-scales. Finally, we propose a number of novel signatures of the Dirac spin liquid tailored to near-term quantum simulators, including termination-dependent edge modes and the Friedel response to a local perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the spatial degree of freedom of light modes to construct optical analogues of generalized quantum coherent states for Hermite- and Laguerre-Gauss modes. Our optical analogues preserve the statistical properties of their quantum counterparts, encoded in their amplitude and phase distributions. We explore three basic symmetries that provide generalized displaced, rotated, and squeezed coherent states. Given the substantial interest in squeezed states for probing matter, we believe that the optical analogues introduced here have significant implications for optical sensing. Specifically, the single-particle nature of our spatial modes makes them robust candidates for sensing photosensitive materials. Overall, our approach opens the door to optical metrology and sensing protocols that mimic those already existing in the quantum realm, and facilitates further exploration of the quantum state zoo through classical optical analogues.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Navier-Stokes solve on noisy quantum hardware via a hybrid quantum-classical scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation solvers are required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and upcoming quantum hardware presents noise in the computations, requiring algorithms that make modest use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust under resource restrictions. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Classical devices perform nonlinear computations, and quantum ones use variational algorithms to solve the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. A multigrid preconditioning approach helps avoid local minima. HTree, a tomography technique with linear complexity in qubit count, reduces the quantum state readout time. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Generation of Superflow in a Fermionic Ring through Phase Imprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamic generation of persistent current by phase imprinting fermionic atoms in a ring geometry. Mediated by the pairing interaction, the Fermi condensate dynamically acquires a quantized current by developing azimuthal phase slips, as well as density and pairing-order-parameter depletions. Resorting to the Bogolioubov-de Gennes formalism, we investigate the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized superfluid current throughout the phase-imprinting process. This enables a detailed analysis of the impact of interaction, as well as different initial pairing states, on the superflow formation. In particular, we show that, as the condensate is tuned toward the Bose-Einstein-condensate side of the Feshbach resonance, the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential, leading to smaller quantized current under the same imprinting parameters. Our results offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow in the phase-imprinting process, and are helpful for the ongoing experimental effort.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge fields provide a conceptual framework for the description of particles having spins. The theoretical importance of non-Abelian gauge fields motivates their experimental synthesis and explorations. Here, we demonstrate non-Abelian lattice gauge fields for photons. In the study of gauge fields, lattice models are essential for the understanding of their implications in extended systems. We utilize the platform of synthetic frequency dimensions, which enables the study of lattice physics in a scalable and programmable way. We observe Dirac cones at time-reversal-invariant momenta as well as the direction reversal of eigenstate trajectories associated with such Dirac cones. Both of them are unique signatures of non-Abelian gauge fields in our lattice system. Our results highlight the implications of non-Abelian gauge field in the study of topological physics and suggest opportunities for the control of photon spins and pseudospins.</description>

      <title>Collective modes of nanoparticles levitated in a cavity: mechanical mode combs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated nanoparticles are being investigated as ultrasensitive sensors of forces and accelerations, with applications ranging from fundamental physics phenomena such as dark matter or quantum gravity to real world applications. Quantum cooling in up to 2 motional modes was achieved recently, and attention is now turning to multimode and multiparticle regimes. We investigate here the spectral characteristics of collective motion of $\Ntot= 2-20 $ nanoparticle modes interacting via the optical light of a cavity. We find output spectra of collective motion typically exhibit two dominant generic features: a broad spectral feature, the collective bright mode (CBM) as expected; but we introduce also the mechanical mode comb (MC) a -- not previously studied -- spectral feature. We investigate numerically, and can also precisely reproduce all the intricate details of the MC spectra, including ponderomotive squeezing, with a simple closed-form expression. We show the mechanical comb can autonomously repair loss of teeth due to nanoparticle loss, a feature that may offer robustness to a levitated sensor of external forces.</description>

      <title>Volichenko-type metasymmetry of braided Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents different mathematical structures connected with the parastatistics of braided Majorana qubits and clarifies their role; in particular, mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras belong to a more general framework than the Volichenko algebras defined in 1990 by Leites-Serganova as metasymmetries which do not respect even/odd gradings and lead to mixed brackets interpolating ordinary commutators and anticommutators. In a previous paper braided $Z_2$-graded Majorana qubits were first-quantized within a graded Hopf algebra framework endowed with a braided tensor product. The resulting system admits truncations at roots of unity and realizes, for a given integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$, an interpolation between ordinary Majorana fermions (recovered at $s=2$) and bosons (recovered in the $s\rightarrow \infty$ limit); it implements a parastatistics where at most $s-1$ indistinguishable particles are accommodated in a multi-particle sector. The structures discussed in this work are: - the quantum group interpretation of the roots of unity truncations recovered from reps of the quantum superalgebra ${\cal U}_q({{osp}}(1|2))$; - the reconstruction, via suitable intertwining operators, of the braided tensor products as ordinary tensor products; - the introduction of mixed brackets for the braided creation/annihilation operators which define generalized Heisenberg-Lie algebras; - the $s\rightarrow \infty$ untruncated limit of the mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras producing parafermionic oscillators; - (meta)symmetries of ordinary differential equations given by matrix Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $0+1$ dimension induced by the braided creation/annihilation operators; - in the special case of a third root of unity truncation, a nonminimal realization of the intertwining operators defines the system as a ternary algebra.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum States in Variational Monte Carlo Method: A Brief Summary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, variational Monte Carlo method based on neural quantum states for spin systems is reviewed. Using a neural network as the wave function allows for a more generalized expression of various types of interactions, including highly non-local interactions, which are closely related to its non-linear activation functions. Additionally, neural networks can represent relatively complex wave functions with relatively small computational resources when dealing with higher-dimensional systems, which is undoubtedly a "flattening" advantage. In quantum-state tomography, the representation method of neural quantum states has already achieved significant results, hinting at its potential in handling larger-sized systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical heterodyne detection is a powerful technique for characterizing a wide range of physical excitations. Here, we use two types of optical heterodyne detection techniques (fundamental and parametric pumping) to microscopically characterize the high-frequency auto-oscillations of single and multiple nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). To validate the technique and demonstrate its robustness, we study SHNOs made from two different material stacks, NiFe/Pt and W/CoFeB/MgO, and investigate the influence of both the RF injection power and the laser power on the measurements, comparing the optical results to conventional electrical measurements. To demonstrate the key features of direct, non-invasive, submicron, spatial, and phase-resolved characterization of the SHNO magnetodynamics, we map out the auto-oscillation magnitude and phase of two phase-binarized SHNOs used in Ising Machines. This proof-of-concept platform establishes a strong foundation for further extensions, contributing to the ongoing development of crucial characterization techniques for emerging computing technologies based on spintronics devices</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. This is because the redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated in CG. Therefore, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariance, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. We point out that discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving algebraic equations of polarization vectors. We also discuss the procedure for mapping gauge fields to qubits, and then demonstrate the polynomial scaling of qubits and the complexity of time evolution. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization conditions and full transseries structures for ${\cal PT}$ symmetric anharmonic oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin analysis (EWKB) for a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics (QM) defined by the potential that $V_{\cal PT}(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^{2 K} (i x)^{\varepsilon}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R}_{&gt;0}$ and $K, \varepsilon \in {\mathbb N}$ to clarify its perturbative/non-perturbative structure. In our analysis, we mainly consider the massless cases, i.e., $\omega = 0$, and derive the exact quantization conditions (QCs) for arbitrary $(K,\varepsilon)$ including all perturbative/non-perturbative corrections. From the exact QCs, we clarify full transseries structure of the energy spectra with respect to the inverse energy level expansion, and then formulate the Gutzwiller trace formula, the spectral summation form, and the Euclidean path-integral. For the massive cases, i.e., $\omega &gt; 0$, we show the fact that, by requiring existence of solution of the exact QCs, the path of analytic continuation in EWKB is uniquely determined for a given $N = 2K + \varepsilon$, and in consequence the exact QCs, the energy spectra, and the three formulas are all perturbative. Similarities to Hermitian QMs and resurgence are also discussed as additional remarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) are a crucial tool in a wide array of fields, in particular for quantum communication, where time taggers performance can severely affect the quality of the entire application. Nowadays, FPGA-based TDCs present a viable alternative to ASIC ones, once the nonlinear behaviour due to the intrinsic nature of the device is properly mitigated. To compensate said nonlinearities, a calibration procedure is required, usually based on an interpolation methods. Here we present the design and the demonstration of a TDC that is FPGA-based and showing a residual jitter of 27 ps, that is scalable for multichannel operation. The application in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is discussed with a unique calibration method based on the exploitation of single-photon detection that does not require to stop the data acquisition or to use any interpolation methods, thus increasing accuracy and removing data loss. The calibration was tested in a relevant environment, investigating the device behaviour between 5{\deg}C and 80{\deg}C. Moreover, our design is capable of continuously streaming up to 12 Mevents/s for up to ~1 week without the TDC overflowing.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Floquet engineering in a sawtooth chain -- a minimal model hosting a nearly flat band endowed with nontrivial quantum geometry -- coupled to driven surface polaritons. In this paradigmatic flat band model, light-matter coupling to a flat band is enabled by quantum geometry despite the vanishing band velocity and band curvature. We show that light polarization and finite momentum transfer in polaritonic settings provide sufficient tunability to flatten or unflatten bands, with sometimes drastic band structure modifications beyond what is attainable with laser pulses in free space. Possible implications for light-driven phenomena in prototypical flat-band moir\'e or kagome materials are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Recently achieved chiral condensates open intriguing avenues for the study of the chiral properties induced by current-density interactions. An attempt to include these features in a spinor system is presented, which gives rise to a nonlinear, effective spin-orbit coupling that emerges from the differential orbital currents, along with constraints in the conserved quantities due to the linear coupling between spin components. Chirality pervades the resulting spectrum of stationary states and their dynamical stability, which are explored in plane waves, dark and bright solitons, and Josephson vortices. Our analytical and numerical results reveal the destabilizing role of polarization and Josephson currents, and support the existence of stable nonlinear states built of linear superpositions of plane waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg alkaline earth atoms are promising tools for quantum simulation and metrology. When one of the two valence electrons is promoted to long-lived circular states, the second valence electron can be optically manipulated without significant autoionization. We harness this feature to demonstrate laser slowing of a thermal atomic beam of circular strontium atoms. By driving the main ion core 422 nm wavelength resonance, we observe a velocity reduction of 50 m/s without significant autoionization. We also show that a superposition of circular states undergoes very weak decoherence during the cooling process, up to the scattering of more than thousand photons. This robustness opens new perspectives for quantum simulations over long timescales with circular atoms, while simultaneously cooling their motional state. It makes it possible to mitigate the harmful effects of unavoidable heating due to spin-motion coupling during a quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in the PXP Model under Continuous Quasiperiodic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments realizing long-lived non-equilibrium states in aperiodically driven quantum many-body systems, we investigate the dynamics of a quasiperiodically driven Rydberg atom chain in the strong Rydberg blockage regime. In this regime, the system is kinetically constrained and the `PXP' model describes its dynamics. Even without driving, the PXP model exhibits many-body scarring and resultant persistent oscillations for dynamics originating from the N\'{e}el-ordered initial state. We demonstrate that a rich array of dynamical behaviors emerge when the system is subjected to a continuous drive. In the high-frequency regime, the system exhibits revivals and oscillations for the N\'{e}el ordered initial state both for periodic and quasi-periodic drives. We trace the origin of this non-ergodicity to an effective PXP Hamiltonian for both of these driving protocols in this regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the behavior of the fidelity and the entanglement entropy is non-monotonic at low frequencies in the high-amplitude regime. This leads to several re-entrant scarring transitions both for both the N\'{e}el-ordered and the fully polarized initial state. Our results demonstrate that continuous quasi-periodic drive protocols can provide a promising route to realize prethermal phases of matter in kinetically constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear propagation of cylindrical vector beam through a non-degenerate four level atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase-induced susceptibilities for both components of the probe vector beam (PVB) within an atomic system. The atoms are prepared in a non-degenerate four-level configuration. The transitions are coupled by a $\pi$ polarized control field and two orthogonally polarized components of a PVB. We show that the linear susceptibility of the medium depends on the phase shift between the control field and PVB, characterizing loss or gain in the system. Additionally, the phase shift causes polarization rotation in the vector beams (VBs) as they propagate. We further study the effect of nonlinearity on the VB propagation through the medium for a couple of Rayleigh lengths. The self-focusing and defocusing phenomena are observed for radial, azimuthal, and spiral VBs. The special chain-like self-focusing and defocusing leads to the formation of consecutive smaller spot sizes with moderate gain. Therefore, the mechanism of control of susceptibility and self-focusing may hold promise for applications such as transitioning from an absorber to an amplifier, high-resolution microscopy, and optical trap systems.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and modeling of $^{171}$Yb Rydberg states for high-fidelity two-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multichannel quantum defect (MQDT) models for highly excited $^{174}$Yb and $^{171}$Yb Rydberg states with $L \leq 2$. The models are developed using a combination of existing literature data and new, high-precision laser and microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, and validated by detailed comparison with experimentally measured Stark shifts and magnetic moments. We then use these models to compute interaction potentials between two Yb atoms, and find excellent agreement with direct measurements in an optical tweezer array. From the computed interaction potential, we identify an anomalous F\"orster resonance that likely degraded the fidelity of previous entangling gates in $^{171}$Yb using $F=3/2$ Rydberg states. We then identify a more suitable $F=1/2$ state, and achieve a state-of-the-art controlled-Z gate fidelity of $\mathcal{F}=0.994(1)$, with the remaining error fully explained by known sources. This work establishes a solid foundation for the continued development quantum computing, simulation and entanglement-enhanced metrology with Yb neutral atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: Introducing a class of SU(2) invariant quantum unitary circuits generating chiral transport, we examine the role of broken space-reflection and time-reversal symmetries on spin transport properties. Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an improved scheme of a three-qubit Toffoli gate based on fine structure state changing three-body Stark-tuned Rydberg interaction. This scheme is a substantial improvement of our previous proposal [I.I.Beterov et al., Physical Review A 98, 042704 (2018)]. Due to the use of a different type of three-body F\"orster resonance we substantially simplified the scheme of laser excitation and phase dynamics of collective three-body states. This type of F\"orster resonance exists only in systems with more than two atoms, while the two-body resonance is absent. We reduced the sensitivity of the gate fidelity to fluctuations of external electric field and eliminated the necessity to use external magnetic field for fine tuning of the resonant electric field value, compared to the previous scheme of Toffoli gate based on Rydberg atoms. A gate fidelity of &gt;99% was demonstrated in the calculations.</description>

      <title>Classical Verification of Quantum Computations in Linear Time</title>

Abstract: In the quantum computation verification problem, a quantum server wants to convince a client that the output of evaluating a quantum circuit $C$ is some result that it claims. This problem is considered very important both theoretically and practically in quantum computation [arXiv:1709.06984], [arXiv:1704.04487], [arXiv:1209.0449]. The client is considered to be limited in computational power, and one desirable property is that the client can be completely classical, which leads to the classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) problem. In terms of the total time complexity, the fastest single-server CVQC protocol so far has complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|^3)$ where $|C|$ is the size of the circuit to be verified and $\kappa$ is the security parameter, given by Mahadev [arXiv:1804.01082].
  In this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|)$, which is significantly faster than existing protocols. Our protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model [arXiv:1008.0931] assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [arXiv:1804.00640], which are both extensively used assumptions in quantum cryptography. Along the way, we also give a new classical channel remote state preparation protocol for states in $\{|+_\theta\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\theta\pi/4}|1\rangle):\theta\in \{0,1\cdots 7\}\}$, another basic primitive in quantum cryptography. Our protocol allows for parallel verifiable preparation of $L$ independently random states in this form (up to a constant overall error and a possibly unbounded server-side simulator), and runs in only $O(poly(\kappa)L)$ time and constant rounds; for comparison, existing works (even for possibly simpler state families) all require very large or unestimated time and round complexities [arXiv:1904.06320][arXiv:1904.06303][arXiv:2201.13445][arXiv:2201.13430].</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a method for simulating quantum systems using electrical networks. Our approach leverages a generalized similarity transformation, which connects different Hamiltonians, enabling well-defined paths for quantum system simulation using classical circuits. By synthesizing interaction networks, we accurately simulate quantum systems of varying complexity, from $2-$state to $n-$state systems. Unlike quantum computers, classical approaches do not require stringent conditions, making them more accessible for practical implementation. Our reinterpretation of Born's rule in the context of electrical circuit simulations offers a perspective on quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions encompass a variety of phenomena that occur in quantum systems exhibiting several possible symmetries. Traditionally, these transitions are explored by continuously varying a control parameter that connects two different symmetry configurations. Here we propose an alternative approach where the control parameter undergoes abrupt and time-periodic jumps between only two values. This approach yields results surprisingly similar to those obtained by the traditional one and may prove experimentally useful in situations where accessing the control parameter is challenging.</description>

      <title>Manipulating fermionic mode entanglement in the presence of superselection rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superselection rules (SSRs), linked to the conservation of physical quantities such as parity or particle number, impose constraints on allowable physical operations in fermionic systems. This affects the amount of extractable mode entanglement possessed in a given state and its manipulation by the so-called entanglement-free operations. Here, we present a majorization-based algorithm for the mixed state transformations of bipartite mode entanglement, where the allowed operations (i.e., resource non-generating operations), that is, local operations and classical communication, are restricted by local SSRs. We then focus on the local parity SSR and investigate the possibility to relax the constraints imposed by it through a catalyst. In particular, we show that an ancillary mode system can catalyze the change in local parity. Finally, we discuss the application of our methodology to various problems in different fields. Accordingly, we propose that it may shed new light on the activation of orbital entanglement in chemical molecules and the manipulation of multipartite entanglement or quantum discord in distinguishable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger as a Quantum Programmer: Estimating Entanglement via Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying entanglement is an important task by which the resourcefulness of a quantum state can be measured. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm that tests for and quantifies the separability of a general bipartite state by using the quantum steering effect, the latter initially discovered by Schr\"odinger. Our separability test consists of a distributed quantum computation involving two parties: a computationally limited client, who prepares a purification of the state of interest, and a computationally unbounded server, who tries to steer the reduced systems to a probabilistic ensemble of pure product states. To design a practical algorithm, we replace the role of the server with a combination of parameterized unitary circuits and classical optimization techniques to perform the necessary computation. The result is a variational quantum steering algorithm (VQSA), a modified separability test that is implementable on quantum computers that are available today. We then simulate our VQSA on noisy quantum simulators and find favorable convergence properties on the examples tested. We also develop semidefinite programs, executable on classical computers, that benchmark the results obtained from our VQSA. Thus, our findings provide a meaningful connection between steering, entanglement, quantum algorithms, and quantum computational complexity theory. They also demonstrate the value of a parameterized mid-circuit measurement in a VQSA.</description>

Abstract: Resolving the locations and discriminating the spin states of individual trapped ions with high fidelity is critical for a large class of applications in quantum computing, simulation, and sensing. We report on a method for high-fidelity state discrimination in large two-dimensional (2D) crystals with over 100 trapped ions in a single trapping region, combining a hardware detector and an artificial neural network. A high-data-rate, spatially resolving, single-photon sensitive timestamping detector performs efficient single-shot detection of 2D crystals in a Penning trap, exhibiting rotation at about $25\,\mathrm{kHz}$. We then train an artificial neural network to process the fluorescence photon data in the rest frame of the rotating crystal in order to identify ion locations with a success rate of $~90\%$, accounting for substantial illumination inhomogeneity across the crystal. Finally, employing a time-binned state detection method, we arrive at an average spin-state detection fidelity of $94(2)\%$. This technique can be used to analyze spatial and temporal correlations in arrays of hundreds of trapped-ion qubits.</description>

Abstract: The kernel trick in supervised learning signifies transformations of an inner product by a feature map, which then restructures training data in a larger Hilbert space according to an endowed inner product. A quantum feature map corresponds to an instance with a Hilbert space of quantum states by fueling quantum resources to machine learning algorithms. In this work, we point out that the quantum state space is specific such that a measurement postulate characterizes an inner product and that manipulation of quantum states prepared from classical data cannot enhance the distinguishability of data points. We present a feature map for quantum data as a probabilistic manipulation of quantum states to improve supervised learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliable provision of entangled qubits is an essential precondition in a variety of schemes for distributed quantum computing. This is challenged by multiple nuisances, such as errors during the transmission over quantum links, but also due to degradation of the entanglement over time due to decoherence. The latter can be seen as a constraint on the latency of the quantum protocol, which brings the problem of quantum protocol design into the context of latency-reliability constraints. We address the problem through hybrid schemes that combine: (1) indirect transmission based on teleportation and distillation; (2) direct transmission, based on quantum error correction (QEC). The intuition is that, at present, the quantum hardware offers low fidelity, which demands distillation; on the other hand, low latency can be obtained by QEC techniques. It is shown that, in the proposed framework, the distillation protocol gives rise to asymmetries that can be exploited by asymmetric quantum error correcting code (QECC), which sets the basis for unique hybrid distillation and coding design. Our results show that ad-hoc asymmetric codes give, compared to conventional QEC, a performance boost and codeword size reduction both in a single link and in a quantum network scenario.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are successful algorithms for studying physical systems on quantum computers. Recently, they were extended to the measurement-based model of quantum computing, bringing resource graph states and their advantages into the realm of quantum simulation. In this work, we incorporate such ideas into traditional VQE circuits. This enables novel problem-informed designs and versatile implementations of many-body Hamiltonians. We showcase our approach on real superconducting quantum computers by performing VQE simulations of testbed systems including the perturbed planar code, Z2 lattice gauge theory, 1D quantum chromodynamics, and the LiH molecule.</description>

Abstract: A central challenge in the verification of quantum computers is benchmarking their performance as a whole and demonstrating their computational capabilities. In this work, we find a universal model of quantum computation, Bell sampling, that can be used for both of those tasks and thus provides an ideal stepping stone towards fault-tolerance. In Bell sampling, we measure two copies of a state prepared by a quantum circuit in the transversal Bell basis. We show that the Bell samples are classically intractable to produce and at the same time constitute what we call a circuit shadow: from the Bell samples we can efficiently extract information about the quantum circuit preparing the state, as well as diagnose circuit errors. In addition to known properties that can be efficiently extracted from Bell samples, we give several new and efficient protocols: an estimator of state fidelity, a test for the depth of the circuit and an algorithm to estimate a lower bound to the number of T gates in the circuit. With some additional measurements, our algorithm learns a full description of states prepared by circuits with low T-count.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an exciting emerging area, the accuracy of the loss function still needs to be improved by the number of available qubits. Here, we reformulate the QML problem such that the approximation error (representation power) does not depend on the number of qubits. We prove that a classical-to-quantum transfer learning architecture using a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) improves the representation and generalization (estimation error) capabilities of the VQC model. We derive analytical bounds for the approximation and estimation error. We show that the architecture of classical-to-quantum transfer learning leverages pre-trained classical generative AI models, making it easier to find the optimal parameters for the VQC in the training stage. To validate our theoretical analysis, we perform experiments on single-dot and double-dot binary classification tasks for charge stability diagrams in semiconductor quantum dots, where the related empirical results support our theoretical findings. Our analytical and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of classical-to-quantum transfer learning architecture in realistic tasks. This sets the stage for accelerating QML applications beyond the current limits of available qubits.</description>

Abstract: Free fermions are some of the best studied quantum systems. However, little is known about the complexity of learning free-fermion distributions. In this work we establish the hardness of this task in the particle number non-preserving case. In particular, we give an information theoretical hardness result for the general task of learning from expectation values and, in the more general case when the algorithm is given access to samples, we give a computational hardness result based on the LPN assumption for learning the probability density function.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear spin polarization plays a crucial role in quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In this work, we demonstrate a robust and efficient method for nuclear spin polarization with boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) using ground-state level anti-crossing (GSLAC). We show that GSLAC-assisted nuclear polarization can be achieved with significantly lower laser power than excited-state level anti-crossing, making the process experimentally more viable. Furthermore, we have demonstrated direct optical readout of nuclear spins for $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ in h-BN. Our findings suggest that GSLAC is a promising technique for the precise control and manipulation of nuclear spins in $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ defects in h-BN.</description>

      <title>Quantum Force Sensing by Digital Twinning of Atomic Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High sensitivity detection plays a vital role in science discoveries and technological applications. While intriguing methods utilizing collective many-body correlations and quantum entanglements have been developed in physics to enhance sensitivity, their practical implementation remains challenging due to rigorous technological requirements. Here, we propose an entirely data-driven approach that harnesses the capabilities of machine learning, to significantly augment weak-signal detection sensitivity. In an atomic force sensor, our method combines a digital replica of force-free data with anomaly detection technique, devoid of any prior knowledge about the physical system or assumptions regarding the sensing process. Our findings demonstrate a significant advancement in sensitivity, achieving an order of magnitude improvement over conventional protocols in detecting a weak force of approximately $10^{-25}~\mathrm{N}$. The resulting sensitivity reaches $1.7(4) \times 10^{-25}~\mathrm{N}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. Our machine learning-based signal processing approach does not rely on system-specific details or processed signals, rendering it highly applicable to sensing technologies across various domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Registers of trapped neutral atoms, excited to Rydberg states to induce strong long-distance interactions, are extensively studied for direct applications in quantum computing. Here, we present a novel $CC\Phi$ quantum phase gate protocol based on radio-frequency-induced F\"{o}rster resonant interactions in the array of highly excited $^{87}$Rb atoms. The extreme controllability of interactions provided by RF field application enables high-fidelity and robust gate performance for a wide range of parameters of the atomic system, as well as it significantly facilitates the experimental implementation of the gate protocol. Taking into account finite Rydberg states lifetimes and atomic position control imperfections, we achieve theoretical gate fidelities of up to $99.7 \%$ in a cryogenic environment, thus showing the protocol compatibility with modern quantum error correction techniques.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Scaling Advantage for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on a Classically Intractable Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate algorithm for solving optimization problems on quantum computers. However, the potential of QAOA to tackle classically intractable problems remains unclear. Here, we perform an extensive numerical investigation of QAOA on the low autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) problem, which is classically intractable even for moderately sized instances. We perform noiseless simulations with up to 40 qubits and observe that the runtime of QAOA with fixed parameters scales better than branch-and-bound solvers, which are the state-of-the-art exact solvers for LABS. The combination of QAOA with quantum minimum finding gives the best empirical scaling of any algorithm for the LABS problem. We demonstrate experimental progress in executing QAOA for the LABS problem using an algorithm-specific error detection scheme on Quantinuum trapped-ion processors. Our results provide evidence for the utility of QAOA as an algorithmic component that enables quantum speedups.</description>

Abstract: Color code is a promising topological code for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Insufficient research on the color code has delayed its practical application. In this work, we address several key issues to facilitate practical fault-tolerant quantum computing based on color codes. First, by introducing decoding graphs with error-rate-related weights, we obtained the threshold of $0.47\%$ of the 6,6,6 triangular color code under the standard circuit-level noise model, narrowing the gap to that of the surface code. Second, our work firstly investigates the circuit-level decoding of color code lattice surgery, and gives an efficient decoding algorithm, which is crucial for performing logical operations in a quantum computer with two-dimensional architectures. Lastly, a new state injection protocol of the triangular color code is proposed, reducing the output magic state error rate in one round of 15 to 1 distillation by two orders of magnitude compared to a previous rough protocol. We have also proven that our protocol offers the lowest logical error rates for state injection among all possible CSS codes.</description>

      <title>A solid-state platform for cooperative quantum dynamics driven by correlated emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While traditionally regarded as an obstacle to quantum coherence, recent breakthroughs in quantum optics have shown that the dissipative interaction of a qubit with its environment can be leveraged to protect quantum states and synthesize many-body entanglement. Inspired by this progress, here we set the stage for the -- yet uncharted -- exploration of analogous cooperative phenomena in hybrid solid-state platforms. We develop a comprehensive formalism for the quantum many-body dynamics of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects interacting dissipatively with the magnetic field fluctuations of a common solid-state reservoir. Our framework applies to any solid-state reservoir whose fluctuating spin, pseudospin, or charge degrees of freedom generate magnetic fields. To understand whether correlations induced by dissipative processes can play a relevant role in a realistic experimental setup, we apply our model to a qubit array interacting via the spin fluctuations of a ferromagnetic bath. Our results show that the low-temperature collective relaxation rates of the qubit ensemble can display clear signatures of super- and subradiance, i.e., forms of cooperative dynamics traditionally achieved in atomic ensembles. We find that the solid-state analog of these cooperative phenomena is robust against spatial disorder in the qubit ensemble and thermal fluctuations of the magnetic reservoir, providing a route for their feasibility in near-term experiments. Our work lays the foundation for a multi-qubit approach to quantum sensing of solid-state systems and the direct generation of many-body entanglement in spin-defect ensembles. Furthermore, we discuss how the tunability of solid-state reservoirs opens up novel pathways for exploring cooperative phenomena in regimes beyond the reach of conventional quantum optics setups.</description>

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computation using the bit-flip repetition code in a biased noise channel where only the bit-flip error can occur. While several logic gates can potentially produce phase-flip errors even in such a channel, we propose bias-preserving implementation of $S$, $H$, $\mathrm{CZ}$, and $R_z$ gates. We demonstrate that our scheme improves the computational precision in several tasks such as the time evolution of quantum systems and variational quantum eigensolver.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping entanglement in quantum spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is essential for exploring novel quantum phenomena and evaluating noisy quantum circuits. In this Letter, we address the problem of whether mixed states generated from noisy quantum circuits can be efficiently represented by locally purified density operators (LPDOs). We present a mapping from LPDOs of $N$ qubits to projected entangled-pair states of size $2\times N$ and introduce a unified method for managing virtual and Kraus bonds, which is numerically validated by noisy random quantum circuits with depths up to $d=40$, using fidelity and entanglement entropy as accuracy measures. LPDO representation proves to be effective in describing mixed states in both quantum and classical regions but encounters significant challenges at the quantum-classical critical point, limiting its applicability to the quantum region exclusively. In contrast, the matrix product operator (MPO) successfully characterizes the entanglement trend throughout the simulation, while truncation in MPOs breaks the positivity condition required for a physical density matrix. This work advances our understanding of efficient mixed-state representation in open quantum systems and provides insights into the entanglement structure of noisy quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Poisson Geometric Formulation of Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Poisson geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics for finite dimensional mixed and pure states. Equivalently, we show that quantum mechanics can be understood in the language of classical mechanics. We review the symplectic structure of the Hilbert space and identify its canonical coordinates. We extend the geometric picture to the space of density matrices $D_N^+$. We find it is not symplectic but admits a linear $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ Poisson structure. We identify Casimir surfaces of $D_N^+$ and show that the space of pure states $P_N \equiv \mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ is one of its symplectic submanifolds which is an intersection of primitive Casimirs. We identify generic symplectic submanifolds of $D_N^+$ and calculate their dimensions. We find that $D_N^+$ is singularly foliated by the symplectic leaves of varying dimensions, also known as coadjoint orbits. We also find an ascending chain of Poisson submanifolds $D_N^M \subset D_N^{M+1}$ for $ 1 \leq M \leq N-1$. Each such Poisson submanifold $D_N^M$ is obtained by tracing out the $\mathbb{C}^M$ states from the bipartite system $\mathbb{C}^N \times \mathbb{C}^M$ and is an intersection of $N-M$ primitive Casimirs of $D_N^+$. Their Poisson structure is induced from the symplectic structure of the bipartite system. We also show their foliations. Finally, we study the positive semi-definite geometry of the symplectic submanifold $E_N^M$ consisting of the mixed states with maximum entropy in $D_N^M$.</description>

Abstract: In this research, we present a Python-based solution designed to simulate a one-dimensional quantum system that incorporates multiple Dirac $\delta -$% potentials. The primary aim of this research is to investigate the scattering problem within such a system. By developing this program, we can generate wave functions throughout the system and compute transmission and reflection amplitudes analytically and numerically for an infinite range of combinations involving potential strengths, potential separations, and the number of potential centers in the form of the Dirac $\delta -$functions. Furthermore, by modifying the code, we investigate the so-called "transmission resonances" which yields the energy of the quantum particles undergoing a perfect transmission. Subsequently, our research is extended by considering impurities in the system.</description>

      <title>Relations between Markovian and non-Markovian correlations in multitime quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the dynamics of open quantum systems, information may propagate in time through either the system or the environment, giving rise to Markovian and non-Markovian temporal correlations, respectively. However, despite their notable coexistence in most physical situations, it is not yet clear how these two quantities may limit the existence of one another. Here, we address this issue by deriving several inequalities relating the temporal correlations of general multi-time quantum processes. The dynamics are described by process tensors and the correlations are quantified by the mutual information between subsystems of their Choi states. First, we prove a set of upper bounds to the non-Markovianity of a process given the degree of Markovianity in each of its steps. This immediately implies a non-trivial maximum value for the non-Markovianity of any process, independently of its Markovianity. Finally, we obtain how the non-Markovianity limits the amount of total temporal correlations that could be present in a given process. These results show that, although any multi-time process must pay a price in total correlations to have a given amount of non-Markovianity, this price vanishes exponentially with the number of steps of the process, while the maximum non-Markovianity grows only linearly. This implies that even a highly non-Markovian process might be arbitrarily close to having maximum total correlations if it has a sufficiently large number of steps.</description>

      <title>Tripartite quantum Rabi model with trapped Rydberg ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a tripartite quantum Rabi model (TQRM) wherein a bosonic mode concurrently couples to two spin-$1/2$ particles through a spin-spin interaction, resulting in a spin-spin-boson coupling -- a departure from conventional quantum Rabi models featuring bipartite spin-boson couplings. The symmetries of the TQRM depend on the detuning parameter, representing the energy difference between the spin states. At zero detuning a parity symmetry renders the TQRM reducible to a quantum Rabi model. A subradiant to superradiant transition in the groundstate is predicted as the tripartite coupling strength increases. For non-zero detuning the total spin emerges as the sole conserved quantity in the TQRM. It is found that superradiance prevails in the groundstate as long as the tripartite coupling remains non-zero. We derive the Braak $\mathcal{G}$-function of the TQRM analytically, with which the eigenspectra are obtained. The TQRM can be realized in a viable trapped Rydberg ion quantum simulator, where the required tripartite couplings and single body interactions in the TQRM are naturally present. Our study opens opportunities to explore and create novel correlations and entanglement in the spin and motional degrees of freedoms with the TQRM.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Diffusion Model: A Fully Quantum-Mechanical Model for Generating Quantum State Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical diffusion models have shown superior generative results and have been applied to many problems. Exploring these models in the quantum domain can advance the field of quantum generative learning. In this paper, we introduce the Quantum Generative Diffusion Model (QGDM), a simple and elegant quantum counterpart of classical diffusion models.
  The core idea of QGDM is that any target quantum state can be transformed into a completely mixed state, which has the highest entropy and maximum uncertainty about the system, through a non-unitary forward process. Subsequently, a trainable backward process can be used to recover the target state from the completely mixed state. The design requirements for QGDM's backward process include ensuring non-unitarity while maintaining a low number of parameters. To achieve this, we introduce partial trace operations in the backward process to enforce non-unitary. Additionally, we control the number of trainable parameters by using a parameter-sharing strategy and incorporating temporal information as an input in the backward process. Furthermore, we introduce a resource-efficient version of QGDM, which reduces the number of auxiliary qubits while preserving impressive generative capabilities.
  Our proposed models exhibit better convergence performance than Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) because our models optimize a convex distance function using gradient descent. Comparative results with QGANs demonstrate the effectiveness of our models in generating both pure and mixed quantum states. Notably, our models achieve 53.03% higher fidelity in mixed-state generation tasks compared to QGANs. These results highlight the potential of the proposed models to tackle challenging quantum generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Tracing quantum correlations back to collective interferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility of explaining nonclassical correlations between two quantum systems in terms of quantum interferences between collective states of the two systems. We achieve this by mapping the relations between different measurement contexts in the product Hilbert space of a pair of two-level systems onto an analogous sequence of interferences between paths in a single-particle interferometer. The relations between different measurement outcomes are then traced to the distribution of probability currents in the interferometer, where paradoxical relations between the outcomes are identified with currents connecting two states that are orthogonal and should therefore exclude each other. We show that the relation between probability currents and correlations can be represented by continuous conditional (quasi)probability currents through the interferometer, given by weak values; the violation of the noncontextual assumption is expressed by negative conditional currents in some of the paths. Since negative conditional currents correspond to the assignment of negative conditional probabilities to measurements results in different measurement contexts, the necessity of such negative probability currents represents a failure of noncontextual local realism. Our results help to explain the meaning of nonlocal correlations in quantum mechanics, and support Feynman's claim that interference is the origin of all quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measurement-only dynamical phase transition of topological and boundary order in toric code and gauge-Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extensively study long-time dynamics and fate of topologically-ordered state in toric code model evolving through projective measurement-only circuit. The circuit is composed of several measurement operators corresponding to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a cylinder geometry with distinct upper and lower boundaries to classify stationary states after long-time measurement dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases emerge in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both Higgs and confined phases are separated from the deconfined phase by topological entanglement entropy. We numerically clarify that both Higgs and confined phases are characterized by a long-range order on the boundaries accompanying edge modes, and they shift with each other by a crossover reflecting properties in the bulk phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: In two recent papers Khrennikov uses what he calls Ozawa intersubjectivity theorem to claim that intersubjectivity is necessarily verified in quantum mechanics and to criticize QBism and more generally all interpretations that are perspectival. In agreement with two previous QBist papers, I explain here why Khrennikov proof is not valid but in contrast with one of these papers, I criticize the way intersubjectivity is dealt with in QBism.</description>

      <title>Generating Reservoir State Descriptions with Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computer measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain, and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the reservoirs, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights using random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.</description>

Abstract: We entangle two co-trapped atomic barium ion qubits by collecting single visible photons from each ion through in-vacuo 0.8 NA objectives, interfering them through an integrated fiber-beamsplitter and detecting them in coincidence. This projects the qubits into an entangled Bell state with an observed fidelity lower bound of F &gt; 94%. We also introduce an ytterbium ion for sympathetic cooling to remove the need for recooling interruptions and achieve a continuous entanglement rate of 250 1/s.</description>

      <title>Simple loss-tolerant protocol for GHZ-state distribution in a quantum network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in realizing networks that connect quantum devices. However, sharing entanglement between distant nodes by means of photons is a challenging process primary due to unavoidable losses in the linking channels. In this paper, we propose a simple loss-tolerant protocol for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state distribution. We analyze the distribution rate under feasible experimental conditions and demonstrate the advantages of rate-loss scaling with respect to direct transmission. Our protocol does not use quantum repeaters and is achievable with current quantum optics technology. The result has direct application to tasks such as conference key agreement or distributed sensing. Moreover, it reduces the requirements for implementing distributed quantum error correction codes such as the surface code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Informationally overcomplete measurements find important applications in quantum tomography and quantum state estimation. The most popular are maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for which trace relations between measurement operators are well known. In this paper, we introduce a more general class of informationally overcomplete POVMs that are generated by equiangular tight frames of arbitrary rank. This class provides a generalization of equiangular measurements to non-projective POVMs, which include rescaled mutually unbiased measurements and bases. We provide a method of their construction, analyze their symmetry properties, and provide examples for highly symmetric cases. In particular, we find a wide class of generalized equiangular measurements that are conical 2-designs, which allows us to derive the index of coincidence. Our results show benefits of considering a single informationally overcomplete measurement over informationally complete collections of POVMs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Asynchronous Protocols for Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement in quantum networks is typically approached under idealized assumptions such as perfect synchronization and centralized control, while classical communication is often neglected. However, these assumptions prove impractical in large-scale networks. In this paper, we present a pragmatic perspective by exploring two minimal asynchronous protocols: a parallel scheme generating entanglement independently at the link level, and a sequential scheme extending entanglement iteratively from one party to the other. Our analysis incorporates non-uniform repeater spacings and classical communications and accounts for quantum memory decoherence. We evaluate network performance using metrics such as entanglement bit rate, end-to-end fidelity, and secret key rate for entanglement-based quantum key distribution. Our findings suggest the sequential scheme's superiority due to comparable performance with the parallel scheme, coupled with simpler implementation. Additionally, we impose a cutoff strategy to improve performance by discarding attempts with prolonged memory idle time, effectively eliminating low-quality entanglement links. Finally, we apply our methods to the real-world topology of SURFnet and report the performance as a function of memory coherence time.</description>

      <title>Faster entanglement driven by quantum resonance in many-body kicked rotors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resonance in the paradigmatic kicked rotor system is a purely quantum effect that ignores the state of underlying classical chaos. In this work, it is shown that quantum resonance leads to superlinear entanglement production. In $N$-interacting kicked rotors set to be at quantum resonance, entanglement growth is super-linear until a crossover timescale $t^*$, beyond which growth slows down to a logarithmic form with superimposed oscillations. By mapping positional interaction to momentum space and analytically assessing the linear entropy, we unravel the mechanism driving these two distinct growth profiles. The analytical results agree with the numerical simulations performed for two- and three-interacting kicked rotors. The late time entanglement oscillation is sensitive to changes in scaled Planck's constant with a high quality factor suitable for high precision measurements. These results are amenable to an experimental realization on atom optics setup.</description>

Abstract: Decoders that provide an estimate of the probability of a logical failure conditioned on the error syndrome ("soft-output decoders") can reduce the overhead cost of fault-tolerant quantum memory and computation. In this work, we construct efficient soft-output decoders for the surface code derived from the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching and Union-Find decoders. We show that soft-output decoding can improve the performance of a "hierarchical code," a concatenated scheme in which the inner code is the surface code, and the outer code is a high-rate quantum low-density parity-check code. Alternatively, the soft-output decoding can improve the reliability of fault-tolerant circuit sampling by flagging those runs that should be discarded because the probability of a logical error is intolerably large.</description>

      <title>A quantum spectrometer using a pair of phase-controlled spatial light modulators for superresolution in quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superresolution is a unique quantum feature generated by N00N states or phase-controlled coherent photons via projection measurements in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Superresolution has no direct relation with supersensitivity in quantum sensing and has a potential application for the precision measurement of an unknown signal frequency. Recently, phase-controlled quantum erasers have been demonstrated for superresolution using classical light of a continuous-wave laser to overcome the diffraction limit in classical physics and to solve the limited scalability in N00N state-based quantum sensing. Here, a quantum spectrometer is presented for the macroscopic superresolution using phase-controlled spatial light modulators (SLMs) in MZI. For validity, a general solution of the superresolution is derived from the SLM-based projection measurements and an unprecedented resolution is numerically confirmed for an unknown frequency of light.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-swapping in generalised probabilistic theories, and iterated CHSH games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there exist theories that have states "more strongly entangled" than quantum theory, in the sense that they show CHSH values above Tsirelson's bound, all known examples of such theories have a strictly smaller set of measurements. Therefore, in tasks which require both bipartite states and measurements, they do not perform better than QM. One of the simplest information processing tasks involving both bipartite states and measurements is that of entanglement swapping. In this paper, we study entanglement swapping in generalised probabilistic theories (GPTs). In particular, we introduce the iterated CHSH game, which measures the power of a GPT to preserve non-classical correlations, in terms of the largest CHSH value obtainable after $n$ rounds of entanglement swapping. Our main result is the construction of a GPT that achieves a CHSH value of $4$ after an arbitrary number of rounds. This addresses a question about the optimality of quantum theory for such games recently raised in the literature. One challenge faced when treating this problem is that there seems to be no general framework for constructing GPTs in which entanglement swapping is a well-defined operation. Therefore, we introduce an algorithmic construction that turns a bipartite GPT into a multipartite GPT that supports entanglement swapping, if consistently possible.</description>

Abstract: We apply the quantum error detection scheme Pauli check sandwiching (PCS) to quantum networks by turning it into a distributed multiparty protocol. PCS is a distance 1 code and requires less resource overhead than standard quantum error correction and detection methods. We provide analytical equations for the final fidelity and postselection rate. We also introduce a recursive version of PCS for entanglement purification that only scales polynomially in the resources required as a function of the number of recursions. The recursive PCS scheme generates a family of distance 2 quantum codes. Our analytical results are benchmarked against BBPSSW in comparable scenarios. We also perform simulations with noisy gates for entanglement swapping and attain substantial fidelity improvements. Lastly, we discuss various setups and graph state properties of PCS.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Layout Synthesis (QLS) plays a crucial role in optimizing quantum circuit execution on physical quantum devices. As we enter the era where quantum computers have hundreds of qubits, we are faced with scalability issues using optimal approaches and degrading heuristic methods' performance due to the lack of global optimization. To this end, we introduce a hybrid design that obtains the much improved solution for the heuristic method utilizing the multilevel framework, which is an effective methodology to solve large-scale problems in VLSI design. In this paper, we present ML-QLS, the first multilevel quantum layout tool with a scalable refinement operation integrated with novel cost functions and clustering strategies. Our clustering provides valuable insights into generating a proper problem approximation for quantum circuits and devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that ML-QLS can scale up to problems involving hundreds of qubits and achieve a remarkable 52% performance improvement over leading heuristic QLS tools for large circuits, which underscores the effectiveness of multilevel frameworks in quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the realization of controlled quantum systems, exploring excitations beyond the resonant case opens new possibilities. We investigate an extended Jaynes-Cummings model where two photon modes are coupled off-resonantly to a quantum emitter. This allows us to identify few-photon scattering mechanisms that lead to a full inversion of the emitter while transferring off-resonant photons from one mode to another. This behaviour connects to recent measurements of a two-level emitter scattering two off-resonant photons simultaneously. Furthermore, our results can be understood as quantized analogue of the recently developed off-resonant quantum control scheme known as Swing-UP of quantum EmitteR (SUPER). Our intuitive formalism gives a deeper insight into the interaction of a two-level emitter with off-resonant light modes with the prospect of novel photonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.06067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The square root of Not is a logical operator of importance in quantum computing theory and of interest as a mathematical object in its own right. In physics, it is a square complex matrix of dimension 2. In the present work it is a complex square matrix of arbitrary dimension. The introduction of linear algebra into logical theory has been enhanced in recent decades by the researches in the field of neural networks and quantum computing. Here we will make a brief description of the representation of logical operations through matrices and we show how general expressions for the two square roots of the Not operator are obtained. Then, we explore two topics. First, we study an extension to a non-quantum domain of a short form of Deutsch's algorithm. Then, we assume that a root of Not is a matrix extension of the imaginary unit i, and under this idea we obtain fully matrix versions for the Euler expansions and for the representations of circular functions by complex exponentials.</description>

      <title>Partial Degeneration of Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensors are often studied by introducing preorders such as restriction and degeneration: the former describes transformations of the tensors by local linear maps on its tensor factors; the latter describes transformations where the local linear maps may vary along a curve, and the resulting tensor is expressed as a limit along this curve. In this work we introduce and study partial degeneration, a special version of degeneration where one of the local linear maps is constant whereas the others vary along a curve. Motivated by algebraic complexity, quantum entanglement and tensor networks, we present constructions based on matrix multiplication tensors and find examples by making a connection to the theory of prehomogeneous tensor spaces. We highlight the subtleties of this new notion by showing obstruction and classification results for the unit tensor. To this end, we study the notion of aided rank, a natural generalization of tensor rank. The existence of partial degenerations gives strong upper bounds on the aided rank of a tensor, which allows one to turn degenerations into restrictions. In particular, we present several examples, based on the W-tensor and the Coppersmith-Winograd tensors, where lower bounds on aided rank provide obstructions to the existence of certain partial degenerations.</description>

Abstract: The quest to identify and observe Majorana fermions in physics and condensed-matter systems remains an important challenge. Here, we introduce a qubit (spin-$1/2$) from the occurrence of two delocalized zero-energy Majorana fermions in a model of two spins-$1/2$ on the Bloch sphere within the fractional one-half topological state. We address specific protocols in time with circularly polarized light and the protection of this delocalized spin-$1/2$ state related to quantum information protocols. We also show how disorder can play a positive and important role allowing singlet-triplet transitions and resulting in an additional elongated region for the fractional phase, demonstrating the potential of this platform related to applications in topologically protected quantum information. We generalize our approach with an array and Majorana fermions at the edges in a ring geometry.</description>

      <title>Microwave-multiplexed qubit controller using adiabatic superconductor logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic qubit controllers (QCs) are the key to build large-scale superconducting quantum processors. However, developing scalable QCs is challenging because the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is too small (~10 $\mu$W at ~10 mK) to operate conventional logic families, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic and superconducting single-flux-quantum logic, near qubits. Here we report on a scalable QC using an ultra-low-power superconductor logic family, namely adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. The AQFP-based QC, referred to as the AQFP-multiplexed QC (AQFP-mux QC), produces multi-tone microwave signals for qubit control with an extremely small power dissipation of 81.8 pW per qubit. Furthermore, the AQFP-mux QC adopts microwave multiplexing to reduce the number of coaxial cables for operating the entire system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an AQFP-mux QC chip that produces microwave signals at two output ports through microwave multiplexing and demultiplexing. Experimental results show an output power of approximately $-$80 dBm and on/off ratio of ~40 dB at each output port. Basic mixing operation is also demonstrated by observing sideband signals.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator and multifold bulk-edge correspondence"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comment on the recent paper ``Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator and multifold bulk-edge correspondence" by Tianyu Li and Haiping Hu, Nat. Comm. {\bf 14}, 6418 (2023). Apart from the fact that the authors unjustly imply to study multi-gap topology in Floquet systems for the first time, only known homotopic relations are presented. While such insights are used to present interesting Floquet phenomena and phases, which is an attractive result in itself, they cannot be used to deduce the total bulk characterization in the dynamical context without further proof. In fact, the authors essentially rephrase a Zak phase description. These results should in particular be contrasted to earlier results, arXiv:2208.12824, in which static-compatible Zak phases {\it and} dynamical Dirac strings were shown to be able to {\it distinguish} rather similar non-Abelian Floquet phases in $2+1$ dimensional systems. As a result, the claim of a sharp multifold bulk-edge correspondence cannot be concluded from the given arguments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transitions following a noisy quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to a noisy quench.</description>

      <title>Universal hard-edge statistics of non-Hermitian random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory is a powerful tool for understanding spectral correlations inherent in quantum chaotic systems. Despite diverse applications of non-Hermitian random matrix theory, the role of symmetry remains to be fully established. Here, we comprehensively investigate the impact of symmetry on the level statistics around the spectral origin -- hard-edge statistics -- and expand the classification of spectral statistics to encompass all the 38 symmetry classes of non-Hermitian random matrices. Within this classification, we discern 28 symmetry classes characterized by distinct hard-edge statistics from the level statistics in the bulk of spectra, which are further categorized into two groups, namely the Altland-Zirnbauer$_0$ classification and beyond. We introduce and elucidate quantitative measures capturing the universal hard-edge statistics for all the symmetry classes. Furthermore, through extensive numerical calculations, we study various open quantum systems in different symmetry classes, including quadratic and many-body Lindbladians, as well as non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We show that these systems manifest the same hard-edge statistics as random matrices and that their ensemble-average spectral distributions around the origin exhibit emergent symmetry conforming to the random-matrix behavior. Our results establish a comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian random matrix theory and are useful in detecting quantum chaos or its absence in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tuneable entangled photon pair generation in a liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid crystals, with their ability of self-assembly, strong response to the electric field, and integrability into complex systems, are key materials in light beam manipulation. Recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals also possess a considerable second-order optical nonlinearity, making them a perspective material for nonlinear optics. Their use as sources of quantum light could drastically extend the boundaries of photonic quantum technologies. However, spontaneous parametric down-conversion, the basic source of entangled photons, heralded single photons, and squeezed light, has been so far not observed in liquid crystals - or in any liquids or organic materials. Here, we implement spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal and demonstrate electric-field tunable broadband generation of entangled photons, with the efficiency comparable to that of the best nonlinear crystals. The emission rate and polarization state of photon pairs is dramatically varied by applying a few volts or twisting the molecular orientation along the sample. A liquid crystal source enables a new type of quasi-phasematching, which is based on molecular twist structure and is therefore reconfigurable for the desired spectral and polarization properties of photon pairs. Such sources promise to outperform standard nonlinear optical materials in terms of functionality, brightness and the tunability of the generated quantum state. The concepts developed here can be extended to complex topological structures, macroscopic devices, and multi-pixel tunable quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Numerical linked-cluster expansions for two-dimensional spin models with continuous disorder distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that numerical linked cluster expansions (NLCEs) based on sufficiently large building blocks allow one to obtain accurate low-temperature results for the thermodynamic properties of spin lattice models with continuous disorder distributions. Specifically, we show that such results can be obtained computing the disorder averages in the NLCE clusters before calculating their weights. We provide a proof of concept using three different NLCEs based on L, square, and rectangle building blocks. We consider both classical (Ising) and quantum (Heisenberg) spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models and show that convergence can be achieved down to temperatures that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the relevant energy scale in the model. Additionally, we provide evidence that in one dimension one can obtain accurate results for observables such as the energy down to their ground-state values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A canonical formalism for quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime is developed. This formalism enables a systematic investigation of photons in the Schwarzschild gravitational field, yielding novel results as well as refining previous results that were predicted by heuristic methods. The claim that "the gravitational redshift is a shift in the sharp frequencies of the photons for all frequencies of the spectrum" is proved. It is shown the gravitational decoherence is due to photon-gravity coupling and observer-dependent quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime phenomena. The proper value of the photon gravitational interferometric relative phase shift is calculated and its full quantum-general relativistic nature is demonstrated. It is shown its observation will falsify the validity of Newtonian gravity and the extension of the Einstein equivalence principle beyond a single point (even in the weak uniform gravitational field.)</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory and Application of Contextual Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has fueled machine learning (ML) across many domains. When paired data measurements $(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\nu})$ are coupled to covariates, a challenging conditional distribution learning setting arises. Existing approaches for learning a $\textit{global}$ transport map parameterized through a potentially unseen context utilize Neural OT and largely rely on Brenier's theorem. Here, we propose a first-of-its-kind quantum computing formulation for amortized optimization of contextualized transportation plans. We exploit a direct link between doubly stochastic matrices and unitary operators thus unravelling a natural connection between OT and quantum computation. We verify our method (QontOT) on synthetic and real data by predicting variations in cell type distributions conditioned on drug dosage. Importantly we conduct a 24-qubit hardware experiment on a task challenging for classical computers and report a performance that cannot be matched with our classical neural OT approach. In sum, this is a first step toward learning to predict contextualized transportation plans through quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>A single-photon large-momentum-transfer atom interferometry scheme for Sr or Yb atoms with application to determining the fine-structure constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading experimental determinations of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, currently rely on atomic photon-recoil measurements from Ramsey-Bord\'e atom interferometry with large momentum transfer to provide an absolute mass measurement. We propose an experimental scheme for an intermediate-scale differential atom interferometer to measure the photon-recoil of neutral atomic species with a single-photon optical clock transition. We calculate trajectories for our scheme that optimise the recoil phase while nullifying the undesired gravity-gradient phase by considering independently launching two clouds of ultracold atoms with the appropriate initial conditions. For Sr and Yb, we find an atom interferometer of height 3m to be sufficient for an absolute mass measurement precision of $\Delta m / m \sim 1\times 10^{-11}$ with current technology. Such a precise measurement (the first of its kind for Sr or Yb) would halve the uncertainty in $\alpha$ -- an uncertainty that would no longer be limited by an absolute mass measurement. The removal of this limitation would allow the uncertainty in $\alpha$ to be reduced by a factor of 10 by corresponding improvements in relative mass measurements, thus paving the way for higher-precision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bulk magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the computation of Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy (SREE) for boosted intervals in a two dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we compute the same in various non-Lorentzian limits, viz, Galilean and Carrollian Conformal Field Theory in same number of dimensions. We approach the problem both from a limiting perspective and by using intrinsic symmetries of respective non-Lorentzian conformal algebras. In particular, we calculate the leading order terms, logarithmic terms, and the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ terms and explicitly show exact compliance with $\textit{equipartition of entanglement}$, even in the non-Lorentzian system. Keeping in mind the holographic origin of SREE for the Carrollian limit, we further compute SREE for BMS$_{3}$-Kac-Moody, which couples a $U(1)\times U(1)$ theory with bulk gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum observables $H$ truncated on the range of orthogonal projections $\Pi_N$ of rank $N$, we study the corresponding Weyl symbol in the phase space in the semiclassical limit of vanishing Planck constant $\hbar\to0$ and large quantum number $N\to\infty$, with $\hbar N$ fixed. Under certain assumptions, we prove the $L^2$- convergence of the Weyl symbols to a symbol truncated (hence, in general discontinuous) on the classically allowed region in phase space. As an illustration of the general theorems we analyse truncated observables for the harmonic oscillator and for a free particle in a one-dimensional box. In the latter case, we also compute the microscopic pointwise limit of the symbols near the boundary of the classically allowed region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The creation of particles by the excitation of the quantum vacuum in a cavity with a moving mirror was predicted in 1969. Here, we investigate that, in addition to real particles, the excitation of the quantum vacuum in a dynamical cavity can also result in the creation of a certain amount of positive vacuum energy around these particles. We show that while in the case of a single mirror moving in a free space, with the field in the vacuum state, all the energy transferred from the mirror to the field is converted into real particles, on the other hand, when considering a second and static mirror forming a cavity with the first, the same movement of the first mirror can lead to less energy being converted into real particles, with the difference being converted into positive vacuum energy around these particles.</description>

      <title>Spread and Spectral Complexity in Quantum Spin Chains: from Integrability to Chaos</title>

Abstract: We explore spread and spectral complexity in quantum systems that exhibit a transition from integrability to chaos, namely the mixed-field Ising model and the next-to-nearest-neighbor deformation of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. We corroborate the observation that the presence of a peak in spread complexity before its saturation, is a characteristic feature in chaotic systems. We find that, in general, the saturation value of spread complexity post-peak depends not only on the spectral statistics of the Hamiltonian, but also on the specific state. However, there appears to be a maximal universal bound determined by the symmetries and dimension of the Hamiltonian, which is realized by the thermofield double state (TFD) at infinite temperature. We also find that the time scales at which the spread complexity and spectral form factor change their behaviour agree with each other and are independent of the chaotic properties of the systems. In the case of spectral complexity, we identify that the key factor determining its saturation value and timescale in chaotic systems is given by minimum energy difference in the theory's spectrum. This explains observations made in the literature regarding its earlier saturation in chaotic systems compared to their integrable counterparts. We conclude by discussing the properties of the TFD which, we conjecture, make it suitable for probing signatures of chaos in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to Chemically Accurate Quantum Computing via Density-based Basis-set Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises a computational advantage over classical methods in electronic-structure calculations, with expected applications in drug design and materials science. Accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources, such as the number of qubits, is an essential challenge given the limited capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards quantum computations at chemical accuracy by approaching the complete-basis-set limit (CBS) through integrating density-functional theory into quantum algorithms via density-based basis-set corrections coupled to basis-sets crafted on-the-fly and specifically adapted to a given system/user-defined qubit budget. The approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties such as dipole moments. It can also serve as a classical, a posteriori, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations. The strategy is assessed using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation up to 32 qubits. We converge the ground-state energies of four systems (He, Be, H$_2$, LiH) within chemical accuracy of the CBS full-configuration-interaction reference, while offering a systematic increase of accuracy beyond a double-zeta quality for various molecules up to the H$_8$ hydrogen chain. We also obtain dissociation curves for H$_2$ and LiH that reach the CBS limit whereas for the challenging simulation of the N$_2$ triple-bond breaking, we achieve a near-triple-zeta quality at the cost of a minimal basis-set. This hybrid strategy allows us to obtain quantitative results that would otherwise require brute-force quantum simulations using far more than 100 logical qubits, thereby opening up opportunities to explore real-world chemistry with reasonable computational resources.</description>
