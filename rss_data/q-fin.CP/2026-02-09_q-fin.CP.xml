      <title>Single- and Multi-Level Fourier-RQMC Methods for Multivariate Shortfall Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate shortfall risk measures provide a principled framework for quantifying systemic risk and determining capital allocations prior to aggregation in interconnected financial systems. Despite their well established theoretical properties, the numerical estimation of multivariate shortfall risk and the corresponding optimal allocations remains computationally challenging, as existing Monte Carlo based approaches can be numerically expensive due to slow convergence.
  In this work, we develop a new class of single and multilevel numerical algorithms for estimating multivariate shortfall risk and the associated optimal allocations, based on a combination of Fourier inversion techniques and randomized quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling. Rather than operating in physical space, our approach evaluates the relevant expectations appearing in the risk constraint and its optimization in the frequency domain, where the integrands exhibit enhanced smoothness properties that are well suited for RQMC integration. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework for the resulting Fourier RQMC estimators, including convergence analysis and computational complexity bounds. Beyond the single level method, we introduce a multilevel RQMC scheme that exploits the geometric convergence of the underlying deterministic optimization algorithm to reduce computational cost while preserving accuracy.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed Fourier RQMC methods outperform sample average approximation and stochastic optimization benchmarks in terms of accuracy and computational cost across a range of models for the risk factors and loss structures. Consistent with the theoretical analysis, these results demonstrate improved asymptotic convergence and complexity rates relative to the benchmark methods, with additional savings achieved through the proposed multilevel RQMC construction.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Noisy Real-World Corpora for Foundation Model Pre-Training via Quality-Aware Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.</description>

      <title>Fill Probabilities in a Limit Order Book with State-Dependent Stochastic Order Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the fill probabilities of limit orders placed at different price levels in a limit order book. These probabilities play a central role in execution optimization, as limit orders are not guaranteed to be executed and inherently involve a trade-off between execution cost and execution risk. We model the limit order book within a general state-dependent stochastic framework, representing its dynamics as a collection of interacting queuing systems while incorporating key stylized market features. Within this framework, we derive semi-analytical expressions for several quantities of interest under state-dependent order flows, including the probability of a mid-price change, the fill probabilities of orders placed at the best quotes, and those of orders placed deeper in the book before the opposite best quote moves. While the framework can be extended to even deeper price levels, the corresponding fill probabilities are typically negligible. We validate the proposed model through extensive numerical experiments using real foreign exchange spot market data. The results demonstrate that the model remains tractable while capturing essential order book dynamics, and that the derived expressions achieve good accuracy in estimating fill probabilities.</description>
