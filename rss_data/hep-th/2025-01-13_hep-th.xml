      <title>Casimir Effect of rough plates under a magnetic field in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect for parallel plates within the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in $3+1$ dimensions, considering the effects of roughness, anisotropic scaling factor, and an uniform constant magnetic field. Quantum fluctuations are induced by an anisotropic charged-scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. To incorporate surface roughness, we apply a coordinate transformation to flatten the plates, treating the remaining roughness terms as potential. The spectrum is derived using perturbation theory and regularized with the $\zeta$-function method. As an illustrative example, we consider plates with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric and gauge-invariant path integral measure in $\mathcal N=2$ SQCD in terms of $\mathcal N=1$ superfields. As a further consequence, we derive the $\mathcal N=2$ version of the chiral anomaly in a manifestly $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric way.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Features of Amplitudes in Planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar three-gluon form factor for the chiral stress tensor operator in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is an analog of the Higgs-to-three-gluon scattering amplitude in QCD. The amplitude (symbol) bootstrap program has provided a wealth of high-loop perturbative data about this form factor, with results up to eight loops available. The symbol of the form factor at $L$ loops is given by words of length $2L$ in six letters with associated integer coefficients. In this paper, we analyze this data, describing patterns of zero coefficients and relations between coefficients. We find many sequences of words whose coefficients are given by closed-form expressions which we expect to be valid at any loop order. Moreover, motivated by our previous machine-learning analysis, we identify simple recursion relations that relate the coefficient of a word to the coefficients of particular lower-loop words. These results open an exciting door for understanding scattering amplitudes at all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Conformal blocks from celestial graviton amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-point gluon and graviton correlators in celestial holography are famously non-analytic, having distributional support. In this work, we propose an alternative graviton correlator that is analytic and displays several desirable properties. We compute the four-point correlator involving one graviton shadow operator and three graviton primary operators from the celestial four-point graviton amplitudes at tree-level. We perform the conformal block decomposition for the shadow correlator in the compatible channel. For the case when the shadow operator is conformally soft, we compute the single-valued completion of the shadow correlator and perform the conformal block decomposition of the single-valued shadow correlator in all channels. We find an integral representation of the single-valued shadow correlator, which allows us to invert the shadow transform to find the single-valued celestial graviton amplitude. We study various properties of the single-valued celestial graviton amplitude. Interestingly, it exhibits a double copy structure in relation to its counterpart gluon amplitude.</description>

      <title>Classification of $T^2/Z_m$ orbifold boundary conditions in $SO(N)$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generally classify the equivalence classes of the $T^2/Z_m$ $(m=2,3,4,6)$ orbifold boundary conditions (BCs) for the $SO(N)$ gauge group. Higher-dimensional gauge theories are defined by gauge groups, matter field contents, and the BCs. The numerous patterns of the BCs are classified into the finite equivalence classes, each of which consists of the physically equivalent BCs. In this paper, we reconstruct the canonical forms of the BCs for the $SO(N)$ gauge group through the ``re-orthogonalization method." All the possible equivalent relations between the canonical forms are examined by using the trace conservation laws. The number of the equivalence classes in each orbifold model is obtained.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Teleportation in the cSYK/JT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two complex SYK models entangled in a thermofield double (TFD) state and investigate the effect of one-sided projective measurements. As measurement operator we choose single site charge operators. Performing a measurement results in a non-zero $U(1)$ charge. The entropy curve differs from the previously studied SYK model due to a thermodynamic phase transition that takes place after a certain charge is reached. We also match our results to a dual bulk description. Finally, a teleportation protocol is provided to support the notion of a traversable wormhole being formed.</description>

      <title>On spectator dependence of Jacobi-Lie T-plurality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently introduced Jacobi-Lie T-plurality turned out to be a solution-generating technique in string theory. Being based on Leibniz algebras instead of Drinfeld doubles, it can be understood as a generalization of Poisson-Lie T-plurality. In this paper we investigate Jacobi-Lie T-plurality with spectators, and focus particularly on modification of the spectator fields by an arbitrary function $f$. Using this modification new sigma model backgrounds can be constructed as Jacobi-Lie models. For low-dimensional Leibniz algebras classified a few years ago and warping factor $f(\omega)=\gamma\, e^{\omega}$ we find sigma model backgrounds satisfying Supergravity Equations and check that their plurals again satisfy Supergravity Equations.</description>

      <title>Massive dressing factors for mixed-flux AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow up on our proposal for dressing factors for the mixed-flux $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ background presented in arXiv:2402.11732. We discuss in detail the analytic properties of the dressing factors in the string and mirror kinematics for fundamental massive particles and bound states. We prove that the dressing factors are unitary and CP-invariant in the string kinematics, parity invariant in the mirror, and solve the crossing equations in both kinematics. In the limit of pure Ramond-Ramond flux they reduce to the known ones. Finally, we present their expansion at strong tension, as well as in the (small-RR-flux) relativistic limit, finding agreement with the literature.</description>

      <title>Black holes from chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of black hole geometry from chaotic systems at finite temperature. The essential input is the universal operator growth hypothesis, which dictates the asymptotic behavior of the Lanczos coefficients. Under this assumption, we map the chaotic dynamics to a discrete analog of the scattering problem on a black hole background. We give a simple prescription for computing the Green's functions, and explore some of the resulting analytic properties. In particular, assuming that the Lanczos coefficients are sufficiently smooth, we present evidence that the spectral density is a meromorphic function of frequency with no zeroes. Our formalism provides a framework for accurately computing the late time behavior of Green's functions in chaotic systems, and we work out several instructive examples.</description>

Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a bubble wall beyond the approximation of an infinitely thin wall. To this end, we discuss the proper decomposition into wall and bulk contributions, and we use a systematic method to calculate the energy-momentum tensor at any order in the wall width. We consider the specific examples of spherical bubbles with different initial configurations, and we compare our approximations with a numerical computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, under Dubrovin's notion of ''almost'' duality, the Frobenius manifold structure on the orbit spaces of the extended affine Weyl groups of type $\mathrm{ADE}$ is dual, for suitable choices of weight markings, to the equivariant quantum cohomology of the minimal resolution of the du Val singularity of the same Dynkin type. We also provide a uniform Lie-theoretic construction of Landau-Ginzburg mirrors for the quantum cohomology of $\mathrm{ADE}$ resolutions. The mirror B-model is described by a one-dimensional LG superpotential associated to the spectral curve of the $\widehat{\mathrm{ADE}}$ affine relativistic Toda chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-time and two-time correlators are computed exactly in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model after a quench to zero temperature and on a periodic chain of finite length $N$, using a simple analytical continuation technique. Besides the general confirmation of finite-size scaling in non-equilibrium dynamics, this allows to test the scaling behaviour of the plateau height $C_{\infty}^{(2)}$ to which the two-time auto-correlator converges, when deep into the finite-size regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lectures, we provide an introduction to the complex WKB method, using as a guiding example a class of anharmonic oscillators that appears in the ODE/IM correspondence. In the first three lectures, we introduce the main objects of the method, such as the WKB function, the integral equations of Volterra type, the quadratic differential and its horizontal/Stokes lines, the Stokes phenomenon, the notion of asymptotic values, the Fock-Goncharov coordinates and their WKB approximation. In the fourth and last lecture, we compute (and prove) the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillators in two asymptotic regimes, when the momentum is fixed and the energy is large, and when the momentum (hence also the energy) is large.</description>

Abstract: We will argue in this paper that the type classification of v.Neumann algebras play an important role in a theory of quantum gravity and quantum space-time physics. We provide arguments that type $II_{\infty}$ and its representation as a tensor product of an ordinary (exterior) Hilbert space algebra $\cB(\cH_I)$ and an (internal) type $II_1$ algebra, encoding, in our view, the hidden microscopic gravitational degrees of freedom, do represent the first step away from the semiclassical picture towards a full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Spectre of Underdetermination in Modern Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scientific status of physical cosmology has been the subject of philosophical debate ever since detailed mathematical models of the Universe emerged from Einstein's general theory of relativity. Such debates revolve around whether and to what extent cosmology meets established demarcation criteria for a discipline to be scientific, as well as determining how to best characterize cosmology as a science, given the unique challenges and limitations faced by a discipline which aims to study the origin, composition, and fate of the Universe itself. The present article revisits, in light of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier debate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow regarding the scientific status of cosmology. We analyse cosmology's transition from an emerging science to a cornerstone of modern physics, highlighting its empirical successes in establishing the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and in its delivery of various successful novel predictions. Despite this remarkable scientific success and progress, we argue that modern cosmology faces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the microphysical nature of its exotic energy components: inflation, dark matter, and dark energy. Drawing historical parallels with the role of spectroscopy in revealing the microphysical nature of atomic physics, we argue that the epistemic barriers obstructing us from ascertaining the microphysical nature of these exotic energy components are significant, in turn casting doubt upon whether cosmology can ever transcend these particular epistemic challenges. We conclude by reflecting on the prospects for future breakthroughs and/or non-empirical arguments which could decide this issue conclusively.</description>

      <title>Scattering with depletion in strong, focussed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical approaches to QED scattering in strong fields typically treat the field as a fixed background with simple spacetime dependence, such as a plane wave. Two major challenges are therefore the inclusion of effects due to backreaction (depletion of the field) and spatial geometry (e.g. focussing). We show here that a solution to one problem can solve the other: even if particle wavefunctions in a chosen focussed background are not known, we show that they can be constructed once depletion is accounted for. We demonstrate this by giving the exact wavefunctions in a depleting flying focus beam. We then calculate and analyse the amplitude of non-linear Compton scattering, comparing with the plane wave case. Our methods thus open a new avenue of investigation in which two previously challenging effects are simultaneously brought under analytic control.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solutions for $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems: generic statistical ensembles and a mesoscopic system application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of generic $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems are obtained through systematic manipulations of quartic polynomial equations. An {\em ansatz} for constructing separable and entangled eigenstate basis, depending on the quartic equation coefficients, is proposed. Besides the quantum concurrence for pure entangled states, the associated thermodynamic statistical ensembles, their partition function, quantum purity and quantum concurrence are shown to be straightforwardly obtained. Results are specialized to a $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ structure emulated by lattice-layer degrees of freedom of the Bernal stacked graphene, in a context that can be extended to several mesoscopic scale systems for which the onset from $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonians has been assumed.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum statistical mechanics of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In contrast, the quantum theory of many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. We relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum RP resonances converge inside the unit disk. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions. Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We identify the exact RP resonances in the RPM and prove that the same RP resonances are obtained from operator truncation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance. Finally, we demonstrate how conservation laws, many-body localization, and nonlocal interactions merge the leading RP resonance into the unit circle, thereby suppressing anomalous relaxation.</description>

      <title>Symplectic cuts and open/closed strings I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a concrete relation between genus zero closed Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds and genus zero open Gromov-Witten invariants of a Lagrangian $A$-brane in the same threefold. Symplectic cutting is a natural operation that decomposes a symplectic manifold $(X,\omega)$ with a Hamiltonian $U(1)$ action into two pieces glued along an invariant divisor. In this paper we study a quantum uplift of the cut construction defined in terms of equivariant gauged linear sigma models. The nexus between closed and open Gromov-Witten invariants is a quantum Lebesgue measure associated to a choice of cut, that we introduce and study. Integration of this measure recovers the equivariant quantum volume of the whole CY3, thereby encoding closed Gromov-Witten invariants. Conversely, the monodromies of the quantum measure around cycles in K\"ahler moduli space encode open Gromov-Witten invariants of a Lagrangian $A$-brane associated to the cut. Both in the closed and the open string sector we find a remarkable interplay between worldsheet instantons and semiclassical volumes regularized by equivariance. This leads to equivariant generating functions of GW invariants that extend smoothly across the entire moduli space, and which provide a unifying description of standard GW potentials. The latter are recovered in the non-equivariant limit in each of the different phases of the geometry.</description>

      <title>A Calabi-Yau-to-Curve Correspondence for Feynman Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been known that the maximal cut of the equal-mass four-loop banana integral is a period of a family of Calabi-Yau threefolds that depends on the kinematic variable $z=m^2/p^2$. We show that it can also be interpreted as a period of a family of genus-two curves. We do this by introducing a general Calabi-Yau-to-curve correspondence, which in this case locally relates the original period of the family of Calabi-Yau threefolds to a period of a family of genus-two curves that varies holomorphically with the kinematic variable $z$. In addition to working out the concrete details of this correspondence for the equal-mass four-loop banana integral, we outline when we expect a correspondence of this type to hold.</description>

Abstract: We construct TBA equations for D-type Argyres-Douglas theories with an SU(2) flavor symmetry based on their spectral networks. We show that the solutions of these TBA equations agree with the quantum periods of the corresponding quantum Seiberg-Witten curves defined in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the Omega background, including a centrifugal correction. We study the variety of TBA systems across the Coulomb branch moduli space and find that they correspond to the Dynkin diagrams of $D_n$ Lie algebras in the minimal chamber, and reproduce the TBA equations for reflectionless D scattering theories at the maximally symmetric point. Numerical computations demonstrate that the quantum periods obtained from the Borel-Pad\'e resummation and their WKB expansions are in agreement with the solutions of the TBA equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Not much is known about superstring scattering amplitudes in curved backgrounds. Using the hybrid formalism in $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3$ with pure NS-NS three-form flux, we compute a $\rm PSU(1,1|2)$-covariant three-point amplitude for half-BPS vertex operators inserted on the $\rm AdS_3$ boundary and show that it agrees with the RNS computation. The zero-mode prescription for the fermions in $\rm AdS$ is defined in terms of the ``standard'' spacetime SUSY generator. It is found that integrating out the fermionic worldsheet fields in the path integral gives rise to the target-space vielbein, which explicitly encodes that the conformal group on the boundary is identified with the symmetry group of the $\rm AdS$ bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Unruh effect within a general framework based on direct, probability-level calculations. We rederive the transition rate of a uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt monopole detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial (Minkowski) observer and an accelerating (Rindler) observer. We show that, for a measurement at a finite time after the initial state is prepared, the two perspectives give the same transition rate. We confirm that an inertial detector in a thermal bath of Minkowski particles responds differently to the accelerated detector (which perceives a thermal bath of Rindler particles), except in the case of a massless field where there is agreement at all times. Finally, new numerical results for the transition rate are presented and explained, highlighting the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Solving $\mathcal N=4$ SYM BCFT matrix models at large $N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many observables in 4d $\mathcal N=4$ SYM with Gaiotto-Witten boundary conditions can be described exactly by matrix models via supersymmetric localization. The boundaries typically introduce new degrees of freedom, through a reduction of the gauge symmetry on the boundary or as explicit boundary degrees of freedom, leading to non-trivial matrix models. We derive the saddle points dominating these matrix models at large $N$, expressed in terms of generalized Lambert W-functions. In string theory the BCFTs are realized by D3-branes ending on D5 and NS5 branes. We independently derive the saddle points from the holographic duals with $\rm AdS_4\times S^2\times S^2\times\Sigma$ geometry and provide precision tests of the dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near horizon geometries of D$p$-branes with $p\neq 3$ are singular with a running dilaton. Bound states of D$p$ branes with their magnetic cousins, D$(6-p)$ branes, can stabilise the dilaton such that an AdS factor might appear in the near horizon region, potentially leading to a chain of AdS vacua of the form $AdS_{p+2}\times S^{p+2} \times \mathbb{T}^{6-2p}$. The solutions with $p=-1, 1, 3$ are supersymmetric with the cases $p=1, 3$ being well-known examples already. We construct the explicit (partially smeared) brane bound state solutions for all such configurations where the cases $p=-1,2$ are entirely novel and we find no AdS geometry for these. The two novel classes of solutions feature ghost branes (negative tension branes), and we suggest they are physical for the D$(-1)-$D$7$ solutions but unphysical for the D$2-$D$4$ solutions. The bound state of a D$(-1)$ and a D7 brane in supergravity was only hinted upon recently in \cite{Aguilar-Gutierrez:2022kvk} and here we correct the solution in order to preserve supersymmetry and find that the dilaton can indeed be stabilised which indicates there could be a holographic dual matrix theory which generalises the IKKT matrix model to allow for conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Relations on Vertex Operator Algebras, II: Witt Equivalence and Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When can two strongly rational vertex operator algebras or 1+1d rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) be related by topological manipulations? For vertex operator algebras, the term "topological manipulations" refers to operations like passing to a conformal extension or restricting to a conformal subalgebra; for RCFTs, topological manipulations include operations like gauging (or orbifolding) a finite subpart of a generalized global symmetry or interpolating to a new theory via a topological line interface of finite quantum dimension.
  Inspired by results in the theory of even lattices and tensor categories, we say that two strongly rational vertex operator algebras are Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their modular tensor categories are Witt equivalent. Two RCFTs are said to be Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their associated 2+1d topological field theories can be separated by a topological surface. We argue that Witt equivalence is necessary for two theories to be related by topological manipulations. We conjecture that it is also sufficient, and give proofs in various special cases.
  We relate this circle of ideas to the problem of classifying RCFTs, and to lore concerning deformation classes of quantum field theories. We use the notion of Witt equivalence to argue, assuming the conjectural classification of unitary, $c=1$ RCFTs, that all of the finite symmetries of the $SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model are invertible. We also sketch a "quantum Galois theory" for chiral CFTs, which generalizes prior mathematical literature by incorporating non-invertible symmetries; we illustrate this non-invertible Galois theory in the context of the monster CFT, for which we produce two Fibonacci lines. Finally, we discuss $p$-neighborhood of vertex operator algebras, which is a special topological manipulation related to $\mathbb{Z}_p$-orbifolding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the dimensional reduction is applied to the Lee-Wick electrodynamics in which the classical sources are confined on a spatial plane. As result, the Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is achieved as a non-local electromagnetism defined in $1+2$ dimensions. The abelian Anderson-Higgs mechanism is so introduced in the Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics through a complex scalar sector in $1+2$ dimensions, breaking spontaneously the $U(1)$-gauge symmetry of the non-local theory. As consequence, the pseudo-Lee-Wick field acquires a light mass, beyond the usual heavy Lee-Wick mass, that is a natural mass parameter of the theory. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place, classical features of the theory are discussed, as the Proca-Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics, with the field equations and conservation laws. The introduction of Lee-Wick fermions also is proposed, in which it opens the discussion of a viable Proca-Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in $1+2$ dimensions. The unitarity at the tree level of the Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is discussed through the Optical theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various N=2 multiplets in four dimensions by looking at the supersymmetric truncation of four dimensional N=3 multiplets. Under supersymmetric truncation, the off-shell N=3 Weyl multiplet reduces to the off-shell N=2 Weyl multiplet and the off-shell N=2 vector multiplet (which we will refer to as the central charge multiplet). Under the same truncation, the on-shell N=3 vector multiplet reduces to the on-shell N=2 vector multiplet and an on-shell massive hypermultiplet with a broken rigid SU(2) and a non-trivial central charge transformation. We use the field equations of this hypermultiplet to eliminate some of the fields of the central charge multiplet in terms of the fields of the hypermultiplet and a dual tensor gauge field (similar in spirit to how a dilaton Weyl multiplet is constructed). This results in a new off-shell matter multiplet, with 8+8 degrees of freedom, containing scalar fields and a tensor gauge field, which we refer to as the scalar-tensor multiplet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the couplings of a partially massless spin-2 field with a doublet of massless, real spin-3/2 fields. In the flat limit, this spectrum coincides with the spectrum of ${\cal N}=2$ pure supergravity around anti-de Sitter spacetime AdS$_4$. We classify all the possible parity-invariant, non-Abelian deformations of the free theory that lead to a deformation of the Lagrangian. By doing this, we re-derive a non-Abelian vertex recently found in 2412.04982 [hep-th] by Yu. M. Zinoviev following a different approach, and show that the corresponding non-Abelian gauge algebra closely resembles the one of ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity around AdS$_4$. The gauge-algebra deformation is however obstructed, at next order. Then, we add a massless vector field together with a massive spin-3/2 field, and find two nontrivial vertices mixing these fields with a single massless gravitino. Still, the gauge algebra remains obstructed at next order, therefore excluding the possibility to make local the global supersymmetry algebra found in recent works on partially massless supermultiplets in AdS$_4$. Finally, we argue that the two problems encountered are simultaneously solved by the addition of the masseless graviton, leading to ${\cal N}=1$ pure conformal supergravity around AdS$_4$ as the only consistent theory coupling partially massless spin-2 fields to massless and massive spin-3/2 fields.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that the contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss for two-body scattering involving two radiation modes, $J_\text{2rad}$, is determined by the radiation-reaction contribution to the one-loop waveform. The latter is proportional to the tree-level one, and this reduces the calculation of $J_\text{2rad}$ to cut two-loop integrals. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>

      <title>Oblique photons, plasmons, and current-plasmons in relativistic plasmas and their topological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photons in vacuum are transverse in any inertial frame; longitudinal photons only exist virtually. By developing a manifestly covariant theory for electromagnetic excitations in relativistic plasmas and applying Wigner's little group method for elementary particle classifications, we show that photons in plasmas are neither transverse nor longitudinal; they are oblique. Plasmons are electromagnetic and oblique as well. The Lorentz invariant characteristics that distinguishes photons and plasmons is covariant compressibility. The manifestly covariant theory predicts the existence of the current-plasmon, a third oblique, electromagnetic eigenmode, and it also enables the study of photon topology in plasmas. Plasmas remove the photon's Dirac point in vacuum by giving it an effective mass, but create a tilted Dirac-Weyl point by reviving the virtual longitudinal photon. The manifest covariance of the theory demonstrates that relativistic transparency, despite being widely studied, does not exist in plasmas.</description>

      <title>Environmental cosmic acceleration from a phase transition in the dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new degravitation mechanism within the framework of scalar tensor gravity is postulated and included by prescription. The mechanism eliminates all constant contributions from the potential to the Friedmann equation, leaving only the kinematic and the dynamic terms of the potential to drive cosmic acceleration. We explore a scenario involving a density-triggered phase transition in the late-time universe, and argue that the resulting effective energy density and equation of state parameter can explain late-time cosmology when extrapolated to a region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>What is "quantum" about quantum gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the validity of the equivalence principle in the quantum regime, we argue that one of the assumptions of the usual definition of quantum mechanics, namely separation between the ``classical'' detector and the ``quantum'' system, must be relaxed. We argue, therefore, that if both the equivalence principle and quantum mechanics continue to survive experimental tests, that this favors ``epistemic'' interpretations of quantum mechanics (where formalism is built around relations between observables) over ``ontic ones'' (assuming the reality of states and wavefunctions). In particular, we show that relational type interpretations can readily accomodate the equivalence principle via a minor modification of the assumptions used to justify the formalism.
  We qualitatively speculate what a full generally covariant quantum dynamics could look like, and comment on experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Particle Production of Scalars: Analytic and Numerical Approaches Including Early Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) is a generic mechanism by which particles are produced during the inflationary epoch. In this work we consider the GPP of massive scalars in an effort to fully understand the spectrum of the produced particles. We consider scalars which are conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, as well as models of both early and late reheating. We numerically calculate the particle production in each scenario and compare the results to analytic approximations from boundary matching, Stokes phenomenon, steepest descent, and inflaton scattering methods. For each method, we describe the regime of validity and show that there is good agreement between the analytic and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Approaches to Cosmological Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode statistical properties of the initial conditions of our universe. Mathematically, they can often be written as Mellin integrals of a certain rational function associated to graphs, namely the flat space wavefunction. The singularities of these cosmological integrals are parameterized by binary hyperplane arrangements. Using different algebraic tools, we shed light on the differential and difference equations satisfied by these integrals. Moreover, we study a multivariate version of partial fractioning of the flat space wavefunction, and propose a graph-based algorithm to compute this decomposition.</description>

      <title>Kinematical breaking of symmetry : A physical interpretation of Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new interpretation of the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism is proposed. According to the basic premise of relativistic quantum field theory, the primitive world before the mass generation in fermions is a relativistic many-body state of virtual massless fermion and antifermion taking both timelike and spacelike paths. In order for the many-body state to have a physical meaning independently of observers, virtual massless fermions and antifermions there should move along a common direction of time, even if they are observed from any inertial fame. As a lowest-energy-state satisfying this condition, the physical vacuum with broken symmetry is derived. Since it is a kinematical breaking of symmetry, whatever effective interaction acts on massless fermion, it generates fermion's mass in the physical vacuum, because it escapes from the role of causing symmetry breaking. In the physical vacuum, virtual massless pairs of fermion and antifermion behave as quasi bosons. Due to Bose statistics, their transverse excitations are suppressed by an energy gap, which explains the origin of the vacuum condensate in the BEH potential. As a dynamical part of the above effective interaction, a Higgs-like excitation appears. This interpretation sheds a new light on the BEH mechanism.</description>

      <title>Holography dual of accelerating and rotating black hole in Nariai limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole, described by rotating C-metric, especially the case in Nariai limit, which are related to Kerr-CFT correspondence but differs in that the outer horizon will coincide the acceleration horizon and the extremal geometry is described by $dS_{2}$ rather than $AdS_{2}$. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <title>Collins-Soper Kernel in the QCD Instanton Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We outline a general framework for evaluating the non-perturbative soft functions in the QCD instanton vacuum. In particular, from the soft function we derive the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, which drives the rapidity evolution of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions. The resulting CS kernel, when supplemented with the perturbative contribution, agrees well with recent lattice results and some phenomenological parameterizations. Moreover, our CS kernel depends logarithmically on the large quark transverse separation, providing a key constraint on its phenomenological parametrization. Finally, a lattice calculation can be directly compared to our generic results in Euclidean signature, thus providing a new approach for evaluating the soft function and extracting the CS kernel by analytical continuation.</description>
