      <title>Pathwidth of 2-Layer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bipartite graph $G = (X \cup Y, E)$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar graph if it admits a drawing on the plane such that the vertices in $X$ and $Y$ are placed on two parallel lines respectively, edges are drawn as straight-line segments, and every edge involves at most $k$ crossings. Angelini, Da Lozzo, F\"orster, and Schneck [GD 2020; Comput. J., 2024] showed that every 2-layer $k$-planar graph has pathwidth at most $k + 1$. In this paper, we show that this bound is sharp by giving a 2-layer $k$-planar graph with pathwidth $k + 1$ for every $k \geq 0$. This improves their lower bound of $(k+3)/2$.</description>

      <title>Perfect Graph Modification Problems: An Integer Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph modification problems, which aim to find a small set of modifications to a graph so that it satisfies a desired property, have been studied for several special graph classes. The literature is rather rich in NP-completeness results and polynomial time solvable cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few exact algorithms have been suggested to address NP-hard cases. In this work, we propose exact solution methods based on integer programming for three perfect graph modification problems: minimum perfect editing, minimum perfect completion and the perfect sandwich problem. The minimum perfect editing problem inquires the smallest number of edge additions and deletions to make a graph perfect, while the completion problem allows only edge additions. In the perfect sandwich problem, only a given subset of non-edges can be changed to edges, and the problem asks whether a perfect graph can be obtained in this way. The proposed methods are based on the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem. We represent odd holes and odd antiholes as linear inequalities, and formulate an integer programming model to solve minimum perfect editing problem. To address the exponential number of constraints, we propose a cutting plane algorithm which relies on finding odd holes and odd antiholes. To enhance the practical efficiency of the cutting plane algorithm, we address the expected number of odd holes and odd antiholes in random graphs. In addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm to make a given graph perfect, which is used to obtain improved upper bounds for the editing and the completion problems. Finally, we demonstrate empirical effectiveness of the proposed methods through computational experiments.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of the block gluing classes of homshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A homshift is a $d$-dimensional shift of finite type which arises as the space of graph homomorphisms from the grid graph $\mathbb Z^d$ to a finite connected undirected graph $G$. While shifts of finite type are known to be mired by the swamp of undecidability, homshifts seem to be better behaved and there was hope that all the properties of homshifts are decidable. In this paper we build on the work by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha (arxiv:2211.04075) to show that finer mixing properties are undecidable for reasons completely different than the ones used to prove undecidability for general multidimensional shifts of finite type. Inspired by the work of Gao, Jackson, Krohne and Seward (arxiv:1803.03872) and elementary algebraic topology, we interpret the square cover introduced by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha topologically. Using this interpretation, we prove that it is undecidable whether a homshift is $\Theta(n)$-block gluing or not, by relating this problem to the one of finiteness for finitely presented groups.</description>

      <title>Curves, points, incidences and covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a point set, mostly a grid in our case, we seek upper and lower bounds on the number of curves that are needed to cover the point set. We say a curve covers a point if the curve passes through the point. We consider such coverings by monotonic curves, lines, orthoconvex curves, circles, etc. We also study a problem that is converse of the covering problem -- if a set of $n^2$ points in the plane is covered by $n$ lines then can we say something about the configuration of the points?</description>

      <title>Combinatorial properties of continuous graphs: A survey of challenges, solutions and open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by notorious combinatorial optimization problems on graphs, in this paper we consider a series of related problems defined using a metric space and topology determined by a graph. Particularly, we present the Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Chromatic Number and Treewidth problems on, so-called, continuous or metric graphs where every edge is represented by a unit-length continuous interval rather than by a pair of vertices. If any point of any unit-interval edge is considered as a possible member of a hitting set or a cover, the classical combinatorial problems become trickier and many open questions arise. Notably, in many real-life applications, such a continuous view of a graph is more natural than the classic combinatorial definition of a graph. The contribution of this paper is twofold: i) we survey the known results for optimization problems on continuous graphs, and ii) we create a list of open problems related to the continuous graphs.</description>

      <title>Generalized De Bruijn Words, Invertible Necklaces, and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define generalized de Bruijn words as those words having a Burrows-Wheeler transform that is a concatenation of permutations of the alphabet. We show that generalized de Bruijn words are in 1-to-1 correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime $p$, we define invertible necklaces as those whose BWT-matrix is non-singular. We show that invertible necklaces of length $n$ correspond to normal bases of the finite field $F_{p^n}$, and that they form an Abelian group isomorphic to the Reutenauer group $RG_p^n$. Using known results in abstract algebra, we can make a bridge between generalized de Bruijn words and invertible necklaces. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$'s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $F_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Barriers to Halving Algorithmic Information Quantities in Correlated Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of scaling down algorithmic information quantities in tuples of correlated strings. In particular, we address a question raised by Alexander Shen: whether, for any triple of strings \((a, b, c)\), there exists a string \(z\) such that each conditional Kolmogorov complexity \(C(a|z), C(b|z), C(c|z)\) is approximately half of the corresponding unconditional Kolmogorov complexity. We provide a negative answer to this question by constructing a triple \((a, b, c)\) for which no such string \(z\) exists. Moreover, we provide a fully explicit example of such a tuple. Our construction is based on combinatorial properties of incidences in finite projective planes and relies on recent bounds for point-line incidences over prime fields, obtained using tools from additive combinatorics and algebraic methods, notably results by Bourgain--Katz--Tao and Stevens--De Zeeuw. As an application, we show that this impossibility yields lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret key agreement protocols in certain settings. These results reveal algebraic obstructions to efficient information exchange and highlight a separation in information-theoretic behavior between fields with and without proper subfields.</description>
