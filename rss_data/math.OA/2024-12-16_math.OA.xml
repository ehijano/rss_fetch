      <title>On the rank of extremal marginal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ be two states on $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}$ and $\mathbb{C}^{d_2}$ respectively. The marginal state space, denoted by $\mathcal{C}(\rho_1,\rho_2)$, is the set of all states $\rho$ on $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_2}$ with partial traces $\rho_1, \rho_2$. K. R. Parthasarathy established that if $\rho$ is an extreme point of $\mathcal{C}(\rho_1,\rho_2)$, then the rank of $\rho$ does not exceed $\sqrt{d_1^2+d_2^2-1}$. Rudolph posed a question regarding the tightness of this bound. In 2010, Ohno gave an affirmative answer by providing examples in low-dimensional matrix algebras $\mathbb{M}_3$ and $\mathbb{M}_4$. This article aims to provide a positive answer to the Rudolph question in various matrix algebras. Our approaches, to obtain the extremal marginal states with tight upper bound, are based on Choi-Jamio\l kowski isomorphism and tensor product of extreme points.</description>

      <title>Nuclear dimension of groupoid C*-algebras with large abelian isotropy, with applications to C*-algebras of directed graphs and twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise when the C*-algebra $C^*(G)$ of a locally compact and Hausdorff groupoid $G$ is subhomogeneous, that is, when its irreducible representations have bounded finite dimension; if so we establish a bound for its nuclear dimension in terms of the topological dimensions of the unit space of the groupoid and the spectra of the primitive ideal spaces of the isotropy subgroups. For an \'etale groupoid $G$, we also establish a bound on the nuclear dimension of its $C^*$-algebra provided the quotient of $G$ by its isotropy subgroupid has finite dynamic asymptotic dimension in the sense of Guentner, Willet and Yu. Our results generalise those of C.~B\"oncicke and K.~Li to groupoids with large isotropy, including graph groupoids of directed graphs whose $C^*$-algebras are AF-embeddable: we find that the nuclear dimension of their $C^*$-algebras is at most $1$. We also show that the nuclear dimension of the $C^*$-algebra of a twist over $G$ has the same bound on the nuclear dimension as for $C^*(G)$ and the twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Real and complex K-theory for higher rank graph algebras arising from cube complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Evans spectral sequence and its counter-part for real $K$-theory, we compute both the real and complex $K$-theory of several infinite families of $C^*$-algebras based on higher-rank graphs of rank $3$ and $4$. The higher-rank graphs we consider arise from double-covers of cube complexes. By considering the real and complex $K$-theory together, we are able to carry these computations much further than might be possible considering complex $K$-theory alone. As these algebras are classified by $K$-theory, we are able to characterize the isomorphism classes of the graph algebras in terms of the combinatorial and number-theoretic properties of the construction ingredients.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry entails the Jordan algebra structure of quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various approaches to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles. Discrete and continuous symmetries are under consideration. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with three further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. The further requirements are: spectrality, a strong state space and a condition called gbit property.</description>
