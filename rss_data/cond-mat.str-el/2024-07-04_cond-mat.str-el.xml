      <title>When Could Abelian Fractional Topological Insulators Exist in Twisted MoTe$_2$ (and Other Systems)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using comprehensive exact diagonalization calculations on $\theta \approx 3.7 ^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), as well as idealized Landau level models also relevant for lower $\theta$, we extract general principles for engineering fractional topological insulators (FTIs) in realistic situations. First, in a Landau level setup at $\nu=1/3+1/3$, we investigate what features of the interaction destroy an FTI. For both pseudopotential interactions and realistic screened Coulomb interactions, we find that sufficient suppression of the short-range repulsion is needed for stabilizing an FTI. We then study $\theta \approx 3.7 ^{\circ}$ $t$MoTe$_2$ with realistic band-mixing and anisotropic non-local dielectric screening. Our finite-size calculations only find an FTI phase at $\nu=-4/3$ in the presence of a significant additional short-range attraction $g$ that acts to counter the Coulomb repulsion at short distances. We discuss how further finite-size drifts, dielectric engineering, Landau level character, and band-mixing effects may reduce the required value of $g$ closer towards the experimentally relevant conditions of $t$MoTe$_2$. Projective calculations into the $n=1$ Landau level, which resembles the second valence band of $\theta\simeq 2.1^\circ$ $t$MoTe$_2$, do not yield FTIs for any $g$, suggesting that FTIs at low-angle $t$MoTe$_2$ for $\nu=-8/3$ and $-10/3$ may be unlikely. While our study highlights the challenges, at least for the fillings considered, to obtaining an FTI with transport plateaus, even in large-angle $t$MoTe$_2$ where fractional Chern insulators are experimentally established, we also provide potential sample-engineering routes to improve the stability of FTI phases.</description>

      <title>Constraints on real space representations of Chern bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Chern band is characterized by a Wannier obstruction indicating the absence of a basis of complete, orthogonal, and exponentially-localized states. Here, we study the properties of real space bases of a Chern band obtained by relaxing either exponential localization or orthogonality and completeness. This yields two distinct real space representations of a band with Chern number $C$: (i) a basis of complete orthogonal Wannier states which decay as power-law and (ii) a basis of exponentially-localized overcomplete non-orthogonal coherent states. For (i), we show that the power-law tail only depends on the Chern number and provide an explicit gauge choice leading to the universal asymptotic $w({\boldsymbol r}) \approx \frac{C e^{-i C \varphi_{\boldsymbol r}}}{2\pi |{\boldsymbol r}|^2}$ up to a normalized Bloch-periodic spinor. For (ii), we prove a rigorous lower bound on the spatial spread that can always be saturated for ideal bands. We provide an explicit construction of the maximally localized coherent state by mapping the problem to a dual Landau level problem where the Berry curvature and trace of the quantum metric take the roles of an effective magnetic field and scalar potential, respectively. Our coherent state result rigorously bounds the spatial spread of any localized state constructed as a linear superposition of wavefunctions within the Chern band. Remarkably, we find that such bound does not generically scale with the Chern number and provide an explicit example of an exponentially localized state in a Chern $C$ band whose size does not increase with $|C|$. Our results show that band topology can be encoded in a real space description and set the stage for a systematic study of interaction effects in topological bands in real space.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic topological insulators in heavy-fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cooperation of electronic correlation and spin-orbit coupling can stabilize magnetic topological insulators which host novel quantum phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall state also known as Chern insulator (CI). Here, we investigate the existence of magnetic topological insulators with antiferromagnetic (AF) order in heavy-fermion materials. Our analysis relies on the half-filled Kane-Mele-Kondo (KMK) model with the AF Kondo interaction $J_{\rm K}$ coupling the spin of itinerant electrons with a $S=1/2$ localized spin at each lattice site. We consider the N\'eel AF ordering with the local magnetization not only perpendicular ($z$-AF ordering) but also parallel ($xy$-AF ordering) to the honeycomb plane. We show that in the absence of an energy offset between the two sublattices of the honeycomb structure the system is always topologically trivial. There is a transition from the trivial $xy$-AF insulator ($xy$-AFI) to the trivial Kondo insulator (KI) upon increasing $J_{\rm K}$. We unveil that an alternating sublattice potential can lead to the stabilization of the $z$-AFCI and the $z$-AF quantum spin Hall insulator ($z$-AFQSHI). We address the charge excitations in the bulk as well as at the edges of the KMK model. We provide a systematic comparison between the size of the charge gap in the AFCI in heavy-fermion materials and the size of the charge gap in the AFCI in transition-metal compounds. Our findings can guide the future experimental studies searching for AF topological insulators in novel class of systems which can survive up to higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spin-Triplet Superconductivity Induced by All-In-All-Out Spin Fluctuation in Pyrochlore Electronic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetry of superconductivity around the All-In-All-Out (AIAO) spin ordered phase in a nearly half-filled pyrochlore electronic system. The electronic system is described by the Hubbard model with an anti-symmetric spin-orbit coupling. The AIAO spin ordered state is formed by arranging tetrahedral hedgehog spin-clusters uniformly in the lattice system, where 12 types of spin-clusters are allowed in a unit cell. All spin-cluster susceptibilities are calculated within the random phase approximation with respect to the onsite electron interaction. It is shown that, for the negative spin-orbit coupling coefficient, the AIAO spin-cluster susceptibility diverges at q=0, while other types of spin-cluster susceptibilities are not developed and are structureless. By calculating the superconducting transition mediated by AIAO spin fluctuation, it is found that a spin-triplet superconductivity appears, while there is no signal of superconducting transition for the spin-singlet one. We suggest that the spin-triplet superconductivity appears around the AIAO spin ordered phase in the pyrochlore lattice.</description>

      <title>Topological phase in the extended Haldane-Hubbard model with sublattice-dependent repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of the half-filled extended Haldane-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with sublattice-dependent on-site repulsion ($U_{\text{A/B}}$) using the exact diagonalization (ED) and mean-field (MF) methods. The resulting phase diagram shows that there is a topologically nontrivial phase with the Chern number $C=1$, emerging via the development of the imbalance between $U_{\text{A}}$ and $U_{\text{B}}$. In this phase, the antiferromagnetic correlations are observed in the ED calculation, in line with the finite antiferromagnetic order obtained by the MF method. The spontaneous symmetry breaking of SU(2) spin rotation in the phase is also identified in the MF level. Distinct from previous studies in which the exotic $C=1$ phase relies on the interplay between sublattice-dependent potentials and electronic interactions, our paper presents an alternative way by solely tuning the on-site interactions.</description>

      <title>Current-induced motion of nanoscale magnetic torons over the wide range of the Hall angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-driven dynamics of spin textures plays a pivotal role in potential applications for electronic devices. While two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions with topologically nontrivial spin textures have garnered significant interest, their practical use is hindered by the skyrmion Hall effect $\unicode{x2014}$ a transverse motion to the current direction that occurs as a counteraction to the topological Hall effect of electrons by an emergent magnetic field arising from the Berry phase effect. Here, we explore current-driven dynamics of three-dimensional topological spin textures known as magnetic torons, composed of layered skyrmions with two singularities called Bloch points at their ends. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that the torons also exhibit a Hall motion, but surprisingly over a wide range spanning from the zero Hall effect, a purely longitudinal motion, to the perfect Hall effect, a purely transverse motion accompanied by no longitudinal motion. Such flexible and controllable behaviors stem from anisotropic potential barriers on the discrete lattice, which can be particularly relevant for nanoscale torons recently discovered. Our results not only provide an experimental method to probe topology of three-dimensional magnetic textures but also pave the way for future developments in topological spintronics beyond the realm of skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Disentangling heterogeneity and disorder during ultrafast surface melting of orbital order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how light modifies long-range order is key to improve our ability to control material functionality on an ultrafast timescale. Transient spatial heterogeneity has been proposed in many materials, but isolating the dynamics of different regions experimentally has been challenging. Here we address this issue and measure the dynamics of orbital order melting in the layered manganite, La0.5Sr1.5MnO4, and isolate the surface dynamics from the bulk for the first time. Bulk measurements show orbital order is rapidly suppressed, but the correlation length surprisingly increases. However, the surface dynamics, show a stronger suppression and a significant decrease in correlation length. By isolating the surface changes, we find that light preferentially melts a less ordered surface and the loss of long-range order is likely driven by the formation of local and disordered polarons. Melting the disordered surface effectively increases the average correlation of the bulk probed volume, resolving the contradictory response. These results show that surface scattering methods are necessary to understand both surface and bulk dynamics in heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <title>Insulating and metallic phases in the one-dimensional Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: Insights from a backflow-inspired variational wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions is studied in a one-dimensional lattice model, by means of a variational Monte Carlo method based on generalized Jastrow-Slater wave functions. Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Clifford Circuits Augmented Time-Dependent Variational Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CA-MPS) (arXiv:2405.09217) seamlessly augments Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Clifford circuits. In CA-MPS, the entanglement from stabilizers is transferred to the Clifford circuits which can be easily handled according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. As a result, MPS needs only to deal with the non-stabilizer entanglement, which largely reduce the bond dimension and the resource required for the accurate simulation of many-body systems. In this work, we generalize CA-MPS to the framework of Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) for time evolution simulations. In this method, we apply Clifford circuits to the resulting MPS in each TDVP step with a two-site sweeping process similar as in DMRG, aiming at reducing the entanglement entropy in the MPS, and the Hamiltonian is transformed accordingly using the chosen Clifford circuits. Similar as in CA-MPS, the Clifford circuits doesn't increase the number of terms in the Hamiltonian which makes the overhead very small in the new method. We test this method in both XXZ chain and two dimensional Heisenberg model. The results show that the Clifford circuits augmented TDVP method can reduce the entanglement entropy in the time evolution process and hence makes the simulation reliable for longer time. The Clifford circuits augmented Time-Dependent Variational Principle provides a useful tool for the simulation of time evolution process of many-body systems in the future.</description>

      <title>`Interaction annealing' to determine effective quantized valence and orbital structure: an illustration with ferro-orbital order in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct emergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, the superposition principle of quantum mechanics ensures that, upon absorbing quantum fluctuation, these rich low-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles with fully quantized charge, spin, and orbitals structure. Such a powerful and simple description is, however, difficult to access through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, since in terms of bare particles the quantum fluctuation would heavily smear the quantized quantities. To address this difficulty, we propose an `interaction annealing' approach to decipher the dominant valence and orbital structure by suppressing the charge fluctuation through enhancing ionic charging energy. Applying this approach to ferroelectric semi-metal WTe${_2}$ as a demonstration, we identify a dominant ferro-orbital ordered structure with W ion in a $d^2$ spin-0 configuration. The proposed approach is straightforward to implement in standard DFT calculations to grant additional access to essential low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Crystal-field effects in the formation of Wigner-molecule supercrystals in moir\'e TMD superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For moir\'e bilayer TMD superlattices, full-configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations are presented that take into account both the intra-moir\'e-quantum-dot (MQD) charge-carrier Coulombic interactions, as well as the crystal-field effect from the surrounding moir\'e pockets (inter-moir\'e-QD interactions). Such FCI calculations enable an effective computational embedding strategy and allow for a complete interpretation of the counterintuitive experimental observations reported recently in the context of moir\'e TMD superlattices at integer fillings $\nu=2$ and 4. Two novel states of matter are reported: (i) a genuinely quantum-mechanical supercrystal of {\it sliding\/} Wigner molecules (WMs) for unstrained moir\'e TMD materials (when the crystal field is commensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD) and (ii) a supercrystal of {\it pinned\/} Wigner molecules when strain is involved and the crystal field is incommensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD. The case of $\nu=3$ is an exception, in that both unstrained and strained cases produce a supercrystal of pinned WMs, which is due to the congruence of intrinsic (that of the WM) and external (that of the confining potential of the MQD) $C_3$ point-group symmetries. Furthermore, it is shown that the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach fails to describe the supercrystal of sliding WMs in the unstrained case, providing a qualitative agreement only in the case of a supercrystal of pinned WMs</description>

      <title>Supercell Wannier functions and faithful low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a minimal low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene and related rhombohedral graphene multilayers at low electronic densities by constructing Wannier orbitals defined in real-space supercells of the original primitive cell. Starting from an ab-initio electronic structure theory comprising the atomic carbon $p_z$-orbitals, momentum locality of the Fermi surface pockets around $K,K'$ is circumvented by backfolding the $\pi$-bands to the concomitant mini-Brillouin zone of the supercell, reminiscent of their (twisted) moir\'e counterparts. The supercell Wannier functions reproduce the spectral weight and Berry curvature of the microscopic model and offer an intuitive real-space picture of the emergent physics at low electronic densities being shaped by flavor-polarized wave packets with mesoscopic extent. By projecting an orbital-resolved, dual-gated Coulomb interaction to the effective Wannier basis, we find that the low-energy physics of Bernal bilayer graphene is governed by weak electron-electron interactions. Our study bridges between existing continuum theories and ab-initio studies of small Fermi pocket systems like rhombohedral graphene stacks by providing a symmetric lattice description of their low-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials combine multiple ferroic orders that may enable cross-functionalities, e.g. control of one ferroic order by the field conjugate to the other one. BaCoSiO$_4$, a recently proposed multiferroic combines multiple unit cell-tripling modes, structural chirality and ferroelectric polarization, whose interactions result in a peculiar ground state. We derive the Landau free energy for interacting trimerization, electric polarization and structural chiral modes and find the corresponding coefficients from first-principles calculations. This results in a quantitative model for the description of domain walls and vortices, observed in recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Electronic Structure of NiPS$_3$ through Synchrotron-Based ARPES and Alkali Metal Dosing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the band structure in NiPS$_3$, a van der Waals layered antiferromagnet, utilizing high-resolution synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and corroborative density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By tuning the parameters of the light source, we obtained a very clear and wide energy range band structure of NiPS$_3$. Comparison with DFT calculations allows for the identification of the orbital character of the observed bands. Our DFT calculations perfectly match the experimental results, and no adaptations were made to the calculations based on the experimental outcomes. The appearance of novel electronic structure upon alkali metal dosing (AMD) were also obtained in this ARPES study. Above valence band maximum, structure of conduction bands and bands from defect states were firstly observed in NiPS$_3$. We provide the direct determination of the band gap of NiPS$_3$ as 1.3 eV from the band structure by AMD. In addition, detailed temperature dependent ARPES spectra were obtained across a range that spans both below and above the N\'eel transition temperature of NiPS$_3$. We found that the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states have almost identical spectra, indicating the highly localized nature of Ni $d$ states.</description>

      <title>Inducing superconductivity in quantum anomalous Hall regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing the quantum anomalous Hall insulator with a conventional superconductor is known to be a promising manner for realizing a topological superconductor, which has been continuously pursued for years. Such a proximity route depends to a great extent on the control of the delicate interfacial coupling of the two constituents. However, a recent experiment reported the failure to reproduce such a topological superconductor, which is ascribed to the negligence of the electrical short by the superconductor in the theoretical proposal. Here, we reproduce this topological superconductor with attention to the interface control. The resulted conductance matrix under a wide magnetic field range agrees with the fingerprint of this topological superconductor. This allows us to develop a phase diagram that unveils three regions parameterized by various coupling limits, which not only supports the feasibility to fabricate the topological superconductor by proximity but also fully explains the origin of the previous debate. The present work provides a comprehensible guide on fabricating the topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Fermi Surface Nesting Driving the RKKY Interaction in the Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Magnet Gd2PdSi3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic skyrmions generated in a centrosymmetric crystal were recently first discovered in Gd2PdSi3. In light of this, we observe the electronic structure by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and unveil its direct relationship with the magnetism in this compound. The Fermi surface and band dispersions are demonstrated to have a good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations carried out with careful consideration of the crystal superstructure. Most importantly, we find that the three-dimensional Fermi surface has extended nesting which matches well the q-vector of the magnetic order detected by recent scattering measurements. The consistency we find among ARPES, DFT, and the scattering measurements suggests the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction involving itinerant electrons to be the formation mechanism of skyrmions in Gd2PdSi3.</description>

      <title>Integrability and dark states of the XX spin-1 central spin model in a transverse field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that, for central spin-1/2 and central spin-1, the XX central spin model is integrable in the presence of a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the XY plane in which the coupling exists. In the spin-1/2 case, it was also shown, through an appropriate limit of the non-skew symmetric XXZ Richardson-Gaudin models, that it remained integrable even when the magnetic field is tilted to contain an in-plane component. Although the model has not yet been shown to explicitly belong to a known class of Richardson- Gaudin models, we show, in this work, that the spin-1 case also remains integrable in a titled magnetic field. We do so by writing explicitly the complete set of conserved charges, then showing that these operators obey polynomial relations. It is finally demonstrated numerically that dark states, for which the central spin is completely unentangled with the bath, can emerge at strong enough coupling just as they do in the central spin-1/2 model in an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Tensor Networks for Lattice Gauge Theories beyond one dimension: a Roadmap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods are a class of numerical tools and algorithms to study many-body quantum systems in and out of equilibrium, based on tailored variational wave functions. They have found significant applications in simulating lattice gauge theories approaching relevant problems in high-energy physics. Compared to Monte Carlo methods, they do not suffer from the sign problem, allowing them to explore challenging regimes such as finite chemical potentials and real-time dynamics. Further development is required to tackle fundamental challenges, such as accessing continuum limits or computations of large-scale quantum chromodynamics. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of Tensor Network methods and discuss a possible roadmap for algorithmic development and strategies to enhance their capabilities and extend their applicability to open high-energy problems. We provide tailored estimates of the theoretical and computational resource scaling for attacking large-scale lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Band Structure in a Kagome Superconductor Cs(V1-xCrx)3Sb5: Toward Universal Understanding of CDW and Superconducting Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a characteristic superconducting and charge-density wave (CDW) phase diagram upon carrier doping and chemical substitution. However, the key electronic states responsible for such a phase diagram have yet to be clarified. Here we report a systematic micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of Cs(V1-xCrx)3Sb5 as a function of Cr content x, where Cr substitution causes monotonic reduction of superconducting and CDW transition temperatures. We found that the V-derived bands forming saddle points at the M point and Dirac nodes along high-symmetry cuts show an energy shift due to electron doping by Cr substitution, whereas the Sb-derived electron band at the Gamma point remains almost unchanged, signifying an orbital-selective band shift. We also found that band doubling associated with the emergence of three-dimensional CDW identified at x = 0 vanishes at x = 0.25, in line with the disappearance of CDW. A comparison of band diagrams among Ti-, Nb-, and Cr-substituted Cs(V1-xCrx)3Sb5 suggests the importance to simultaneously take into account the two saddle points at the M point and their proximity to the Fermi energy, to understand the complex phase diagram against carrier doping and chemical pressure.</description>

      <title>Origin of anomalous magnetotransport in kagome superconductors AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A=K,Rb,Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple anomalous features in electronic spectra of metals with kagome lattice structure -- van Hove singularities, Dirac points, and flat bands -- imply that materials containing this structural motif may lie at a nexus of topological and correlated electron physics. Due to the prospects of such exceptional electronic behavior, the recent discovery of superconductivity coexisting with charge-density wave (CDW) order in the layered kagome metals AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) has attracted considerable attention. Notably, these kagome metals express unconventional magnetotransport behavior, including a linear-in-H diagonal resistivity at low fields, and an even more peculiar, nonmonotonic sign-changing behavior of the Hall resistivity, which has been speculated to arise from a chiral CDW. We argue here that this unusual magnetotransport derives not from such unconventional phenomena, but rather from the unique fermiology of the AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ materials. Specifically, it is caused by a large, concave hexagonal Fermi surface sheet formed in the close proximity to the van Hove singularities, which is backfolded into a small hexagonal sheet and two large triangular sheets in the CDW state. We introduce a model of the electronic structure of these Fermi surface sheets that allows for a full analytical treatment within Boltzmann kinetic theory and that enables semi-quantitative fits of our transport data. Specifically, we find that the anomalous magnetotransport behavior is caused by the confluence of strong reduction of the Fermi velocity near the van Hove singularities located near the vertices of the hexagonal sheet and sharp corners in Fermi surface generated by the CDW reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Engineering of Magnetic Anisotropy from Anomalous Hall Effect in Synthetic SrRuO3 Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in atomically thin correlated heterostructures is essential for exploring quantum magnetic phases for next-generation spintronics. Whereas previous studies have mostly focused on van der Waals systems, here, we investigate the impact of dimensionality of epitaxially-grown correlated oxides down to the monolayer limit on structural, magnetic, and orbital anisotropies. By designing oxide superlattices with a correlated ferromagnetic SrRuO3 and nonmagnetic SrTiO3 layers, we observed modulated ferromagnetic behavior with the change of the SrRuO3 thickness. Especially, for three-unit-cell-thick layers, we observe a significant 1,500% improvement of coercive field in the anomalous Hall effect, which cannot be solely attributed to the dimensional crossover in ferromagnetism. The atomic-scale heterostructures further reveal the systematic modulation of anisotropy for the lattice structure and orbital hybridization, explaining the enhanced magnetic anisotropy. Our findings provide valuable insights into engineering the anisotropic hybridization of synthetic magnetic crystals, offering a tunable spin order for various applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved. The answer to this question is hindered by the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without needing a periodic moir\'e supercell. We adopt a momentum-space model for the electronic and phonon structures and quantify the EPC using generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory for superconductivity without an adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is significantly enhanced near the magic angle, and drops abruptly for larger twist angles. We show that the EPC strength of a phonon corresponds to the modification of the moir\'e potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, including one layer breathing mode, three layer shearing modes, and one chiral mode. These phonons should be experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Probed by Chiral Excitonic Optical Response of Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically derive the sum rule for the negative first moment of the absorptive optical conductivity with excitonic effects and establish its connection to the quantum weight $K$ and Chern number $C$ of the ground state. Applying this framework, we investigate the excitonic optical response of the Chern insulator at hole filling factor $\nu=1$ in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. A single chiral exciton state, which selectively absorbs circularly polarized light of a specific handedness, dominates the optical sum rule. The chiral exciton state comprises two types of interlayer electron-hole transitions, which cancel out the total out-of-plane dipole moment. The absorption spectrum shows nearly perfect magnetic circular dichroism, which can be attributed to the nearly saturated bound $K \ge |C|$ of the Chern insulator under study. Our work illustrates the potential of using excitonic optical responses to probe quantum geometry encoded by $K$ and $C$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of quantum dot arrays of moir\'e triangular superlattices. Starting from a reciprocal space model, we use the projection technique to obtain maximally localized Wannier functions and determine generalized Hubbard model parameters. The many-body Hamiltonian is solved using the exact diagonalization method as a function of the number of electrons in differently shaped quantum dots arrays. Finite spin polarization is observed within a wide range of filling factors for small twist angles and sufficiently strong interactions in most of the studied structures. The prospect for a magnetization controlled by applying a displacement field is presented. In the vicinity of half-filling, signatures of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in moir\'e materials are seen, which we demonstrate by comparing results with the corresponding on-site Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 Dimensions as the Organizing Principle of a Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions (QED$_3$) has been proposed as a critical field theory describing the low-energy effective theory of a putative algebraic Dirac spin liquid or of quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional frustrated magnets. We provide compelling evidence that the intricate spectrum of excitations of the elementary but strongly frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice is in one-to-one correspondence to a zoo of excitations from QED$_3$, in the quantum spin liquid regime. This includes a large manifold of explicitly constructed monopole and bilinear excitations of QED$_3$, which is thus shown to serve as an organizing principle of phases of matter in triangular lattice antiferromagnets and their low-lying excitations. Moreover, we observe signatures of an emergent valence bond solid (VBS), which suggests a scenario where only the critical point of a transition from the $120^\circ$ N\'eel order to a VBS is described by QED$_3$. Our results are obtained by comparing ansatz wave functions from a parton construction to exact eigenstates obtained using large-scale exact diagonalization up to $N=48$ sites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a $d-2$-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as $U(1)$ gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.</description>

      <title>System identification based on characteristic curves: a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier analysis for first-order nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the sinosoidal output response in power series (SORPS) formalism was presented for system identification and simulation. Based on the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), it establishes a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier series for a first-order nonlinear system [F. J. Gonzalez, Sci. Rep. 13, 1955, (2023)]. However, the system identification procedure discussed there, based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), presents the limitations of requiring a sinusoidal single tone for the dynamical variable and equally spaced time steps for the input-output dataset (DS). These limitations are here addressed by introducing a different approach: we use a power series-based model for system modeling using two hyperparameters $\hat{A}_0$ and $\hat{A}_1$ optimally defined depending on the DS. Overall, this work expands the applicability of the SORPS formalism to arbitrary DSs and represents a groundbreaking contribution for the concept of CCs. The method of CCs is complementary to the commonly used approaches of NARMAX-models and sparse regression techniques, which emphasize the estimation of the individual parameter values of the model. However, the CCs-based methods emphasize the computation of the CCs as a whole, thus presenting the advantages that the system identification is uniquely defined, and that it can be applied for any system without additional algebraic operations. Thus, the parsimonious principle defined by the NARMAX-philosophy is extended from the concept of a model with as few parameters as possible to the concept of finding the lowest model order that correctly describe the input-output DS. This opens up a wide variety of potential applications in vibration analysis, structural dynamics, viscoelastic materials, nonlinear electric circuits, voltammetry techniques, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Absence of measurement-induced entanglement transition due to feedback-induced skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11241v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum many-body system subject to unitary evolution and repeated local measurements with an increasing rate undergoes a measurement-induced entanglement transition from extensive (or subextensive) to area law entropy scaling. We find that certain open boundary systems under "generalized monitoring", consisting of "projective monitoring" and conditional feedback, display an anomalous late-time particle concentration on the edge, reminiscent of the "skin effect" in non-Hermitian systems. Such feedback-induced skin effect will suppress the entanglement generation, rendering the system short-range entangled without measurement-induced entanglement transition. While initially emerged in noninteracting models, such skin effect can also occur in chaotic interacting systems and Floquet quantum circuits subjected to random generalized measurements. Since the dynamics of the skin effect do not require post selection, and can be observed at the particle number level, the phenomenon is experimentally relevant and accessible in noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms, such as trapped ions.</description>

Abstract: The quantum simulation of magnetism in trapped-ion systems makes use of the crystal vibrations to mediate pairwise interactions between spins, which are encoded in the internal electronic states of the ions, and measured in experiments that probe the real-time dynamics. These interactions can be accounted for by a long-wavelength relativistic theory, where the phonons are described by a coarse-grained Klein-Gordon field $\phi(x)$ locally coupled to the spins that acts as a carrier, leading to an analogue of pion-mediated Yukawa interactions. In the vicinity of a structural transition of the ion crystal, one must go beyond the Klein-Gordon fields, and include additional $\lambda\phi^4$ terms responsible for phonon-phonon scattering. This leads to quantum effects that can be expressed by Feynman loop integrals that modify the range of the Yukawa-type spin interactions; an effect that could be used to probe the underlying fixed point of this quantum field theory (QFT). Unfortunately, the rigidity of the trapped-ion crystal makes it challenging to observe genuine quantum effects, such as the flow of the critical point with the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We hereby show that thermal effects, which can be controlled by laser cooling, can unveil this flow through the appearance of thermal masses in interacting QFTs. We perform self-consistent calculations that resum certain Feynman diagrams and, additionally, go beyond mean-field theory to predict how measurements on the trapped-ion spin system can probe key properties of the $\lambda\phi^4$ QFT.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermion induced power-law scaling in the violation of Wiedemann-Franz law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Keldysh field theory of dynamical exciton condensation transitions in nonequilibrium electron-hole bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized steady-state electrical injection of interlayer excitons in electron-hole bilayers subject to a large bias voltage. In the ideal case in which interlayer tunneling is negligibly weak, the system is in quasi-equilibrium with a reduced effective band gap. Interlayer tunneling introduces a current and drives the system out of equilibrium. In this work we derive a nonequilibrium field theory description of interlayer excitons in biased electron-hole bilayers. In the large bias limit, we find that p-wave interlayer tunneling reduces the effective band gap and increases the effective temperature for intervalley excitons. We discuss possible experimental implications for InAs/GaSb quantum wells and transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter critical quantum metrology with impurity probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems can be used as probes in the context of metrology for enhanced parameter estimation. In particular, the delicacy of critical systems to perturbations can make them ideal sensors. Arguably the simplest realistic probe system is a spin-1/2 impurity, which can be manipulated and measured in-situ when embedded in a fermionic environment. Although entanglement between a single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body effects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead the two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum metrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite temperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and obtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the inter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR). However, with uncertainty in both coupling strength and temperature, the multiparameter QFI matrix becomes singular -- even though the parameters to be estimated are independent -- resulting in vanishing QSNRs. We demonstrate that by applying a known control field, the singularity can be removed and measurement sensitivity restored. For general systems, we show that the degradation in the QSNR due to uncertainties in another parameter is controlled by the degree of correlation between the unknown parameters.</description>

      <title>Machian fractons, Hamiltonian attractors and non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $N$ fracton problem in classical mechanics, with fractons defined as point particles that conserve multipole moments up to a given order. We find that the nonlinear Machian dynamics of the fractons is characterized by late-time attractors in position-velocity space for all $N$, despite the absence of attractors in phase space dictated by Liouville's theorem. These attractors violate ergodicity and lead to non-equilibrium steady states, which always break translational symmetry, even in spatial dimensions where the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner-Coleman theorem for equilibrium systems forbids such breaking. While a full understanding of the many-body nonlinear problem is a formidable and incomplete task, we provide a conceptual understanding of our results using an adiabatic approximation for the late-time trajectories and an analogy with the idea of `order-by-disorder' borrowed from equilibrium statistical mechanics. Altogether, these fracton systems host a new paradigm for Hamiltonian dynamics and non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping frustrated magnets: the fate of the chiral ${\rm O}(N)\times {\rm O}(2)$ universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>Linear spectroscopy of collective modes and the gap structure in two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider optical response in multi-band, multi-layer two-dimensional superconductors. Within a simple model, we show that linear response to AC gating can detect collective modes of the condensate, such as Leggett and clapping modes. We show how trigonal warping of the superconducting order parameter can help facilitate detection of clapping modes. Taking rhombohedral trilayer graphene as an example, we consider several possible pairing mechanisms and show that all-electronic mechanisms may produce in-gap clapping modes. These modes, if present, should be detectable in the absorption of microwaves applied via the gate electrodes, which are necessary to enable superconductivity in this and many other settings; their detection would constitute strong evidence for unconventional pairing. Lastly, we show that absorption at frequencies above the superconducting gap $2 |\Delta|$ also contains a wealth of information about the gap structure. Our results suggest that linear spectroscopy can be a powerful tool for the characterization of unconventional two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>
