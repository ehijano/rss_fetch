      <title>Matching with a Status Quo: The Agreeable Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a framework to unify classic models of two-sided matching with recent models of recontracting. In the classic model, agents from two sides must be matched; in models of recontracting, agents improve a status quo match. We generalize the core (matches not blocked by any coalition) from cooperative game theory to our setting by restricting the set of permissible coalitions to coalitions containing neither or both agents in a status quo match, dubbed "agreeable" coalitions. The agreeable core is the set of all weak improvements of the status quo that are not blocked by any agreeable coalition. Our main result is that the agreeable core is nonempty and can be found through a computationally efficient and economically meaningful algorithm: our Propose-Exchange algorithm. The applications of the agreeable core include early decision, out-of-match agreements in the NRMP, matching with minimum constraints, and efficiency in school choice.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design by a Politician</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of agents has to make a decision about the provision of a public good and its financing. Agents have heterogeneous values for the public good and each agent's value is private information. An agenda-setter has the right to make a proposal about a public-good level and a vector of contributions. For the proposal to be approved, only the favourable votes of a subset of agents are needed. If the proposal is not approved, a type-dependent outside option is implemented. I characterize the optimal public-good provision and the coalition-formation for any outside option in dominant strategies. Optimal public-good provision might be a non-monotonic function of the outside option public-good level. Moreover, the optimal coalition might be a non-convex set of types.</description>

      <title>Equality of Opportunity and Opportunity Pluralism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper seeks to explore the potential trade-off arising between the theories of $\textit{Equality of Opportunity}$ and $\textit{Opportunity Pluralism}$. Whereas the first theory has received much attention in the literature on Welfare Economics, the second one has only recently been introduced with the publication of the book by Joseph Fishkin, $\textit{Bottlenecks: A New Theory of Equal Opportunity}$. After arguing extensively that any notion of human flourishing is incompatible with traditional theories of $\textit{Equality of Opportunity}$, the author proposes an alternative theory squarely based on a broad notion of human development. This paper seeks to formalize the argument made in this book through the lens of economic theory. My analysis suggests that traditional theories of $\textit{Equality of Opportunity}$ are not incompatible with $\textit{Opportunity Pluralism}$.</description>

      <title>Finding all stable matchings with assignment constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03989v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider stable matchings subject to assignment constraints. These are matchings that require certain assigned pairs to be included, insist that some other assigned pairs are not, and, importantly, are stable. Our main contribution is an algorithm, based on the iterated deletion of unattractive alternatives, that determines if assignment constraints are compatible with stability. Whenever there is a stable matching that satisfies the assignment constraints, our algorithm outputs all of them (each in polynomial time per solution). This provides market designers with (i) a tool to test the feasibility of stable matchings subject to assignment constraints, and (ii) a tool to implement them when feasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02989v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study a model of information acquisition and transmission in which the sender's ability to misreport her findings is limited. In equilibrium, the sender only influences the receiver by choosing to remain selectively ignorant, rather than by deceiving her about the discoveries. Although deception does not occur, I highlight how deception possibilities determine what information the sender chooses to acquire and transmit. I then turn to comparative statics, characterizing in which sense the sender benefits from her claims being more verifiable, showing this is akin to increasing her commitment power. Finally, I characterize sender- and receiver-optimal falsification environments.</description>

      <title>LQG Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses information design with linear best responses of agents, quadratic objective functions of an information designer, and a payoff state distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as semidefinite programming (SDP) and use the duality principle to characterize an optimal information structure. There exists a Gaussian information structure that is optimal among all information structures. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is that the realizations of the induced action profile and a state satisfy linear constraints derived from the primal and dual SDP. As a result, an observed action profile typically reveals the true state even if individual agents have only partial knowledge. In symmetric network games, an optimal information structure inherits this symmetry, which facilitates the computation of an optimal information structure.</description>

      <title>Learning Macroeconomic Policies based on Microfoundations: A Dynamic Stackelberg Mean Field Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lucas critique emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of policy changes on the expectations of micro-level agents in macroeconomic policymaking. However, the inherently self-interested nature of large-scale micro-agents, who pursue long-term benefits, complicates the formulation of optimal macroeconomic policies. This paper proposes a novel general framework named Dynamic Stackelberg Mean Field Games (Dynamic SMFG) to model such policymaking within sequential decision-making processes, with the government as the leader and households as dynamic followers. Dynamic SMFGs capture the dynamic interactions among large-scale households and their response to macroeconomic policy changes. To solve dynamic SMFGs, we propose the Stackelberg Mean Field Reinforcement Learning (SMFRL) algorithm, which leverages the population distribution of followers to represent high-dimensional joint state and action spaces. In experiments, our method surpasses macroeconomic policies in the real world, existing AI-based and economic methods. It allows the leader to approach the social optimum with the highest performance, while large-scale followers converge toward their best response to the leader's policy. Besides, we demonstrate that our approach retains effectiveness even when some households do not adopt the SMFG policy. In summary, this paper contributes to the field of AI for economics by offering an effective tool for modeling and solving macroeconomic policy-making issues.</description>
