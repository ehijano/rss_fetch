      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Designing Complexity? The Role of Self-Organization in Urban planning and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter explores the concept of self-organization in urban planning and design, highlighting its role in shaping the unique characteristics of cities. It examines how various socio-economic, cultural, and political factors contribute to the development of distinct architectural styles, emphasizing the morphological patterns and self-organization principles. The chapter addresses the emergence of scaling laws and fractal geometry in urban forms, using historical and contemporary examples to illustrate these concepts. The discussion also delves into the cognitive aspects of urban design, examining how the physical layout of cities influences cognitive maps and perceptions of urban environments, and how these perceptions, in turn, influence urban design. Through the prism of self-organization, it demonstrates the dynamic interplay between individual and collective actions and the shaping of the urban landscape. This analysis offers insights into the complex, self-organizing systems that define urban spaces, emphasizing the interdependencies among architectural design, urban planning, and human cognition in shaping cityscapes.</description>

      <title>Optimal prevention strategies for chronic diseases in an compartmental disease trajectory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In countries with growing elderly populations, multimorbidity poses a significant healthcare challenge. The trajectories along which diseases accumulate as patients age and how they can be targeted by prevention efforts are still not fully understood. We propose a compartmental model, traditionally used in infectious diseases, describing chronic disease trajectories across 132 distinct multimorbidity patterns (compartments). Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from approximately 45 million hospital stays spanning 17 years in Austria, our compartmental disease trajectory model (CDTM) forecasts changes in the incidence of 131 diagnostic groups and their combinations until 2030, highlighting patterns involving hypertensive diseases with cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. We pinpoint specific diagnoses with the greatest potential for preventive interventions to promote healthy aging. According to our model, a reduction of new onsets by 5% of hypertensive diseases (I10-I15) leads to a reduction in all-cause mortality over a period of 15 years by 0.57 (0.06)% and for malignant neoplasms (C00-C97) mortality is reduced by 0.57 (0.07)%. Furthermore, we use the model to assess the long-term consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on hospitalizations, revealing earlier and more frequent hospitalizations across multiple diagnoses. Our fully data-driven approach identifies leverage points for proactive preparation by physicians and policymakers to reduce the overall disease burden in the population, emphasizing a shift towards patient-centered care.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of information bubbles on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper to introduce a new model of evolvement of narratives (common opinions, information bubble) on networks. Our main tools come from invariant mean theory and graph theory. The case, when the root set of the network (influencers, news agencies, etc.) is ergodic is fully discussed. The other possibility, when the root contains more than one component is partially discussed and it could be a motivation for further research.</description>

      <title>Breaking consensus in kinetic opinion formation models on graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided the show the effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering the system towards a declustered state.</description>

      <title>Dynamical importance and network perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the adjacency matrix of a graph exerts much influence on the behavior of dynamical processes on that graph. It is thus relevant to relate notions of the importance (specifically, centrality measures) of network structures to $\lambda$ and its associated eigenvector. We study a previously derived measure of edge importance known as "dynamical importance", which estimates how much $\lambda$ changes when one removes an edge from a graph or adds an edge to it. We examine the accuracy of this estimate for different network structures and compare it to the true change in $\lambda$ after an edge removal or edge addition. We then derive a first-order approximation of the change in the leading eigenvector. We also consider the effects of edge additions on Kuramoto dynamics on networks, and we express the Kuramoto order parameter in terms of dynamical importance. Through our analysis and computational experiments, we find that studying dynamical importance can improve understanding of the relationship between network perturbations and dynamical processes on networks.</description>

      <title>When faster rotation is harmful: the competition of alliances with inner blocking mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competitors in an intransitive loop of dominance can form a defensive alliance against an external species. The vitality of this super-structure, however, is jeopardized if we modify the original rock-scissors-paper-like rule and allow that the vicinity of a predator blocks stochastically the invasion success of its neighboring prey towards a third actor. To explore the potential consequences of this multi-point interaction we introduce a minimal model where two three-member alliances are fighting but one of them suffers from this inner blocking mechanism. We demonstrate that this weakness can be compensated by a faster inner rotation which is in agreement with previous findings. This broadly valid principle, however, is not always true here because the increase of rotation speed could be harmful and results in series of reentrant phase transitions on the parameter plane. This unexpected behavior can be explained by the relation of the blocked triplet and a neutral pair formed by a triplet member with an external species. Our results provide novel aspects to the fundamental laws which determine the evolutionary process in multi-strategy ecological systems.</description>
