      <title>Solitary waves of moderate amplitude in the SSGGN equations: the extended KdV-Whitham approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) equation as a model for long moderately nonlinear surface water waves. In the slow time formulation this equation generates fast propagating resonant radiation due to the non-convexity of its linear dispersion curve, which is not present in the strongly nonlinear Serre-Su-Gardner-Green-Naghdi (SSGGN) parent system. We show that the extended KdV-Whitham approximation and the slow space formulation of the eKdV equation are suitable regularisations of the eKdV equation in several cases of interest, and even for moderate amplitudes. Numerical comparisons are made between the SSGGN system and the respective reduced models, where simulations are initiated with an approximate soliton solution of the eKdV equation, constructed by use of Kodama-Fokas-Liu near-identity transformation to the KdV equation.</description>

      <title>Dam breaks in the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we study the nucleation of Dispersive shock waves (DSW) in the {defocusing}, discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation (DNLS), a model of wide relevance to nonlinear optics and atomic condensates. Here, we study the dynamics of so-called dam break problems with step-initial data characterized by two-parameters, one of which corresponds to the lattice spacing, while the other being the right hydrodynamic background. Our analysis bridges the anti-continuum limit of vanishing coupling strength with the well-established continuum integrable one. To shed light on the transition between the extreme limits, we theoretically deploy Whitham modulation theory, various quasi-continuum asymptotic reductions of the DNLS and existence and stability analysis and connect our findings with systematic numerical computations. Our work unveils a sharp threshold in the discretization across which qualitatively continuum dynamics from the dam breaks are observed. Furthermore, we observe a rich multitude of wave patterns in the small coupling limit including unsteady (and stationary) Whitham shocks, traveling DSWs, discrete NLS kinks and dark solitary waves, among others. Besides, we uncover the phenomena of DSW breakdown and the subsequent formation of multi-phase wavetrains, due to generalized modulational instability of \textit{two-phase} wavetrains. We envision this work as a starting point towards a deeper dive into the apparently rich DSW phenomenology in a wide class of DNLS models across different dimensions and for different nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Exact BPS double-kinks in generalized $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$ and sine-Gordon models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a $(1+1)$-dimensional theory with a single real scalar field $\phi$ whose kinematics is modified by a generalizing function $f(\phi)$. After briefly reviewing its Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) structure, we focus on a particular $f(\phi)$ to obtain analytic BPS double-kink solutions in three different models governed by the $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$, and sine-Gordon superpotentials. In all cases, the resulting double-kinks approach the boundaries by following an exponential decay, with the generalizing function controlling its dependence on $x$ and mass. We also calculate the BPS bound explicitly and study how the double kinks behave near the origin. The energy distribution of the novel BPS states engenders symmetric two-lump profiles for the $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon superpotentials. Whereas, for the $\phi^6$ superpotential, the BPS energy profiles form asymmetric two-lumps.</description>
