      <title>Generalizing Hamiltonian Mechanics with Closed Differential Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Hamiltonian mechanics, characterized by a single conserved Hamiltonian (energy) and symplectic geometry, `hides' other invariants into symmetries of the Hamiltonian or into the kernel of the Poisson tensor. Nambu mechanics aims to generalize classical Hamiltonian mechanics to ideal dynamical systems bearing two Hamiltonians, but its connection to a suitable geometric framework has remained elusive. This work establishes a novel correspondence between generalized Hamiltonian mechanics, defined for systems with a phase space conservation law (invariance of a closed form) and a matter conservation law (invariance of multiple Hamiltonians), and multisymplectic geometry. The key lies in the invertibility of differential forms of degree higher than 2. We demonstrate that the cornerstone theorems of classical Hamiltonian mechanics (Lie-Darboux and Liouville) require reinterpretation within this new framework, reflecting the unique properties of invertibility in multisymplectic geometry. Furthermore, we present two key theorems that solidify the connection: i) any classical Hamiltonian system with two or more invariants is also a generalized Hamiltonian system and ii) given a generalized Hamiltonian system with two or more invariants, there exists a corresponding classical Hamiltonian system on the level set of all but one invariant, with the remaining invariant playing the role of the Hamiltonian function.</description>

      <title>The geometry of sedenion zero divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sedenion algebra $\mathbb S$ is a non-commutative, non-associative, $16$-dimensional real algebra with zero divisors. It is obtained from the octonions through the Cayley-Dickson construction. The zero divisors of $\mathbb S$ can be viewed as the submanifold $\mathcal Z(\mathbb S) \subset \mathbb S \times \mathbb S$ of normalized pairs whose product equals zero, or as the submanifold $\operatorname{\mathit {ZD}}(\mathbb S) \subset \mathbb S$ of normalized elements with non-trivial annihilators. We prove that $\mathcal Z(\mathbb S)$ is isometric to the excepcional Lie group $G_2$, equipped with a naturally reductive left-invariant metric. Moreover, $\mathcal Z(\mathbb S)$ is the total space of a Riemannian submersion over the excepcional symmetric space of quaternion subalgebras of the octonion algebra, with fibers that are locally isometric to a product of two round $3$-spheres with different radii. Additionally, we prove that $\operatorname{\mathit {ZD}}(\mathbb S)$ is isometric to the Stiefel manifold $V_2(\mathbb R^7)$, the space of orthonormal $2$-frames in $\mathbb R^7$, endowed with a specific $G_2$-invariant metric. By shrinking this metric along a circle fibration, we construct new examples of an Einstein metric and a family of homogenous metrics on $V_2(\mathbb R^7)$ with non-negative sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>A curvature flow that deforms curves to an embedded target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the target flow -- a specific curve shortening flow with an ambient forcing term -- that, given an embedded (not necessarily convex) target curve, will attempt to evolve a given source curve to that target. The motivation for this flow is to address a question of Yau. Our main result is that the target flow with uniformly normal graphical data converges smoothly to the target, broadening the class of known sources and targets such that Yau's problem has a solution.</description>

      <title>The Fefferman metric for twistor CR manifolds and conformal geodesics in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit description of the Fefferman metric for twistor CR manifolds in terms of Riemannian structures on the base conformal $3$-manifolds. As an application, we prove that chains and null chains on twistor CR manifolds project to conformal geodesics, and that any conformal geodesic has lifts both to a chain and a null chain. By using this correspondence, we give a variational characterization of conformal geodesics in dimension three which involves the total torsion functional.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lorentz surfaces and s-embeddings II: maximal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S-embeddings were introduced by Chelkak as a tool to study the conformal invariance of the thermodynamic limit of the Ising model. Moreover, Chelkak, Laslier and Russkikh introduced a lift of s-embeddings to Lorentz space, and showed that in the limit the lift converges to a maximal surface. They posed the question whether there are s-embeddings that lift to maximal surfaces already at the discrete level, before taking the limit. We answer this question in the positive. In a previous paper we identified a subclass of s-embeddings--isothermic s-embeddings--that lift to (discrete) S-isothermic surfaces, which were introduced by Bobenko and Pinkall as a discretization of isothermic surfaces. In this paper we identify a special class of isothermic s-embeddings that correspond to discrete S-maximal surfaces, translating an approach of Bobenko, Hoffmann and Springborn introduced for discrete S-minimal surfaces in Euclidean space. Additionally, each S-maximal surface comes with a 1-parameter family of associated surfaces that are isometric. This enables us to obtain an associated family of s-embeddings for each maximal s-embedding. We show that the Ising weights are constant in the associated family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an infinite-dimensional family of solutions for the Yang-Mills flow on $\mathbb{R}^n \times SO(n)$ for $5 \leq n \leq 9$, which converge to $SO(n)$-equivariant homothetically shrinking solitons, modulo the gauge group. As a corollary, we prove the existence of asymmetric Type-I blowup solutions for the Yang-Mills flow.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Frenet theory of curves in dual space $\d^3$. After defining the curvature and the torsion of a curve, we classify all curves in dual plane with constant curvature. We also establish the fundamental theorem of existence in the theory of dual curves, proving that there is a dual curve with prescribed curvature and torsion. Finally we classify all dual curves with constant curvature and torsion.</description>

      <title>On intrinsic rotational surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacelike intrinsic rotational surfaces with constant mean curvature in the Lorentz-Minkowski space $\E_1^3$ have been recently investigated by Brander et al., extending the known Smyth's surfaces in Euclidean space. Assuming that the surface is intrinsic rotational with coordinates $(u,v)$ and conformal factor $\rho(u)^2$, we replace the constancy of the mean curvature with the property that the Weingarten endomorphism $A$ can be expressed as $\Phi_{-\alpha(v)}\left(\begin{array}{ll}\lambda_1(u)&amp;0\\ 0&amp;\lambda_2(u)\end{array}\right)\Phi_{\alpha(v)}$, where $\Phi_{\alpha(v)}$ is the (Euclidean or hyperbolic) rotation of angle $\alpha(v)$ at each tangent plane and $\lambda_i$ are the principal curvatures. Under these conditions, it is proved that the mean curvature is constant and $\alpha$ is a linear function. This result also covers the case that the surface is timelike. If the mean curvature is zero, we determine all spacelike and timelike intrinsic rotational surfaces with rotational angle $\alpha$. This family of surfaces includes the spacelike and timelike Enneper surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the curvature and the torsion of a regular curve of the space forms $\h^3$ and $\s^3$ to be contained in a totally umbilical surface. In case that the curve has constant torsion, we obtain the value of the curvature of the curve. Also numerical pictures of these curves are shown.</description>

Abstract: We provide a generalization of global hyperbolicity in pseudo-Riemannian spaces of signature $(p, q)$ for $p \ge q \ge 2$. We then prove the compactness of causal diamonds in globally hyperbolic spaces and deduce the existence of solutions to a Plateau problem for this class of spaces. Finally, we describe the topology of globally hyperbolic spaces in a result generalising Geroch's splitting theorem.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Gauges and Regularity for Stationary Weak Yang$-$Mills Connections in Supercritical Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that stationary Yang$-$Mills fields in dimensions 5 belonging to the variational class of weak connections are smooth away from a closed singular set $S$ of vanishing 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Our proof is based on an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem, which generalizes to this class of weak connections the existing previous $\varepsilon$-regularity results by G. Tian for smooth connections, by Y. Meyer and the second author for Sobolev and approximable connections, and by T. Tao and G. Tian for admissible connections (which are weak limits of smooth Yang$-$Mills fields). On the path towards establishing $\varepsilon$-regularity, a pivotal step is the construction of controlled Coulomb gauges for general weak connections under small Morrey norm assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Riemannian metrics on 2-surfaces with integrable geodesic flows such that an additional first integral is high-degree polynomial in momenta. This problem reduces to searching for solutions to certain quasi-linear systems of PDEs which turn out to be semi-Hamiltonian. We construct plenty of local explicit and implicit integrable examples with polynomial first integrals of degrees 3, 4, 5. Our construction is essentially based on applying the generalized hodograph method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting points on or near the boundary of a dataset sampled, potentially with noise, from a compact manifold with boundary. We extend recent advances in doubly stochastic scaling of the Gaussian heat kernel via Sinkhorn iterations to this setting. Our main contributions are: (a) deriving a characterization of the scaling factors for manifolds with boundary, (b) developing a boundary direction estimator, aimed at identifying boundary points, based on doubly stochastic kernel and local principal component analysis, and (c) demonstrating through simulations that the resulting estimates of the boundary points outperform the standard Gaussian kernel-based approach, particularly under noisy conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the manifold-valued Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model, which involves an initial datum $f$ mapping from a curved compact surface with smooth boundary to a complete, connected and smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of minimizers under curvature restrictions on the target and topological ones on the range of $f$. We obtain a series of regularity results on the associated PDE system of a relaxed functional with Neumann boundary condition. We apply these results to the ROF model to obtain Lipschitz regularity of minimizers without further requirements on the convexity of the boundary. Additionally, we provide a versions of the regularity statement of independent interest: for 1-dimensional domains (related to signal denoising), local Lipschitz regularity (meaningful for image processing) and Lipschitz regularity for a version of the Mosolov problem coming from fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Curved $\infty$-Local Systems And Projectively Flat Riemann-Hilbert Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence in the presence of scalar curvature for a (possibly non-compact) smooth manifold $M$. We show that the dg-category of curved $\infty$-local systems, the dg-category of graded vector bundles with projectively flat $\mathbb Z$-graded connections and the dg-category of curved representations of the singular simplicial set of the based loop space of $M$ are all $A_\infty$-quasi equivalent. They provide dg-enhancements of the subcategory of the bounded derived category of twisted sheaves whose cohomology sheaves are locally constant and have finite-dimensional fibers. In the ungraded case, we reduce to an equivalence between projectively flat vector bundles and a subcategory of projective representations of $\pi_1(M; x_0)$. As an application of our general framework, we also prove that the category of cohesive modules over the curved Dolbeault algebra of a complex manifold $X$ is equivalent to a subcategory of the bounded derived category of twisted sheaves of $\mathcal O_X$-modules which generalizes a theorem due to Block to possibly non-compact complex manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1708.00887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate solutions of the elliptic sinh-Gordon equation of spectral genus g&lt;3. These solutions are parametrized by complex matrix-valued polynomials called potentials. On the space of these potentials there act two commuting flows. The orbits of these flows are called Polynomial Killing fields and are double periodic. The eigenvalues of these matrix-valued polynomials are preserved along the flows and determine the lattice of periods. We investigate the level sets of these eigenvalues, which are called isospectral sets, and the dependence of the period lattice on the isospectral sets. The limiting cases of spectral genus one and zero are included. Moreover, these limiting cases are used to construct on every elliptic curve three conformal maps to R^4 which are constrained Willmore. Finally, the Willmore functional is calculated in dependence of the conformal class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For semi-Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature, the Calabi operator is a second order linear differential operator that provides local integrability conditions for the range of the Killing operator. In this article, extending earlier results in the Riemannian setting, we identify the Lorentzian locally symmetric spaces on which the Calabi operator is sufficient to identify the range of the Killing operator. Specifically, this is always the case for indecomposable spaces and we identify precisely those products for which it fails. Our method is quite general in that we firstly develop criteria to be in the range of a connection, viewed as a linear differential operator. Then we ascertain how these criteria apply in the case of what we call the Killing connection.</description>

      <title>T-Dualities and Courant Algebroid Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <title>The equivalence of smooth and synthetic notions of timelike sectional curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timelike sectional curvature bounds play an important role in spacetime geometry, both for the understanding of classical smooth spacetimes and for the study of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces introduced in \cite{kunzinger2018lorentzian}. In the smooth setting, a bound on the sectional curvature of timelike planes can be formulated via the Riemann curvature tensor. In the synthetic setting, bounds are formulated by comparing various geometric configurations to the corresponding ones in constant curvature spaces. The first link between these notions in the Lorentzian context was established in \cite{harris1982triangle}, which was instrumental in the proof of powerful results in spacetime geometry \cite{beem1985toponogov, beem1985decomposition, galloway2018existence}. For general semi-Riemannian manifolds, the equivalence between sectional curvature bounds and synthetic bounds was established in \cite{alexander2008triangle}, however in this approach the sectional curvatures of both timelike and spacelike planes have to be considered. In this article, we fill a gap in the literature by proving the full equivalence between sectional curvature bounds on timelike planes and synthetic timelike bounds on strongly causal spacetimes. As an essential tool, we establish Hessian comparison for the time separation and signed distance functions.</description>

      <title>Double extension of flat pseudo-Riemannian $F$-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the concept of a flat pseudo-Riemannian $F$-Lie algebra and construct its corresponding double extension. This algebraic structure can be interpreted as the infinitesimal analogue of a Frobenius Lie group devoid of Euler vector fields. We show that the double extension provides a framework for generating all weakly flat Lorentzian non-abelian bi-nilpotent $F$-Lie algebras possessing one dimensional light-cone subspaces. A similar result can be established for nilpotent Lie algebras equipped with flat scalar products of signature $(2,n-2)$ where $n\geq 4$. Furthermore, we use this technique to construct Poisson algebras exhibiting compatibility with flat scalar products.</description>

      <title>On Relative Tractor Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article contributes to the relative BGG-machinery for parabolic geometries. Starting from a relative tractor bundle, this machinery constructs a sequence of differential operators that are naturally associated to the geometry in question. In many situations of interest, it is known that this sequence provides a resolution of a sheaf that can locally be realized as a pullback from a local leaf space of a foliation that is naturally available in this situation. An explicit description of the latter sheaf was only available under much more restrictive assumptions. For any geometry which admits relative tractor bundles, we construct a large family of such bundles for which we obtain a simple, explicit description of the resolved sheaves under weak assumptions on the torsion of the geometry. In particular, we discuss the cases of Legendrean contact structures and of generalized path geometries, which are among the most important examples for which the relative BGG machinery is available. In both cases, we show that essentially all relative tractor bundles are obtained by our construction and our description of the resolved sheaves applies whenever the BGG sequence is a resolution.</description>

Abstract: We generalise results about isometric group actions on metric spaces and their fundamental regions to the context of merely continuous group actions. In particular, we obtain results that yield the relative compactness of a fundamental region for a cocompact group action. As a consequence, we obtain a criterion for a cocompact cyclic group of semi-Riemannian homotheties to be inessential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exceptional algebroids in the context of warped compactifications of type IIA string theory down to $n$ dimensions, with $n\le 6$. In contrast to the M-theory and type IIB case, the relevant algebroids are no longer exact, and their locali moduli space is no longer trivial, but has $5$ distinct points. This relates to two possible scalar deformations of the IIA theory. The proof of the local classification shows that, in addition to these scalar deformations, one can twist the bracket using a pair of $1$-forms, a $2$-form, a $3$-form, and a $4$-form. Furthermore, we use the analysis to translate the classification of Leibniz parallelisable spaces (corresponding to maximally supersymmetric consistent truncations) into a tractable algebraic problem. We finish with a discussion of the Poisson-Lie U-duality and examples given by tori and spheres in $2$, $3$, and $4$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hawking-type singularity theorems for worldvolume energy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical singularity theorems of R. Penrose and S. Hawking from the 1960s show that, given a pointwise energy condition (and some causality as well as initial assumptions), spacetimes cannot be geodesically complete. Despite their great success, the theorems leave room for physically relevant improvements, especially regarding the classical energy conditions as essentially any quantum field theory necessarily violates them. While singularity theorems with weakened energy conditions exist for worldline integral bounds, so called worldvolume bounds are in some cases more applicable than the worldline ones, such as the case of some massive free fields. In this paper we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a - potentially very negative - global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking type singularity theorem is proven. Finally, we apply the theorem to a cosmological scenario proving past geodesic incompleteness in cases where the worldline theorem was inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Y-algebroids and $E_{7(7)} \times \mathbb{R}^+$-generalised geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of Y-algebroids, generalising the Lie, Courant, and exceptional algebroids that have been used to capture the local symmetry structure of type II string theory and M-theory compactifications to $D \geq 5$ dimensions. Instead of an invariant inner product, or its generalisation arising in exceptional algebroids, Y-algebroids are built around a specific type of tensor, denoted $Y$, that provides exactly the necessary properties to also describe compactifications to $D=4$ dimensions. We classify "M-exact" $E_7$-algebroids and show that this precisely matches the form of the generalised tangent space of $E_{7(7)} \times \mathbb{R}^+$-generalised geometry, with possible twists due to 1-, 4- and 7-form fluxes, corresponding physically to the derivative of the warp factor and the M-theory fluxes. We translate the notion of generalised Leibniz parallelisable spaces, relevant to consistent truncations, into this language, where they are mapped to so-called exceptional Manin pairs. We also show how to understand Poisson-Lie U-duality and exceptional complex structures using Y-algebroids.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Exact Arbitrarily Differentiable de Sitter Cores with Kerr Exteriors: Possible gravastar or regular black hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the paradigm of non-perturbative Einstein gravity we study continuous curvature manifolds which possess de Sitter interiors and Kerr exteriors. These manifolds could represent the spacetime of rotating gravastars or other similar black hole mimickers. The scheme presented here allows for a $C^{n}$ metric transition from the exactly de Sitter interior to the exactly Kerr exterior, with $n$ arbitrarily large. Generic properties that such models must possess are discussed, such as the changing of the topology of the ergosphere from $S^{2}$ to $S^{1}\times S^{1}$. It is shown how in the outer layers of the transition region (the ``atmosphere'' as it is often called in astrophysics) the dominant/weak and strong energy conditions can be respected. However, much like in the case of its static spherically symmetric gravastar counterpart, there must be some assumptions imposed in the atmosphere for the energy conditions to hold. These assumptions turn out to not be severe. The class of manifolds presented here are expected to possess all the salient features of the fully generic case. Strictly speaking, a number of the results are also applicable to the locally anti-de Sitter core scenario, although we focus on the case of a positive cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Loop soup representation of zeta-regularised determinants and equivariant Symanzik identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic representation for determinants of Laplace-type operators on vectors bundles over manifolds. Namely, inverse powers of those determinants are written as the expectation of a product of holonomies defined over Brownian loop soups. Our results hold over compact manifolds of dimension 2 or 3, in the presence of a mass or a boundary. We derive a few consequences, including some continuity of these determinants as a function of the operator, and the conformal invariance of the determinant on surfaces.
  This expression allows us to construct the scalar field minimally coupled to a prescribed random smooth gauge field, which we prove obeys the so-called Symanzik identities. Some of these results are continuous analogues of the work of A. Kassel and T. L\'evy in the discrete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to isoperimetric and geometric inequalities. The main challenge is the treatment of boundary terms. We address this by using an elliptic PDE with an oblique boundary condition. We apply our geometric formulation of Stein's method to obtain stability of the Brock-Weinstock inequality, stability of the isoperimetric inequality under a constraint on Steklov's first non-zero eigenvalue, and stability for the combination of weighted and unweighted perimeters. All stability results are formulated with respect to the $\alpha$-Zolotarev distance, $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1], that we introduce to interpolate between the Fraenkel asymmetry and the Kantorovich distance.</description>
