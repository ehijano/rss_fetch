      <title>Uniform Lyndon interpolation for the pure logic of necessitation with a modal reduction principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the uniform Lyndon interpolation property (ULIP) of some extensions of the pure logic of necessitation $\mathbf{N}$. For any $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ is the logic obtained from $\mathbf{N}$ by adding a single axiom $\Box^n \varphi \to \Box^m \varphi$, which is a $\Diamond$-free modal reduction principle, and a rule $\frac{\neg \Box \varphi}{\neg \Box \Box \varphi}$, which is required to make the logic complete with respect to its Kripke-like semantics. We first introduce a sequent calculus $\mathbf{GN}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ for $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ and show that it enjoys cut elimination, proving Craig and Lyndon interpolation properties as a consequence. We then construct an embedding of $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ into classical propositional logic $\mathbf{Cl}$, which is then used to prove ULIP of $\mathbf{N}^+\mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ by reducing it to that of $\mathbf{Cl}$. We also prove ULIP of $\mathbf{NRA}_{m,n} = \mathbf{N} + \Box^n \varphi \to \Box^m \varphi + \frac{\neg \varphi}{\neg \Box \varphi}$ with a similar method.</description>

      <title>Projective curves and weak second-order logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic zero, we study the incidence relation between points and irreducible projective curves, or more precisely the poset of irreducible proper subvarieties of $\mathbb P^2(K)$. Answering a question of Marcus Tressl, we prove that the poset interprets the field, and it is in fact bi-interpretable with the two-sorted structure consisting of the field $K$ and a sort for its finite subsets. In this structure one can define the integers, so the theory is undecidable. When $K$ is the field of complex numbers we can nevertheless obtain a recursive axiomatization modulo the theory of the integers. We also show that the integers are stably embedded and that the poset of irreducible varieties over the complex numbers is not elementarily equivalent to the one over the algebraic numbers.</description>

      <title>Stability in affine logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop foundational aspects of stability theory in affine logic. On the one hand, we prove appropriate affine versions of many classical results, including definability of types, existence of non-forking extensions, and other fundamental properties of forking calculus. Most notably, stationarity holds over arbitrary sets (in fact, every type is Lascar strong). On the other hand, we prove that stability is preserved under direct integrals of measurable fields of structures. We deduce that stability in the extremal models of an affine theory implies stability of the theory. We also deduce that the affine part of a stable continuous logic theory is affinely stable, generalising the result of preservation of stability under randomisations.</description>

      <title>Cardinal invariants associated with the combinatorics of the uniformity number of the ideal of meager-additive sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [CMRM24], it was proved that it is relatively consistent that \emph{bounding number} $\mathfrak{b}$ is smaller than the uniformity of $\mathcal{MA}$, where $\mathcal{MA}$ denotes the ideal of the meager-additive sets of $2^{\omega}$. To establish this result, a specific cardinal invariant, which we refer to as $\mathfrak{b}_b^\mathsf{eq}$, was introduced in close relation to Bartoszy\'nski's and Judah's characterization of the uniformity of $\mathcal{MA}$. This survey aims to explore this cardinal invariant along with its dual, which we call as $\mathfrak{d}_b^\mathsf{eq}$. In particular, we will illustrate its connections with the cardinals represented in Cicho\'n's diagram. Furthermore, we will present several open problems pertaining to these cardinals.</description>

      <title>A Module-theoretic Introduction to Abstract Elementary Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order model theory of modules has been studied for decades. More recently, the model theoretic study of nonelementary classes of modules--especially Abstract Elementary Classes of modules--has produced interesting results. This survey aims to discuss these recent results and give an introduction to the framework of Abstract Elementary Classes for module theorists.</description>

      <title>Negative resolution to the $C^*$-algebraic Tarski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the $K_1$-group of ultraproducts of unital, simple $C^*$-algebras with unique trace and strict comparison. As an application, we prove that the reduced free group $C^*$-algebras $C^*_r(F_m)$ and $C^*_r(F_n)$ are elementarily equivalent (i.e., have isomorphic ultrapowers) if and only if $m = n$. This settles in the negative the $C^*$-algebraic analogue of Tarski's 1945 problem for groups.</description>

      <title>There are more non-Cantorian sets than are Cantorian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When working in NF, [1] there is a sense that there are more non-Cantorian sets than Cantorian sets. But it is not that immediate result as one expects, since they are externally equinumerous, and the qualification "Cantorian" is not stratified and so not easy to spell internally. This account stipulates a fairly simple criterion to phrase such problems and proves that per that criterion there are more non-Cantorian sets.</description>

      <title>Flipper games for monadically stable graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of graphs $\mathscr{C}$ is monadically stable if for any unary expansion $\widehat{\mathscr{C}}$ of $\mathscr{C}$, one cannot interpret, in first-order logic, arbitrarily long linear orders in graphs from $\widehat{\mathscr{C}}$. It is known that nowhere dense graph classes are monadically stable; these encompass most of the studied concepts of sparsity in graphs, including graph classes that exclude a fixed topological minor. On the other hand, monadic stability is a property expressed in purely model-theoretic terms and hence it is also suited for capturing structure in dense graphs.
  For several years, it has been suspected that one can create a structure theory for monadically stable graph classes that mirrors the theory of nowhere dense graph classes in the dense setting. In this work we provide a step in this direction by giving a characterization of monadic stability through the Flipper game: a game on a graph played by Flipper, who in each round can complement the edge relation between any pair of vertex subsets, and Connector, who in each round localizes the game to a ball of bounded radius. This is an analog of the Splitter game, which characterizes nowhere dense classes of graphs (Grohe, Kreutzer, and Siebertz, J.ACM'17).
  We give two different proofs of our main result. The first proof uses tools from model theory, and it exposes an additional property of monadically stable graph classes that is close in spirit to definability of types. Also, as a byproduct, we give an alternative proof of the recent result of Braunfeld and Laskowski (arXiv 2209.05120) that monadic stability for graph classes coincides with existential monadic stability. The second proof relies on the recently introduced notion of flip-wideness (Dreier, M\"ahlmann, Siebertz, and Toru\'nczyk, ICALP 2023) and provides an efficient algorithm to compute Flipper's moves in a winning strategy.</description>
