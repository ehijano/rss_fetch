      <title>Dynamic Mean-Field Theory for Continuous Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the dynamics of the mean-field approximation of continuous random networks. These networks are stochastic integrodifferential equations driven by Gaussian noise. The kernels in the integral operators are realizations of generalized Gaussian random variables. The equation controls the time evolution of a macroscopic state interpreted as neural activity, which depends on position and time. The position is an element of a measurable space. Such a network corresponds to a statistical field theory (STF) given by a momenta-generating functional. Discrete versions of the mentioned networks appeared in spin glasses and as models of artificial neural networks (NNs). Each of these discrete networks corresponds to a lattice SFT, where the action contains a finite number of neurons and two scalar fields for each neuron. Recently, it has been proposed that these networks can be used as models for deep learning. In this application, the number of neurons is astronomical; consequently, continuous models are required. In this article, we develop mathematically rigorous, continuous versions of the mean-field theory approximation and the double-copy system that allow us to derive a condition for the criticality of continuous stochastic networks via the largest Lyapunov exponent. We use two basic architectures; in the first one, the space of neurons is the real line, and then the neurons are organized in one layer; in the second one, the space of neurons is the p-adic line, and then the neurons are organized in an infinite, fractal, tree-like structure. Networks with both types of architectures exhibit a type edge of the chaos organization.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusive dynamics in photonic random walks probed with classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random walk of photons in a tight-binding lattice is known to exhibit diffusive motion similar to classical random walks under decoherence, clearly illustrating the quantum-to-classical transition. In this study, we reveal that the random walk of intense classical light under dephasing dynamics can disentangle quantum and ensemble averaging, making it possible to observe a subdiffusive walker dynamics, i.e. a behavior very distinct from both a classical and a quantum walker. These findings are demonstrated through proposing photonic random walks in synthetic temporal lattices, based on pulse dynamics in coupled fiber loops.</description>

      <title>Fragility of Chess positions: measure, universality and tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric to quantify the fragility of chess positions using the interaction graph of pieces. This fragility score $F$ captures the tension within a position and serves as a strong indicator of tipping points in a game. In well-known games, maximum fragility often aligns with decisive moments marked by brilliant moves. Analyzing a large dataset of games, we find that fragility typically peaks around move $15$, with pawns ($\approx 60\%$) and knights ($\approx 20\%$) frequently involved in high-tension positions. Remarkably, average fragility curves show a universal pattern across a wide range of players, games, and openings, with a subtle deviation observed in games played by the engine Stockfish. Our analysis reveals a gradual buildup of fragility starting around $8$ moves before the peak, followed by a prolonged fragile state lasting up to $15$ moves. This suggests a gradual intensification of positional tension leading to decisive moments in the game. These insights offer a valuable tool for both players and engines to assess critical moments in chess.</description>

      <title>Large Orders and Strong-Coupling Limit in Functional Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large-order behavior of the functional renormalization group (FRG). For a model in dimension zero, we establish Borel-summability for a large class of microscopic couplings. Writing the derivatives of FRG as contour integrals, we express the Borel-transform as well as the original series as integrals. Taking the strong-coupling limit in this representation, we show that all short-ranged microscopic disorders flow to the same universal fixed point. Our results are relevant for FRG in disordered elastic systems.</description>

      <title>Competing automorphisms and disordered Floquet codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order (FET) where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study deformed Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution$\unicode{x2014}$the automorphisms "compete". We characterize the effect of this competition on Abelian-anyon FETs, showing how the evolution and loss of logical information are linked to the anyons that are invariant under the automorphisms' transition map or that localize at their boundaries. We present an example microscopic realization of this behavior using disorder in the dynamic automorphism color code. This naturally leads to a description of the space of its FETs, which we characterize by establishing when parameter-space paths connecting distinct FETs can preserve logical information. We also show that transitions between distinct FETs display criticality described by bond percolation. The perspective of competing automorphisms captures essential features of possible FETs and their transitions, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and disorder.</description>

      <title>Generalization emerges from local optimization in a self-organized learning network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design and analyze a new paradigm for building supervised learning networks, driven only by local optimization rules without relying on a global error function. Traditional neural networks with a fixed topology are made up of identical nodes and derive their expressiveness from an appropriate adjustment of connection weights. In contrast, our network stores new knowledge in the nodes accurately and instantaneously, in the form of a lookup table. Only then is some of this information structured and incorporated into the network geometry. The training error is initially zero by construction and remains so throughout the network topology transformation phase. The latter involves a small number of local topological transformations, such as splitting or merging of nodes and adding binary connections between them. The choice of operations to be carried out is only driven by optimization of expressivity at the local scale. What we are primarily looking for in a learning network is its ability to generalize, i.e. its capacity to correctly answer questions for which it has never learned the answers. We show on numerous examples of classification tasks that the networks generated by our algorithm systematically reach such a state of perfect generalization when the number of learned examples becomes sufficiently large. We report on the dynamics of the change of state and show that it is abrupt and has the distinctive characteristics of a first order phase transition, a phenomenon already observed for traditional learning networks and known as grokking. In addition to proposing a non-potential approach for the construction of learning networks, our algorithm makes it possible to rethink the grokking transition in a new light, under which acquisition of training data and topological structuring of data are completely decoupled phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body solver using artificial neural networks and its applications to strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>

      <title>Hebbian Learning from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the original storage prescription for the Hopfield model of neural networks -- as well as for its dense generalizations -- has been turned into a genuine Hebbian learning rule by postulating the expression of its Hamiltonian for both the supervised and unsupervised protocols. In these notes, first, we obtain these explicit expressions by relying upon maximum entropy extremization \`a la Jaynes. Beyond providing a formal derivation of these recipes for Hebbian learning, this construction also highlights how Lagrangian constraints within entropy extremization force network's outcomes on neural correlations: these try to mimic the empirical counterparts hidden in the datasets provided to the network for its training and, the denser the network, the longer the correlations that it is able to capture. Next, we prove that, in the big data limit, whatever the presence of a teacher (or its lacking), not only these Hebbian learning rules converge to the original storage prescription of the Hopfield model but also their related free energies (and, thus, the statistical mechanical picture provided by Amit, Gutfreund and Sompolinsky is fully recovered). As a sideline, we show mathematical equivalence among standard Cost functions (Hamiltonian), preferred in Statistical Mechanical jargon, and quadratic Loss Functions, preferred in Machine Learning terminology. Remarks on the exponential Hopfield model (as the limit of dense networks with diverging density) and semi-supervised protocols are also provided.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in systems with diffusive dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between scrambling and projective measurements can lead to measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIPT). In this work, we show that the universality class of the MIPT is drastically altered when the system is coupled to a diffusing conserved density. Specifically, we consider a 1+1d random Clifford circuit locally monitored by classically diffusing particles (``measurers''). The resulting diffusive correlations in the measurement density are a relevant perturbation to the usual space-time random MIPT critical point, producing a new universality class for this phase transition. We find ``Griffiths-like'' effects due to rare space-time regions where, e.g., the diffusive measurers have a low or high density, but these are considerably weaker than the Griffiths effects that occur with quenched randomness that produce rare spatial regions with infinite lifetime.</description>

      <title>Identifying trivial and Majorana zero-energy modes using the Majorana polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider superconductor-semiconductor hybrids containing both trivial and Majorana zero modes and explore their signatures in the Majorana polarization. In particular, we consider trivial zero energy states due to confinement and disorder, which seem to be very likely experimental scenarios. We show that the Majorana polarization is able to characterize the topological phase transition as well as the emergence of Majorana zero modes even when trivial zero-energy states proliferate. Notably, the Majorana polarization inherits direct information about spatial correlations which are then the key for distinguishing Majorana and trivial zero-modes. We demonstrate the utility of the Majorana polarization in normal-superconductor junctions and superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junctions. Our results support the interpretation of the Majorana polarization as a real space topological indicator.</description>

      <title>Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</description>
