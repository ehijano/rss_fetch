      <title>Doppler-free spectroscopy of the Cs $6\text{S}_{1/2}-7\text{P}_{3/2}$ atomic transition at 456 nm in a nanometric-thick vapor layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The features of Doppler-free resonances detected by probing the $^{133}$Cs atom $6S_{1/2}-7P_{3/2}$ transition at 456 nm in a nanometric-thick vapor layer are investigated. The matrix element of this transition is about 11 times smaller than that of the Cs D$_2$ line (852 nm). When the vapor layer thickness is $\ell = \lambda/2 \simeq 230$ nm, we observe Dicke narrowing of the lines, accompanied by a red frequency shift of the atomic transitions, which is attributed to atom-surface interactions. Realizing optical pumping with $\ell\simeq 460$ nm in a single-pass configuration, we observe Doppler-free resonances with a linewidth $&lt;20$ MHz, located at the atomic transitions frequencies with a correspondence of the amplitudes to the transition intensities. These narrow resonances are of interest for high-resolution spectroscopy and instrumentation, and could serve as a frequency reference.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurements of electric-dipole-transition amplitudes in excited states of $^{208}$Pb using Faraday rotation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have completed measurements of two low-lying excited-state electric-dipole (E1) transition amplitudes in lead. Our measured reduced matrix elements of the $(6s^2 6p^2)^3P_1 \to (6s^2 6p7s)^3P_0$ transition at 368.3 nm and the 405.8 nm $(6s^2 6p^2)^3P_2 \to (6s^2 6p7s)^3P_1$ transition are 1.90(1) a.u. and 3.01(2) a.u. respectively, both measured to sub-1 % precision and both in excellent agreement with the latest $ab \ initio$ lead wavefunction calculations. These measurements were completed by comparing the low-field Faraday optical rotation spectra of each E1 transition in turn with that of the ground-state $^{3}P_0 \to ^{3}P_1$ M1 transition under identical experimental conditions. Our spectroscopy technique involves polarization modulation and lock-in detection yielding microradian-level optical rotation resolution. At temperatures where direct absorption was significant for both E1 and M1 transitions, we also extracted matrix element values from a direct optical absorption depth comparison. As part of this work we designed an interaction region within our furnace which allowed precise determination of our quartz vapor cell sample temperature to provide accurate determination of the Boltzmann thermal population of the low-lying excited states that were studied.</description>

      <title>Cs microcell optical reference at 459 nm with short-term frequency stability below 2 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the short-term frequency stability characterization of external-cavity diode lasers stabilized onto the 6S$_{1/2}$-7P$_{1/2}$ transition of Cs atom at 459 nm, using a microfabricated vapor cell. The laser beatnote between two nearly-identical systems, each using saturated absorption spectroscopy in a simple retroreflected configuration, exhibits an instability of $2.5\times10^{-13}$ at 1 s, consistent with phase noise analysis, and $3\times 10^{-14}$ at 200 s. The primary contributors to the stability budget at one second are the FM-AM noise conversion and the intermodulation effect, both emerging from laser frequency noise. These results highlight the potential of microcell-based optical references to achieve stability performances comparable to that of an active hydrogen maser in a remarkably simple architecture.</description>

      <title>L-shell Photoionisation Cross Sections in the S^{+}, S^{2+}, S^{3+} Isonuclear Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present absolute L-shell photoionisation cross sections for the S+, S2+, S3+ions. The cross sections were obtained using the monochromatised photon beam delivered by the SOLEIL synchrotron source coupled with an ion beam extracted from an electron cyclotron resonance source (ECRIS) in the merged dual-beam configuration. The cross sections for single, double and triple ionisation were measured and combined to generate total photoionisation cross sections. For each of the S+, S2+, S3+ ions, the photon energy regions corresponding to the excitation and ionisation of a 2p or a 2s electron (175-230 eV) were investigated. The experimental results are interpreted with the help of multiconfigurational Dirac-Fock (MCDF) and Breit-Pauli R-Matrix (BPRM) or Dirac R-Matrix (DARC) theoretical calculations. The former generates photoabsorption cross sections from eigenenergies and eigenfunctions obtained by solving variationally the multiconfiguration Dirac Hamiltonian while the latter calculate cross sections for photon scattering by atoms. The cross sectional spectra feature rich resonance structures with narrow natural widths (typically less than 100 meV) due to 2p to nd excitations below and up to the 2p thresholds. This behaviour is consistent with the large number of inner-shell states based on correlation and spin-orbit mixed configurations having three open subshells. Strong and wide (typically 1 eV) Rydberg series of resonances due to 2s to np excitations dominate above the 2p threshold.</description>

      <title>Nebular spectra of kilonovae with detailed recombination rates -- I. Light r-process composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate spectra of kilonovae in the NLTE phase (t &gt;=1week), we perform atomic calculations for dielectronic (DR) and radiative (RR) recombination rates for the light r-process elements: Se (Z = 34), Rb (Z = 37), Sr (Z = 38), Y (Z = 39), and Zr (Z = 40) using the HULLAC code. For the different elements, our results for the total rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 10^{-13}-10^{-9} cm^3/s, 10^{-12}-10^{-10} cm^3/s, and 10^{-13}-10^{-10} cm^3/s, respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. We also provide fits to the ground state photoionization cross sections of the various ions, finding larger and more slowly declining values with energy in comparison to the hydrogenic approximation. Using this new atomic data, we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days using the spectral synthesis code SUMO. Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr (Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r-process compositions. Further, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g. [Se III] 4.55 \mum) and optical (e.g. [Rb I] 7802, 7949 A) lines disappear in the new model. Instead a strong [Se I] line is seen to be emerging at \lambda=5.03 \mum. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.</description>

      <title>Probing topological matter and fermion dynamics on a neutral-atom quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum suppression of cold reactions far from the s-wave energy limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reactions between pairs of atoms are ubiquitous processes in chemistry and physics. Quantum scattering effects on reactions often require extremely ultracold temperatures, approaching the $s$-wave regime, with a small number of partial waves involved. At higher temperatures, the different phases associated with the centrifugal barriers of different partial waves average out quantum interference to yield classical reaction rates. Here, we use quantum-logic to experimentally study resonant charge-exchange reactions between individual cold pairs of neutral $^{87}$Rb atoms and optically-inaccessible $^{87}$Rb$^{+}$ ions far above the $s$-wave regime. We find that the measured charge-exchange rate is significantly suppressed with respect to the classical prediction. Our results indicate that even at temperatures three orders of magnitude higher than the ultracold $s$-wave regime, quantum interference in collisions persists and impacts reaction rates.</description>
