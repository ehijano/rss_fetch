      <title>High dimensional countable compactness and ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define several notions of a limit point on sequences with domain a barrier in $[\omega]^{&lt;\omega}$ focusing on the two dimensional case $[\omega]^2$. By exploring some natural candidates, we show that countable compactness has a number of generalizations in terms of limits of high dimensional sequences and define a particular notion of $\alpha$-countable compactness for $\alpha\leq\omega_1$. We then focus on dimension 2 and compare 2-countable compactness with notions previously studied in the literature. We present a number of counterexamples showing that these classes are different. In particular assuming the existence of a Ramsey ultrafilter, a subspace of $\beta\omega$ which is doubly countably compact whose square is not countably compact, answering a question of T. Banakh, S. Dimitrova and O. Gutik. The analysis of this construction leads to some possibly new types of ultrafilters related to discrete, P-points and Ramsey ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>Representations of domains via closure spaces in the quantale-valued setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a commutative unital quantale $L$ as the truth value table, this study focuses on the representations of $L$-domains by means of $L$-closure spaces. First, the notions of interpolative generalized $L$-closure spaces and directed closed sets are introduced. It is proved that in an interpolative generalized $L$-closure space (resp., $L$-closure space), the collection of directed closed sets with respect to the inclusion $L$-order forms a continuous $L$-dcpo (resp., an algebraic $L$-dcpo). Conversely, it is shown that every continuous $L$-dcpo (resp., algebraic $L$-dcpo) can be reconstructed by an interpolative generalized $L$-closure space (resp., $L$-closure space). Second, when $L$ is integral, the notion of dense subspaces of generalized $L$-closure spaces is introduced. By means of dense subspaces, an alternative representation for algebraic $L$-dcpos is given. Moreover, the concept of $L$-approximable relations between interpolative generalized $L$-closure spaces is introduced. Consequently, a categorical equivalence between the category of interpolative generalized $L$-closure spaces (resp., $L$-closure spaces) with $L$-approximable relations and that of continuous $L$-dcpos (resp., algebraic $L$-dcpos) with Scott continuous mappings is established.</description>

      <title>Open filters and measurable cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the poset $\mathbf{OF}(X)$ of free open filters on a given space $X$. In particular, we characterize spaces for which $\mathbf{OF}(X)$ is a lattice. For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we construct a scattered space $X$ such that $\mathbf{OF}(X)$ is order isomorphic to the $n$-element chain, which implies the affirmative answer to two questions of Mooney. Assuming CH we construct a scattered space $X$ such that $\mathbf{OF}(X)$ is order isomorphic to $(\omega+1,\geq)$. To prove the latter facts we introduce and investigate a new stratification of ultrafilters which depends on scattered subspaces of $\beta(\kappa)$. Assuming the existence of $n$ measurable cardinals, for every $m_0,\ldots,m_{n}\in\mathbb N$ we construct a space $X$ such that $\mathbf{OF}(X)$ is order isomorphic to $\prod_{i=0}^nm_i$. Also, we show that the existence of a metric space possessing a free $\omega_1$-complete closed, $G_\delta$, $F_{\sigma}$ or Borel ultrafilter is equivalent to the existence of a measurable cardinal.</description>
