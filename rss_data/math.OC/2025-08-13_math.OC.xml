      <title>Optimal Transport on Lie Group Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In its most general form, the optimal transport problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, yet certain notable instances admit closed-form solutions. We identify the common source of this tractability as symmetry and formalize it using Lie group theory. Fixing a Lie group action on the outcome space and a reference distribution, we study optimal transport between measures lying on the same Lie group orbit of the reference distribution. In this setting, the Monge problem admits an explicit upper bound given by an optimization over the stabilizer subgroup of the reference distribution. The reduced problem's dimension scales with that of the stabilizing subgroup and, in the tractable cases we study, is either zero or finite. Under mild regularity conditions, a simple algebraic certificate, verified at an optimizer of the reduced problem, ensures tightness of the upper bound for both the Monge and Kantorovich formulations, with the optimal map realized by a single group element. This orbit-based viewpoint unifies known closed-form solutions, such as those for one-dimensional and elliptical distributions, and yields a new one for optimal transport between Wishart distributions.</description>

      <title>Tightening the mixed integer linear formulation for the piecewise linear approximation in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tightening the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) approximations of data sets in arbitrary dimensions. The MILP formulation leverages the difference-of-convex (DC) representation of CPWL functions. We introduce the concept of well-behaved CPWL interpolations and demonstrate that any CPWL interpolation of a data set has a well-behaved version. This result is critical to tighten the MILP problem. We present six different strategies to tighten the problem, which include fixing the values of some variables, introducing additional constraints, identifying small big-M parameter values and applying tighter variable bounds. These methods leverage key aspects of the DC representation and the inherent structure of well-behaved CPWL interpolations. Experimental results demonstrate that specific combinations of these tightening strategies lead to significant improvement in solution times, especially for tightening strategies that consider well-behaved CPWL solutions.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Stochastic Convex-Concave Optimization: Dynamic Regret Analyses under Single and Multiple Consensus Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed online convex-concave optimization with constraint sets over a multiagent network, in which each agent autonomously generates a series of decision pairs through a designable mechanism to cooperatively minimize the global loss function. To this end, under no-Euclidean distance metrics, we propose a distributed online stochastic mirror descent convex-concave optimization algorithm with time-varying predictive mappings. Taking dynamic saddle point regret as a performance metric, it is proved that the proposed algorithm achieves the regret upper-bound in $\mathcal{O}(\max \{T^{\theta_1}, T^{\theta_2} (1+V_T ) \})$ for the general convex-concave loss function, where $\theta_1, \theta_2 \in(0,1)$ are the tuning parameters, $T$ is the total iteration time, and $V_T$ is the path-variation. Surely, this algorithm guarantees the sublinear convergence, provided that $V_T$ is sublinear. Moreover, aiming to achieve better convergence, we further investigate a variant of this algorithm by employing the multiple consensus technique. The obtained results show that the appropriate setting can effectively tighten the regret bound to a certain extent. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed algorithms is validated and compared through the simulation example of a target tracking problem.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete multi-to -one dimensional variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of semi-discrete variational problems that arise in economic matching and game theory, where agents with continuous attributes are matched to a finite set of outcomes with a one dimensional structure. Such problems appear in applications including Cournot-Nash equilibria, and hedonic pricing, and can be formulated as problems involving optimal transport between spaces of unequal dimensions. In our discrete strategy space setting, we establish analogues of results developed for a continuum of strategies in \cite{nenna2020variational}, ensuring solutions have a particularly simple structure under certain conditions. This has important numerical consequences, as it is natural to discretize when numerically computing solutions. We leverage our results to develop efficient algorithms for these problems which scale significantly better than standard optimal transport solvers, particularly when the number of discrete outcomes is large, provided our conditions are satisfied. We also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for these algorithms. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by solving a range of numerical examples; in many of these our new solvers outperform alternatives by a considerable margin.</description>

      <title>Attention's forward pass and Frank-Wolfe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hardmax limit of self-attention dynamics for token embeddings obtained in the zero-temperature ($\beta\to+\infty$) regime, and relate it to the finite-$\beta$ setting. In this limit, the update rule can be viewed as a Frank-Wolfe step for a quadratic objective over the convex hull of the current token embeddings. When the key-query matrix is negative semidefinite, the method linearly contracts all tokens to a single cluster at the origin. When it is positive semidefinite, extending the hardmax rule to the entire convex hull induces a Voronoi diagram: vertices are stationary, interior points remain in their initial cells, and each token moves along a straight line toward its cell's vertex, yielding (super-)exponential convergence. As a byproduct, we also establish well-posedness of the associated ODE limit in this regime. Returning to the finite-$\beta$ regime, we model self-attention dynamics as a Markov chain and prove dynamic metastability: with high probability, interior tokens reach near-vertex configurations in a constant number of steps and remain within a small neighborhood for times that grow exponentially in the inverse temperature $\beta$, before ultimately collapsing to the origin. Thus, the hardmax dynamics accurately approximate the finite-$\beta$ process over exponentially long time horizons.</description>

      <title>Detectability via observability in a nonuniform framework: dual relationship with controllability and stabilizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new observability property for nonautonomous linear control systems in finite dimension: the nonuniform complete observability, which is more general than the uniform complete observability. A dual relationship is established between this new notion of observability and the recently defined nonuniform complete controllability property, with the aim of obtaining the main result, which proves that nonuniform complete observability guarantees the nonuniform exponential detectability, a concept related to exponential stability in this framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Solutions for Last-Mile On-Demand Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization, classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions. Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.</description>

      <title>Objective Soups: Multilingual Multi-Task Modeling for Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training a single model for multilingual, multi-task speech processing (MSP) is severely hampered by conflicting objectives between tasks like speech recognition and translation. While multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to align gradient updates, its effectiveness diminishes as the number of tasks grows, making it difficult to find a common descent direction. This raises a fundamental question: should highly conflicting objectives be optimized jointly or separated into a hierarchical structure? To address this question, this paper investigates three multi-objective MSP formulations, which we refer to as \textbf{objective soup recipes}. These formulations apply multi-objective optimization at different optimization levels to mitigate potential conflicts among all objectives. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a lightweight layer-selection mechanism that computes the conflict-avoiding gradient using only the most problematic layers, minimizing computational and memory overhead. Extensive experiments on CoVoST v2, LibriSpeech, and AISHELL-1 reveal that a bi-level recipe separating recognition and translation tasks consistently outperforms standard flat optimization. Our work demonstrates that hierarchical MOO is a more effective and scalable approach for building state-of-the-art MSP models.

      <title>Carbon Pricing in Traffic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we study how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that respect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general multi-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These externalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the traversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes.
  We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as Wardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More precisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible flow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting appropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there are prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of existence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are non-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a convex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a suitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the total externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For increasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a single externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all equilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are networks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that the minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time. This allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit schemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under mild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in traffic networks.</description>

      <title>Canonical Frames for Bracket Generating Rank 2 Distributions which are not Goursat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete a uniform construction of canonical absolute parallelism for bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube on $n$-dimensional manifold with $n\geq 5$ by showing that the condition of maximality of class that was assumed previously by Doubrov-Zelenko for such a construction holds automatically at generic points. This also gives analogous constructions in the case when the cube is not $5$-dimensional but the distribution is not Goursat through the procedure of iterative Cartan deprolongation. This together with the classical theory of Goursat distributions covers in principle the local geometry of all bracket generating rank 2 distributions in a neighborhood of generic points. As a byproduct, for any $n\geq 5$ we describe the maximally symmetric germs among bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube, as well as among those which reduce to such a distribution under a fixed number of Cartan deprolongations. Another consequence of our results on maximality of class is for optimal control problems with constraint given by a rank $2$ distribution with $5$-dimensional cube: it implies that for a generic point $q_0$ of $M$, there are plenty abnormal extremal trajectories of corank $1$ (which is the minimal possible corank) starting at $q_0$. The set of such points contains all points where the distribution is equiregular.</description>

      <title>A pseudo-inverse of a line graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line graphs are an alternative representation of graphs where each vertex of the original (root) graph becomes an edge. However not all graphs have a corresponding root graph, hence the transformation from graphs to line graphs is not invertible. We investigate the case when there is a small perturbation in the space of line graphs, and try to recover the corresponding root graph, essentially defining the inverse of the line graph operation. We propose a linear integer program that edits the smallest number of edges in the line graph, that allow a root graph to be found. We use the spectral norm to theoretically prove that such a pseudo-inverse operation is well behaved. Illustrative empirical experiments on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our theoretical results work in practice.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Topology Optimisation of Time-dependent Thermal Conduction Using Space-Time Finite Elements and a Parallel Space-Time Multigrid Preconditioner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel space-time topology optimisation framework for time-dependent thermal conduction problems, aiming to significantly reduce the time-to-solution. By treating time as an additional spatial dimension, we discretise the governing equations using a stabilised continuous Galerkin space-time finite element method. The resulting large all-at-once system is solved using an iterative Krylov solver preconditioned with a parallel space-time multigrid method employing a semi-coarsening strategy. Implemented in a fully parallel computing framework, the method yields a parallel-in-time method that demonstrates excellent scalability on a distributed-memory supercomputer, solving problems up to 4.2 billion degrees of freedom. Comparative studies show up to 52x speed-up over traditional time-stepping approaches, with only moderate increases in total computational cost in terms of core-hours. The framework is validated on benchmark problems with both time-constant and time-varying designs, and its flexibility is demonstrated through variations in material properties. These results establish the proposed space-time method as a promising approach for large-scale time-dependent topology optimisation in thermal applications.</description>

      <title>Temporal Anchoring in Deepening Embedding Spaces: Event-Indexed Projections, Drift, Convergence, and an Internal Computational Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for temporal anchoring in embedding spaces, modeled as drift maps interleaved with event-indexed blocks culminating in affine projections. We provide complete proofs for a variable-block contraction lemma (products of Lipschitz factors), a drift--projection convergence theorem with explicit uniform-gap envelopes, and ontological convergence under nested affine anchors with a robustness variant. We formalize an internal Manuscript Computer (MC) whose computations are defined purely by these operators and prove a rigorous finite-run equivalence theorem (with perturbation bounds). For attention layers, we give a self-contained proof that softmax is $1/2$-Lipschitz in $\ell_2$ and derive sufficient layer-contraction conditions (orthogonal/non-orthogonal heads). All floats are placed exactly where written; the manuscript uses only in-paper pseudocode and appendix figures.</description>

      <title>Collision-Free Bearing-Driven Formation Tracking for Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of tracking formations driven by bearings for heterogeneous Euler-Lagrange systems with parametric uncertainty in the presence of multiple moving leaders. To estimate the leaders' velocities and accelerations, we first design a distributed observer for the leader system, utilizing a bearing-based localization condition in place of the conventional connectivity assumption. This observer, coupled with an adaptive mechanism, enables the synthesis of a novel distributed control law that guides the formation towards the target formation, without requiring prior knowledge of the system parameters. Furthermore, we establish a sufficient condition, dependent on the initial formation configuration, that ensures collision avoidance throughout the formation evolution. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a numerical example.</description>

Abstract: Over the years, computational imaging with accurate nonlinear physical models has garnered considerable interest due to its ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions. However, using such nonlinear models for reconstruction is computationally demanding. A popular choice for solving the corresponding inverse problems is the accelerated stochastic proximal method (ASPM), with the caveat that each iteration is still expensive. To overcome this issue, we propose a mini-batch quasi-Newton proximal method (BQNPM) tailored to image reconstruction problems with constrained total variation regularization. Compared to ASPM, BQNPM requires fewer iterations to converge. Moreover, we propose an efficient approach to compute a weighted proximal mapping at a cost similar to that of the proximal mapping in ASPM. We also analyze the convergence of BQNPM in the nonconvex setting. We assess the performance of BQNPM on three-dimensional inverse-scattering problems with linear and nonlinear physical models. Our results on simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BQNPM, while also validating our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time q-Learning for Jump-Diffusion Models under Tsallis Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time reinforcement learning in jump-diffusion models by featuring the q-learning (the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning) under Tsallis entropy regularization. Contrary to the Shannon entropy, the general form of Tsallis entropy renders the optimal policy not necessarily a Gibbs measure. Herein, the Lagrange multiplier and KKT condition are needed to ensure that the learned policy is a probability density function. As a consequence, the characterization of the optimal policy using the q-function also involves a Lagrange multiplier. In response, we establish the martingale characterization of the q-function and devise two q-learning algorithms depending on whether the Lagrange multiplier can be derived explicitly or not. In the latter case, we consider different parameterizations of the optimal q-function and the optimal policy, and update them alternatively in an Actor-Critic manner. We also study two numerical examples, namely, an optimal liquidation problem in dark pools and a non-LQ control problem. It is interesting to see therein that the optimal policies under the Tsallis entropy regularization can be characterized explicitly, which are distributions concentrated on some compact support. The satisfactory performance of our q-learning algorithms is illustrated in each example.</description>

      <title>The Holonomy of Optimal Mass Transport: The Gaussian-Linear Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) has in recent years spurred a fast developing phase of research in stochastic control, control of ensemble systems, thermodynamics, data science, and several other fields in engineering and science. We herein introduce a new type of transportation problems. The salient feature of these problems is that particles/agents in the ensemble are labeled and their relative position along their journey is of interest. Of particular importance in our program are control laws that steer ensembles along cycles ensuring that individual particles return to their original position. This feature is in contrast with the classical theory of optimal transport where the primary object of study is the path of probability densities, without any concern about particle labels. In the theory that we present, we focus on the case Gaussian distributions and linear dynamics, and explore a hitherto unstudied sub-Riemannian structure of Monge-Kantorovich transport where the relative position of particles along their journey is modeled by the holonomy of the transportation schedule. From this vantage point, we discuss several other problems of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multi-Objective Optimization for Integrated Unit Commitment and Investment Planning for District Heating Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need to decarbonize the energy system has intensified the focus on district heating networks in urban and suburban areas. Therefore, exploring transformation pathways with reasonable trade-offs between economic viability and environmental goals became necessary. We introduce a network-flow-based model class integrating unit commitment and long-term investment planning for multi-energy systems. While the integration of unit commitment and investment planning has been applied to multi-energy systems, a formal introduction and suitability for the application of long-term portfolio planning of an energy provider on an urban scale has yet to be met. Based on mixed integer linear programming, the model bridges the gap between overly detailed industrial modeling tools not designed for computational efficiency at scale and rather abstract academic models. The formulation is tested on Berlin's district heating network. Hence, the challenge lies in a large number of variables and constraints and the coupling of time steps, for example, through investment decisions. A case study explores different solutions on the Pareto front defined by optimal trade-offs between minimizing costs and CO2 emissions through a lexicographic optimization approach. The resulting solution catalog can provide decision-makers valuable insights into feasible transformation pathways, highlighting distinctions between robust and target-dependent investments.</description>

      <title>Sparse Tensor CCA via Manifold Optimization for Multi-View Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor canonical correlation analysis (TCCA) has garnered significant attention due to its effectiveness in capturing high-order correlations in multi-view learning. However, existing TCCA methods often fail to characterize the structure of individual views and lack algorithmic convergence guarantees. In order to deal with these challenges, we propose a novel sparse TCCA model called STCCA-L, which integrates sparse regularization of canonical matrices and Laplacian regularization of multi-order graphs into the TCCA framework, thereby effectively exploiting the geometric structure of individual views. To solve this non-convex model, we develop an efficient alternating manifold proximal gradient algorithm via manifold optimization, which avoids computationally expensive full tensor decomposition and leverages a semi-smooth Newton method for subproblem resolution. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm and analyze its complexity. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed method. Notably, on the 3sources dataset, it achieves improvements of at least 4.50\% in accuracy and 6.77\% in F1-score over competitors. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhudafa/STCCA-L.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Fast Operator Splitting Methods for Generalized Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop two variance-reduced fast operator splitting methods to approximate solutions of a class of generalized equations, covering fundamental problems such as \rvs{minimization}, minimax problems, and variational inequalities as special cases. Our approach integrates recent advances in accelerated operator splitting and fixed-point methods, co-hypomonotonicity, and variance reduction. First, we introduce a class of variance-reduced estimators and establish their variance-reduction bounds. This class includes both unbiased and biased instances and comprises common estimators as special cases, including SVRG, SAGA, SARAH, and Hybrid-SGD. Second, we design a novel accelerated variance-reduced forward-backward splitting (FBS) method using these estimators to solve generalized equations in both finite-sum and expectation settings. Our algorithm achieves both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ convergence rates on the expected squared norm $\mathbb{E}[ \| G_{\lambda}x^k\|^2]$ of the FBS residual $G_{\lambda}$, where $k$ is the iteration counter. Additionally, we establish almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the underlying generalized equation. Unlike existing stochastic operator splitting algorithms, our methods accommodate co-hypomonotone operators, which can include nonmonotone problems arising in recent applications. Third, we specify our method for each concrete estimator mentioned above and derive the corresponding oracle complexity, demonstrating that these variants achieve the best-known oracle complexity bounds without requiring additional enhancement techniques. Fourth, we develop a variance-reduced fast backward-forward splitting (BFS) method, which attains similar convergence results and oracle complexity bounds as our FBS-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Model-Based Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithm for Partially Separable Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose UPOQA, a derivative-free optimization algorithm for partially separable unconstrained problems, leveraging quadratic interpolation and a structured trust-region framework. By decomposing the objective into element functions, UPOQA constructs underdetermined element models and solves subproblems efficiently via a modified projected gradient method. Innovations include an approximate projection operator for structured trust regions, improved management of elemental radii and models, a starting point search mechanism, and support for hybrid black-white-box optimization, etc. Numerical experiments on 85 CUTEst problems demonstrate that \texttt{UPOQA} can significantly reduce the number of function evaluations. To quantify the impact of exploiting partial separability, we introduce the speed-up profile to further evaluate the acceleration effect. Results show that the speed-up of UPOQA over baselines is less significant in low-precision scenarios but becomes more pronounced in high-precision scenarios. Applications to quantum variational problems further validate its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Sample-Based Consistency in Infinite-Dimensional Conic-Constrained Stochastic Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a class of stochastic optimization problems defined on a Banach space with almost sure conic-type constraints. For this class of problems, we investigate the consistency of optimal values and solutions corresponding to sample average approximation. Consistency is also shown in the case where a Moreau--Yosida-type regularization of the constraint is used. Additionally, the consistency of Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions is shown under mild conditions. This work provides theoretical justification for the numerical computation of solutions frequently used in the literature. Several applications are explored showing the flexibility of the framework.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of a pH Swing Precipitation Process and its Optimal Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the semi-batch process of precipitation of calcium carbonate solids from a solution containing calcium ions by adjusting the pH of the solution. The change in pH is induced either by the addition of alkaline solution such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or by the addition of a carbon dioxide gas (CO$_2$) to the given ionic solution. Under this setup we propose a system of degenerate stochastic partial differential equations that is able to explain the dynamical behavior of the key components of precipitation process. In particular, we propose a semi-linear advection equation for the dynamics of particle size distribution (PSD) of the precipitated particles. This is in turn coupled with a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that is able to explain the chemical kinetics between calcium ions (Ca$^{+2}$), calcium carbonate (CaCO$_3$) in aqueous state and pH of the solution. The resulting coupled system is first mathematically studied, in particular conditions for the existence of a mild-solution is established and also the long time behavior of the system is established. Following this we consider the validation of the model for which we consider experimentally obtained lab-scale data. Using this data we propose three methods to fit the model with the data which then also validates the suitability of the proposed model. The three methods include manual intuitive tuning, classical forward backward SDE (FBSDE) method and finally a DNN based method. The FBSDE method is based on the stochastic optimal control formulation for which we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal solution. Lastly, we compare the three methods and show that DNN method is the best in terms of lowest error and as the most economical in terms of the compute resources necessary during online use.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control: Non-Penalty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [1], the distributed linear-quadratic problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ) are formulated into a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem with affine constraints. Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in [1], and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization) algorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper, we aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the challenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious stationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the DFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we revisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish its convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When these assumptions do not hold, we show that alternative approaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation methods can be effectively utilized. In summary, our results enable the direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex surrogates, restrictive structural assumptions or penalty formulations that incorporate constraints into the cost function.</description>

      <title>The Design of Optimal Re-Insurance Contracts when Losses are Clustered</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the form of optimal reinsurance contracts in the case of clusters of losses. The underlying insured risk is represented by a marked Hawkes process, where the intensity of the jumps depends not only on the occurrence of previous jumps but also on the size of the jumps, which represents the financial magnitude of the loss. The reinsurance contracts are applied to each loss at the time of occurrence, but their structure is assumed to be constant. We derive closed-form formulas within the meanvariance framework. Additionally, we demonstrate that the optimal contract is not the classical excess-loss (deductible) form. The optimal contract is piecewise linear with three ranges: first, no reinsurance below a certain threshold; second, reinsurance with a slope greater than 1; and finally, full reinsurance. When the marked process converges to a Poisson process, we recover the optimality of the deductible form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logistical challenges and high costs associated with procuring and transporting fuel to remote military bases underscore the need for sustainable and resilient energy solutions. Integrating renewable energy sources and electric vehicles into military microgrids offers a promising approach to enhance energy security and operational readiness. This paper explores the optimization of travel, charging, and discharging schedules for a fleet of military electric trucks, aiming to minimize reliance on fuel-generated electricity while ensuring that mission-critical transportation needs are met. We extend the classical Vehicle Scheduling Problem by incorporating Electric Vehicle Scheduling Problem dynamics and Vehicle-to-Grid capabilities, developing a comprehensive optimization model that addresses both logistical and energy demands within a military microgrid context. Utilizing a column generation approach, we efficiently solve large-scale instances and demonstrate significant improvements in fuel efficiency, renewable energy utilization, and overall operational cost. Computational experiments using realistic demand and solar generation data illustrate that integration of vehicle-to-grid enabled electric vehicles substantially reduces fuel consumption and can generate surplus energy returned to the grid. The results indicate that while battery constraints may require an increased fleet size, strategic scheduling of charging and discharging yields considerable economic and operational benefits. Our findings provide valuable insights for planners aiming to optimize energy use, reduce dependence on traditional fuel sources, and enhance operational resilience in remote environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling highly dynamic robotic systems subject to complex constraints. However, MPC is computationally demanding, and is often impractical to implement on small, resource-constrained robotic platforms. We present TinyMPC, a high-speed MPC solver with a low memory footprint targeting the microcontrollers common on small robots. Our approach is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and leverages the structure of the MPC problem for efficiency. We demonstrate TinyMPC's effectiveness by benchmarking against the state-of-the-art solver OSQP, achieving nearly an order of magnitude speed increase, as well as through hardware experiments on a 27 gram quadrotor, demonstrating high-speed trajectory tracking and dynamic obstacle avoidance. TinyMPC is publicly available at https://tinympc.org.</description>

      <title>Integrated Local Energy Decay for Damped Magnetic Wave Equations on Stationary Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish local energy decay for damped magnetic wave equations on stationary, asymptotically flat space-times subject to the geometric control condition. More specifically, we allow for the addition of time-independent magnetic and scalar potentials, which negatively affect energy coercivity and may add in unwieldy spectral effects. By asserting the non-existence of eigenvalues in the lower half-plane and resonances on the real line, we are able to apply spectral theory from the work of Metcalfe, Sterbenz, and Tataru and combine with a generalization of prior work by the present author to extend the latter work and establish local energy decay, under one additional symmetry hypothesis. Namely, we assume that the damping term is the dominant principal term in the skew-adjoint part of the damped wave operator within the region where the metric perturbation from that of Minkowski space is permitted to be large. We also obtain an energy dichotomy if we do not prohibit non-zero real resonances. In order to make the structure of the argument more cohesive, we contextualize the present work within the requisite existing theory.</description>

      <title>Semi-definite optimization of the measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum-classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.</description>

      <title>Differentiation Through Black-Box Quadratic Programming Solvers</title>

Abstract: Differentiable optimization has attracted significant research interest, particularly for quadratic programming (QP). Existing approaches for differentiating the solution of a QP with respect to its defining parameters often rely on specific integrated solvers. This integration limits their applicability, including their use in neural network architectures and bi-level optimization tasks, restricting users to a narrow selection of solver choices. To address this limitation, we introduce dQP, a modular and solver-agnostic framework for plug-and-play differentiation of virtually any QP solver. Our key theoretical insight is that the solution and its derivative can each be expressed in terms of closely-related and simple linear systems by using the active set at the solution. This insight enables efficient decoupling of the QP's solution, obtained by any solver, from its differentiation. Our open-source, minimal-overhead implementation will be made publicly available and seamlessly integrates with more than 15 state-of-the-art solvers. Comprehensive benchmark experiments demonstrate dQP's robustness and scalability, particularly highlighting its advantages in large-scale sparse problems.</description>

      <title>Changing the ranking in eigenvector centrality of a weighted graph by small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10745</link>

Abstract: In this article, we consider eigenvector centrality for the nodes of a graph and study the robustness (and stability) of this popular centrality measure. For a given weighted graph {\mathcal G} (both directed and undirected), we consider the associated weighted adjacency matrix A, which by definition is a non-negative matrix. The eigenvector centralities of the nodes of {\mathcal G} are the entries of the Perron eigenvector of A, which is the (positive) eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue with largest modulus. They provide a ranking of the nodes according to the corresponding centralities. An indicator of the robustness of eigenvector centrality consists in looking for a nearby perturbed graph \widetilde{\mathcal G}, with the same structure as {\mathcal G} (i.e., with the same vertices and edges), but with a weighted adjacency matrix \widetilde A such that the highest m entries (m \ge 2) of the Perron eigenvector of \widetilde A coalesce, making the ranking at the highest level ambiguous. To compute a solution to this matrix nearness problem, a nested iterative algorithm is proposed that makes use of a constrained gradient system of matrix differential equations in the inner iteration and a one-dimensional optimization of the perturbation size in the outer iteration. The proposed algorithm produces the {\em optimal} perturbation (i.e., the one with smallest Frobenius norm) of the A which causes the looked-for coalescence, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the graph. Our numerical experiments indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms more standard approaches based on algorithms for constrained optimization. The methodology is formulated in terms of graphs but applies to any nonnegative matrix, with potential applications in fields like population models, consensus dynamics, economics, etc.</description>

      <title>Fast, Accurate Manifold Denoising by Tunneling Riemannian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16819</link>

Abstract: Learned denoisers play a fundamental role in various signal generation (e.g., diffusion models) and reconstruction (e.g., compressed sensing) architectures, whose success derives from their ability to leverage low-dimensional structure in data. Existing denoising methods, however, either rely on local approximations that require a linear scan of the entire dataset or treat denoising as generic function approximation problems, often sacrificing efficiency and interpretability. We consider the problem of efficiently denoising a new noisy data point sampled from an unknown $d$-dimensional manifold $M \in \mathbb{R}^D$, using only noisy samples. This work proposes a framework for test-time efficient manifold denoising, by framing the concept of "learning-to-denoise" as "learning-to-optimize". We have two technical innovations: (i) online learning methods which learn to optimize over the manifold of clean signals using only noisy data, effectively "growing" an optimizer one sample at a time. (ii) mixed-order methods which guarantee that the learned optimizers achieve global optimality, ensuring both efficiency and near-optimal denoising performance. We corroborate these claims with theoretical analyses of both the complexity and denoising performance of mixed-order traversal. Our experiments on scientific manifolds demonstrate significantly improved complexity-performance tradeoffs compared to nearest neighbor search, which underpins existing provable denoising approaches based on exhaustive search.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilisation of Unstable Periodic Orbits of the Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many different models of the physical world exhibit chaotic dynamics, from fluid flows and chemical reactions to celestial mechanics. The study of the three-body problem (3BP) and its many different families of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) have provided fundamental insight into chaotic dynamics as far back as the 19th century. The 3BP, a conservative system, is inherently challenging to sample due to its volume-preservation property. In this paper we present an interpretable data-driven approach for the state-dependent control of UPOs in the 3BP, through leveraging the inherent sensitivity of chaos and the local manifold structure. We overcome the sampling challenge by utilising prior knowledge of UPOs and a novel augmentation strategy. This enables sample-efficient discovery of a verifiable and accurate local Poincar\'{e} map in as few as 55 data points. We suggest that the Poincar\'{e} map is best discovered at a surface of section where the norm of the monodromy matrix, i.e. the local sensitivity to small perturbations, is the smallest. To stabilise the UPOs, we apply small velocity impulses once each period, determined by solving a convex system of linear matrix inequalities based on the linearised map. We constrain the norm of the decision variables used to solve this system, resulting in locally optimal velocity impulses directed along the local stable manifold. Critically, this behaviour is achieved in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate this sample-efficient and low-energy method across several orbit families in the 3BP, with potential applications ranging from robotics and spacecraft control to fluid dynamics.</description>
