      <title>Engineering morphogenesis of cell clusters with differentiable programming</title>

Abstract: Understanding the rules underlying organismal development is a major unsolved problem in biology. Each cell in a developing organism responds to signals in its local environment by dividing, excreting, consuming, or reorganizing, yet how these individual actions coordinate over a macroscopic number of cells to grow complex structures with exquisite functionality is unknown. Here we use recent advances in automatic differentiation to discover local interaction rules and genetic networks that yield emergent, systems-level characteristics in a model of development. We consider a growing tissue with cellular interactions mediated by morphogen diffusion, cell adhesion and mechanical stress. Each cell has an internal genetic network that is used to make decisions based on the cell's local environment. We show that one can learn the parameters governing cell interactions in the form of interpretable genetic networks for complex developmental scenarios, including directed axial elongation, cell type homeostasis via chemical signaling and homogenization of growth via mechanical stress. When combined with recent experimental advances measuring spatio-temporal dynamics and gene expression of cells in a growing tissue, the methodology outlined here offers a promising path to unraveling the cellular bases of development.</description>

      <title>Bistability of travelling waves and wave-pinning states in a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system: From bifurcations to implications for actin waves</title>

Abstract: Eukaryotic cells demonstrate a wide variety of dynamic patterns of filamentous actin (F-actin) and its regulators. Some of these patterns play important roles in cell functions, such as distinct motility modes, which motivate this study. We devise a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model for active and inactive Rho-GTPase and F-actin in the cell cortex. The mass-conserved Rho-GTPase system promotes F-actin, which feeds back to inactivate the former. We study the model on a 1D periodic domain (edge of thin sheet-like cell) using bifurcation theory in the framework of spatial dynamics, complemented with numerical simulations. Among several discussed bifurcations, the analysis centers on the unfolding of the codimension-2 long wavelength and finite wavenumber Hopf instability, in which we describe a rich structure of steady wave-pinning states (a.k.a.\ mesas, obeying the Maxwell construction), propagating coherent solutions (fronts and excitable pulses), and travelling and standing waves, all distinguished by mass conservation regimes and classified by domain sizes. Specifically, we highlight the unexpected conditions for bistability between steady wave-pinning and travelling wave states on moderate domain sizes. These results uncover and exemplify possible mechanisms of coexistence, robustness, and transitions between distinct cellular motility modes, including directed migration, turning, and ruffling. More broadly, the results indicate that dissipative reaction-diffusion models comprising mass conservation have distinct pattern formation mechanisms that motivate further investigations, such as the unfolding of codimension-3 instabilities and T-points.</description>
