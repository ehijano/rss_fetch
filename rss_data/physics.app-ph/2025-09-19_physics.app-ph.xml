      <title>Kilovolt-Class $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ Field-Plated Schottky Barrier Diodes with MOCVD-Grown Intentionally $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ Doped Drift Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the growth optimization of intentionally low-doped ($10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$) high-quality $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ drift layers up to 10 $\mu m$ thick via MOCVD and the fabrication of kilovolt-class field plated Schottky barrier diodes on these thick drift layers. Homoepitaxial growth was performed on (010) $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ substrates using TMGa as the Ga precursor. Growth parameters were systematically optimized to determine the best conditions for high quality thick growths with the given reactor geometry. Chamber pressure was found to improve the growth rate, mobility, and roughness of the samples. Growth rates of up to 7.2 $\mu m$/hr., thicknesses of up to 10 $\mu m$, Hall mobilities of up to 176 $cm^2$/Vs, RMS roughness down to 5.45 nm, UID concentrations as low as $2 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$, and controllable intentional doping down to $3 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ were achieved. Field plated Schottky barrier diodes (FP-SBDs) were fabricated on a $6.5 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ intentionally doped 10 $\mu m$ thick film to determine the electrical performance of the MOCVD-grown material. The FP-SBD was found to have current density $&gt;$100 A/$cm^2$ at 3 V forward bias with a specific differential on resistance ($R_{on,sp}$) of 16.22 m$\Omega$.$cm^2$ and a turn on voltage of 1 V. The diodes were found to have high quality anode metal/semiconductor interfaces with an ideality factor of 1.04, close to unity. Diodes had a maximum breakdown voltage of 1.50 kV, leading to a punch-through maximum field of 2.04 MV/cm under the anode metal, which is a state-of-the-art result for SBDs on MOCVD-grown (010) drift layers.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetics of deeply subwavelength metamaterial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses electromagnetic properties of volumetric metamaterial samples with essentially discrete structure, that is, assembled as a periodic array of electromagnetic resonators. We develop an efficient numerical procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response precisely to analyse samples containing several million meta-atoms. We demonstrate that, contrary to a common belief, even million-``atoms'' samples with sharp edges are still quite different from uniform (``homogenised'') materials, and their properties are critically sensitive to their shape and boundary structure. We also compare our results with calculations based on the discrete dipole approximation as well as with an integral model for continuous particles, and analyse distinctions and similarities between the different approaches. In particular, discrete metamaterials present themselves as a stringent platform for assessing continuous models developed for finite objects with sharp edges. Overall, the reported results should be important for understanding mesoscopic systems with strongly interacting elements.</description>

      <title>Disordered continuity: Stochastic design of metamaterials towards spatially modulated stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural materials, such as bones and wood, are structured with irregular composites and exhibit smooth distribution of macroscopic physical properties towards desired functionalities including withstanding mechanical forces, energy absorption and modulated deformation. To extend beyond natural synthesis, the design of functional metamaterials requires the solution of two inverse problems, i.e., modulating the spatial distribution of physical properties to achieve target functionalities, and generating geometric structures to realize the desired physical property distribution. Until now, realizing special functionalities from metamaterials primarily relies on the process of joining individual 'building blocks' of functional materials, which are deliberately designed to attain required responsive behaviors, such as the non-uniform displacement field. However, the discontinuity of the physical property distribution between the building blocks in the resulted structure, often leads to problems such as excessive stress concentration in the joining areas and limited design flexibility. To overcome the above problems, we proposed a new method for automatic design of functional metamaterials to achieve continuity in both geometry and physical properties. The fundamental theory of the method is the incorporation of spherical harmonics to represent and modulate the spatial distribution of stiffness, which then serves as a non-uniform distribution function for stochastic generation of anisotropic spinodal infills with high continuity. The proposed method have potential wide applications for designing functional components with programmed responsive behaviors, such as realizing customized tissue supporting and information encoding.</description>

      <title>Geometry Dependence of Charge Transport in Nanoscopic Au@PANI Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid nanostructures from metal nanoparticles equipped with conducting polymer shells are of great interest for use as functional materials in sensing and optoelectronics, as well as for ink-deposited conductors. Here, we investigate the charge transport mechanism of nanostructures composed of gold nanoparticles coated with a polyaniline shell (Au@PANI). In particular, we focus on how geometry influences the charge transport behavior. Highly ordered linear assemblies of Au@PANI nanoparticles were fabricated using template-assisted assembly, while bulk-like films were obtained via drop-casting. Temperature-dependent transport measurements were analyzed using established theoretical models. Linear assemblies exhibit more localized transport, characterized by variable-range hopping (VRH) and thermally assisted tunneling (TAT), whereas bulk-like films show more delocalized transport, dominated by Arrhenius-type and thermionic conduction. These findings highlight the critical role of geometry in determining charge transport mechanisms in nanoparticle-based hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Chiral Photonic-Crystal Cavity with Broken Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions in chiral cavities offer a compelling route to manipulate material properties by breaking fundamental symmetries such as time-reversal symmetry. However, only a limited number of chiral cavity implementations exhibiting broken time-reversal symmetry have been demonstrated to date. These typically rely on either the application of strong magnetic fields, circularly polarized Floquet driving, or the hybridization of cavity modes with matter excitations in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Here, we present a one-dimensional terahertz photonic-crystal cavity that exhibits broken time-reversal symmetry. The cavity consists of a high-resistivity silicon wafer sandwiched between lightly n-doped InSb wafers. By exploiting the nonreciprocal response of a terahertz magnetoplasma and the exceptionally low effective mass of electrons in InSb, we demonstrate a circularly polarized cavity mode at 0.67 THz under a modest magnetic field of 0.3 T, with a quality factor exceeding 50. Temperature-, magnetic field-, and polarization-dependent measurements, supported by simulations, confirm the realization of a chiral cavity with broken time-reversal symmetry. This platform offers a robust and accessible approach for exploring chiral light--matter interactions and vacuum dressed quantum condensed matter in the terahertz regime.</description>

      <title>Terahertz amplification by injection locking of waveguide resonant tunneling diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High power and low phase noise oscillators at terahertz frequencies are required for several burgeoning scientific and technological applications, including radioastronomy, imaging, molecular spectroscopy, radar, and wireless communications. Operating at terahertz oscillation frequencies presents unique challenges based on the method of generation. Electronic oscillators can produce ample power but suffer from relatively high phase noise due to the nonlinear multiplication of microwave sources. Meanwhile, photomixing of optical sources provides superior spectral purity but low usable power, due to the limited bandwidth of the photomixer. We propose a hybrid solution involving injection locking of an electronic oscillator, a resonant tunneling diode, by a low phase noise photomixed source, a dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. In this study, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept injection-locking amplifier at 260 GHz, achieving up to 40 dB gain for nanowatt-level input signals. For the first time, we characterize the residual phase noise of an injection-locked waveguide RTD, showing quantitative consistency with theoretical predictions based on detailed analysis of its free-running noise. This architecture has the potential to scale to frequencies of 1 THz and beyond, which would provide a clear path to realize a terahertz oscillator with high power and low phase noise.</description>

      <title>The superconducting grid-states qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence errors arising from noisy environments remain a central obstacle to progress in quantum computation and information processing. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) protocol offers a powerful strategy to overcome this challenge, with successful demonstrations in trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonics. Beyond active QEC, a compelling alternative is to engineer Hamiltonians that intrinsically enforce stabilizers, offering passive protection akin to topological models. Inspired by the GKP encoding scheme, we implement a superconducting qubit whose eigenstates form protected grid states - long envisioned but not previously realized - by integrating an effective Cooper-quartet junction with a quantum phase-slip element embedded in a high-impedance circuit. Spectroscopic measurements reveal pairs of degenerate states separated by large energy gaps, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Remarkably, our observations indicate that the circuit tolerates small disorders and gains robustness against environmental noise as its parameters approach the ideal regime, establishing a new framework for exploring superconducting hardware. These findings also showcase the versatility of the superconducting circuit toolbox, setting the stage for future exploration of advanced solid-state devices with emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of defective scandium nitride nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Oscillations in Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
  leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cavity from Tunable Coupling between Anapole and Fabry-Perot Resonance or Anti-resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions depends critically on the ability to tailor photonic modes at subwavelength scales, and combining distinct resonant modes has shown remarkable potential unattainable by individual resonances alone. Despite recent advances in anapole metasurfaces for energy confinement and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities for spectral control, their synergistic coupling and resulting opportunities remain largely unexplored due to challenges such as precise nanoscale assembly. Here, we demonstrate that embedding a terahertz (THz) anapole metasurface within a tunable FP cavity results in a hybrid cavity that demonstrates exotic properties as the anapole transitions between coupling to FP resonances and anti-resonances via cavity-length tuning. At room temperature, we observe ultrastrong coupling (&gt; 30% of the anapole frequency) between anapoles and FP resonances, generating tunable-dispersion polaritons that blend favorable properties of both modes. Meanwhile, anapole spectrally aligns with FP anti-resonances, leading to weak coupling that narrows the linewidth of the anapole's transmission peak by two orders of magnitude and enhances its local density of states (LDOS) near the metasurface correspondingly. With exceptional capabilities including formation of polaritons and significant enhancement of LDOS, the hybrid cavity enables strong interaction with functional materials, paving the way for exploration of quantum optics, molecular sensing, and ultrafast nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Effective interface forces to model boundary effects in a finite-size metamaterial through the reduced relaxed micromorphic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the reduced relaxed micromorphic model (RRMM) to capture the effective "bulk" dynamical response of finite size metamaterial specimens made out of a Labyrinthine unit cell. We show that for small finite-size specimens, boundary effects can play a major role, so that the RRMM needs an enrichment to capture the metamaterial's bulk response, as well as the boundary effects. A benchmark test is introduced to show that different metamaterial/ homogeneous material interfaces can drive completely different responses even if the bulk metamaterial remains the same. We show with no remaining doubts that the concept of "interface forces" must necessarily be introduced if one wants to model finite-size metamaterials in a homogenized framework.</description>

      <title>Direct integration of atomic precision advanced manufacturing into middle-of-line silicon fabrication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</description>

      <title>Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL): A Framework for Modeling Complex Predator-Prey Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</description>
