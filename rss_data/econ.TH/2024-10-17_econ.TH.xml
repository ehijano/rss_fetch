      <title>Analyzing Incentives and Fairness in Ordered Weighted Average for Facility Location Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facility location games provide an abstract model of mechanism design. In such games, a mechanism takes a profile of $n$ single-peaked preferences over an interval as an input and determines the location of a facility on the interval. In this paper, we restrict our attention to distance-based single-peaked preferences and focus on a well-known class of parameterized mechanisms called ordered weighted average methods, which is proposed by Yager in 1988 and contains several practical implementations such as the standard average and the Olympic average. We comprehensively analyze their performance in terms of both incentives and fairness. More specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on their parameters to achieve strategy-proofness, non-obvious manipulability, individual fair share, and proportional fairness, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Subtlety of Optimal Paternalism in a Population with Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a utilitarian planner with the power to design a discrete choice set for a heterogeneous population with bounded rationality. We find that optimal paternalism is subtle. The policy that most effectively constrains or influences choices depends on the preference distribution of the population and on the choice probabilities conditional on preferences that measure the suboptimality of behavior. We first consider the planning problem in abstraction. We next examine policy choice when individuals measure utility with additive random error and maximize mismeasured rather than actual utility. We then analyze a class of problems of binary treatment choice under uncertainty. Here we suppose that a planner can mandate a treatment conditional on publicly observed personal covariates or can decentralize decision making, enabling persons to choose their own treatments. Bounded rationality may take the form of deviations between subjective personal beliefs and objective probabilities of uncertain outcomes. We apply our analysis to clinical decision making in medicine. Having documented that optimization of paternalism requires the planner to possess extensive knowledge that is rarely available, we address the difficult problem of paternalistic policy choice when the planner is boundedly rational.</description>

      <title>Both invariant principles implied by Marx's law of value are necessary and sufficient to solve the transformation problem through Morishima's formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unit value of a commodity that Michio Morishima's method and its variations enable to determine correctly, is the sum of the value of the commodities it contains (inputs) and the quantity of labor required for its production. However, goods are sold at their price of production only when they meet a solvent social need that involves the entire economy with its interconnections between the different industrial sectors. This condition gives full meaning to Marx's fundamental equalities, which constitute invariants that apply to the economy as a whole. These equalities are necessary to determine prices of production. We demonstrate that they also enable to solve the transformation problem by starting from Morishima's formalism and returning to a formalism closer to that used by Marx.</description>

      <title>Non-diversified portfolios with subjective expected utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diversification is the typical investment strategy of risk-averse agents. However, non-diversified positions that allocate all resources to a single asset, state of the world or revenue stream are common too. We show that whenever finitely many non-diversified demands under uncertainty are compatible with risk-averse subjective expected utility maximization under strictly positive beliefs, they are also rationalizable under the same beliefs by many qualitatively distinct risk-averse as well as risk-neutral and risk-seeking preferences.</description>

      <title>School Choice with Multiple Priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04780v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study considers a model where schools may have multiple priority orders on students, which may be inconsistent with each other. For example, in school choice systems, since the sibling priority and the walk zone priority coexist, the priority orders based on them would be conflicting. We introduce a weaker fairness notion called M-fairness to examine such markets. Further, we focus on a more specific situation where all schools have only two priority orders, and for a certain group of students, a priority order of each school is an improvement of the other priority order of the school. An illustrative example is the school choice matching market with a priority-based affirmative action policy. We introduce a mechanism that utilizes the efficiency adjusted deferred acceptance algorithm and show that the mechanism satisfies properties called responsiveness to improvements and improved-group optimally M-stability, which is stronger than student optimally M-stability.</description>

      <title>Learning Macroeconomic Policies based on Microfoundations: A Stackelberg Mean Field Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lucas critique emphasizes the importance of considering microfoundations, how micro-agents (i.e., households) respond to policy changes, in macroeconomic policymaking. However, due to the vast scale and complex dynamics among micro-agents, predicting microfoundations is challenging. Consequently, this paper introduces a Stackelberg Mean Field Game (SMFG) approach that models macroeconomic policymaking based on microfoundations, with the government as the leader and micro-agents as dynamic followers. This approach treats large-scale micro-agents as a population, to optimize macroeconomic policies by learning the dynamic response of this micro-population. Our experimental results indicate that the SMFG approach outperforms real-world macroeconomic policies, existing AI-based and economic methods, enabling the learned macroeconomic policy to achieve the highest performance while guiding large-scale micro-agents toward maximal social welfare. Additionally, when extended to real-world scenarios, households that do not adopt the SMFG policy experience lower utility and wealth than adopters, thereby increasing the attractiveness of our policy. In summary, this paper contributes to the field of AI for economics by offering an effective tool for modeling and solving macroeconomic policymaking issues.</description>

      <title>Embracing the Enemy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the repeated interactions between two power-hungry agents, the "friend", and the "enemy," and one power broker, the principal. All three care about the leading agent's policy choice. The principal, who aligns more with the friend, can influence but not fully control leadership allocation. After an initial cordon sanitaire breaks, the principal embraces the enemy, sometimes promising persistent support: she grants the enemy power in exchange for moderation, which benefits the friend who reciprocates. The closer the principal is to the friend, the more she desires to embrace the enemy, but the harder it is to uphold such promises.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Agents through Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the optimal design of ratings to motivate agent investment in quality when transfers are unavailable. The principal designs a rating scheme that maps the agent's quality to a (possibly stochastic) score. The agent has private information about his ability, which determines his cost of investment, and chooses the quality level. The market observes the score and offers a wage equal to the agent's expected quality. For example, a school incentivizes learning through a grading policy that reveals students' quality to the job market.
  I reduce the principal's problem to the design of an interim wage function of quality. When restricted to deterministic ratings, I provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of simple pass/fail tests and lower censorship. In particular, when the principal's objective is expected quality, a sufficient condition for the optimality of pass/fail tests (lower censorship) is the ability distribution has an increasing (unimodal) density. The results generalize existing results in optimal delegation with voluntary participation, as pass/fail tests (lower censorship) correspond to take-it-or-leave-it offers (threshold delegation). Additionally, I provide sufficient conditions for pass/fail tests and lower censorship to remain optimal without restriction to deterministic ratings. Pass/fail tests remain optimal for quality maximization if the ability density is increasing.</description>

      <title>Monetizing digital content with network effects: A mechanism-design approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design profit-maximizing mechanisms to sell an excludable and non-rival good with network effects. Buyers have heterogeneous private values that depend on how many others also consume the good. In optimum, an endogenous number of the highest types consume the good, and we provide an algorithm that implements this allocation in dominant strategies. We apply our insights to digital content creation, and we are able to rationalize features seen in monetization schemes in this industry such as voluntary contributions, community subsidies, and exclusivity bids.</description>

      <title>The Strong Maximum Circulation Algorithm: A New Method for Aggregating Preference Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new optimization-based method for aggregating preferences in settings where each voter expresses preferences over pairs of alternatives. Our approach to identifying a consensus partial order is motivated by the observation that collections of votes that form a cycle can be treated as collective ties. Our approach then removes unions of cycles of votes, or circulations, from the vote graph and determines aggregate preferences from the remainder. Specifically, we study the removal of maximal circulations attained by any union of cycles the removal of which leaves an acyclic graph. We introduce the strong maximum circulation, the removal of which guarantees a unique outcome in terms of the induced partial order, called the strong partial order. The strong maximum circulation also satisfies strong complementary slackness conditions, and is shown to be solved efficiently as a network flow problem. We further establish the relationship between the dual of the maximum circulation problem and Kemeny's method, a popular optimization-based approach for preference aggregation. We also show that identifying a minimum maximal circulation -- i.e., a maximal circulation containing the smallest number of votes -- is an NP-hard problem. Further an instance of the minimum maximal circulation may have multiple optimal solutions whose removal results in conflicting partial orders.</description>
