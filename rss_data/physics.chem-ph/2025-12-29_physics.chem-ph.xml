      <title>Thermal conductivities of monolayer graphene oxide from machine learning molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO) exhibits rich chemical heterogeneity that strongly influences its structural, thermal, and mechanical properties, yet quantitatively linking reduction chemistry to heat transport remains challenging. In this work, we develop a machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) trained on an existing density functional theory dataset (\textit{Angew.\ Chem.\ Int.\ Ed.}, \textbf{63} , e202410088 (2024)), achieving reasonable accuracy at a computational cost much lower than the existing machine-learned and empirical potentials. Leveraging this potential, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model the thermal reduction of GO across realistic structural domains. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method with a proper quantum-statistical correction scheme, we find that reduced GO exhibits strongly suppressed thermal conductivities, ranging from a few to tens of Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, substantially lower than pristine GO without defects and far below graphene. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of reduced GO increases moderately with increasing OH/O ratio, except at the highest oxidation level (O/C=0.5) where this trend inverts, while decreasing significantly with increasing O/C ratio, a trend strongly correlated with the fraction of recovered graphene-like structures. Our work provides a computationally tractable and predictive atomistic machine learning framework for exploring how chemical structure governs heat transport in heterogeneous carbon materials.</description>

      <title>A novel implementation of CCSD analytic gradients using Cholesky decomposition of the two-electron integrals and Abelian point-group symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel and efficient implementation of coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) analytic gradients that combines the Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron-repulsion integrals with the exploitation of Abelian point-group symmetry. This approach is particularly effective for medium-sized and large symmetric molecular systems. The CD of two-electron integrals is performed using a symmetry-adapted two-step algorithm, while the derivatives of the Cholesky vectors are computed with respect to symmetry-adapted nuclear displacements and contracted on-the-fly with the CCSD density matrices. Geometry optimizations of symmetric systems with several hundreds of basis functions have been carried out to assess the efficiency of our implementation and to quantify the computational gain provided by the exploitation of point-group symmetry.</description>

      <title>Structure, biomineralization and biodegradation of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates synthesized by inorganic salt coprecipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, a novel group of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates containing different levels of fluoride substituting for oxide was synthesized by an inorganic salt coprecipitation process followed by calcination/sintering. The effects of the incorporation of fluoride on the resultant structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability and biodegradability were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and pH measurements. According to the results, the samples containing up to 2 mol% F present a single-phase structure of diopside (MgCaSi2O6) doped with F. It was also found that to meet the most biomineralization characteristic, the optimal value of fluoride in the homogeneous samples is 1 mol%. In this regard, on the one hand, the partial incorporation of fluoride into apatite (via forming fluorohydroxyapatite) and, on the other hand, the absence of fluorite (CaF2) as a consumer of Ca in the deposits are responsible for achieving the most apatite-forming ability circumstance controlled by an ion-exchange reaction mechanism. In conclusion, this study reflects the merit of the optimization of fluoride-doping into Ca-Mg silicates for development in biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Search for Topological Protection in Open Quantum Hardware: The Dissipative Mixed Hodge Module Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard spectroscopic protocols model the dynamics of open quantum systems as a superposition of isolated, exponentially decaying eigenmodes. This paradigm fails fundamentally at Exceptional Points, where the eigenbasis collapses and the response becomes dominated by non-diagonalizable Jordan blocks. We resolve this ambiguity by introducing a geometric framework based on \textit{Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules} (DMHM). By replacing the scalar linewidth with a topological \textit{Weight Filtration}, we derive ``Weight Filtered Spectroscopy'' (WFS)--a protocol that spatially separates decay channels based on the nilpotency rank of the Liouvillian. We demonstrate that WFS acts as a dissipative x-ray, quantifying dissipative leakage in molecular polaritons and certifying topological isolation in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm rings. This establishes that topological protection persists as an algebraic invariant even when the spectral gap is closed.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Autonomous Goal-evolving Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.</description>

      <title>Impact of the sodium and calcium chlorides uptake on the interfacial behavior of ice: premelting, structure, and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Seawater ice and frozen aqueous solutions in contact with air can exhibit a thin quasi-brine surface layer intruding between ice and vapor, but a detailed characterization of surface properties and its relation to three phase coexistence has been lacking. Using thermodynamic arguments we show how it is possible to characterize the surface layers by comparison to the three phase ice-brine-air bulk phase diagram, despite the difficulty to control or monitor all of the relevant thermodynamic fields of the two component system.
  Simulations: We performed computer simulations of surface briny layers of sodium and calcium chloride adsorbed on ice. Using suitable order parameters and a rigorous geometrical dividing surface, we are able to characterize the layer's thermodynamic state, measure its properties and relate them to the corresponding properties of the bulk solution.
  Results: Our results confirm that undersaturated briny surface layers can form down to the eutectic point, with a maximum concentration that is bound by the liquidus line of the ice-brine phase diagram. Such layers are distinct from finite size realizations of three phase coexistence, and can be regarded as genuine surface states, but their salt content can increase the premelting layer thickness by a factor of two or more. Owing to this significant thickness, these layers can be related to bulk electrolyte solutions of similar concentration, both as regards the structural organization of ions and the dynamical properties of the quasi-liquid film.</description>

      <title>Double-Layered Silica-Engineered Fluorescent Nanodiamonds for Catalytic Generation and Quantum Sensing of Active Radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) hosting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have attracted considerable attention for quantum sensing applications, particularly owing to notable advancements achieved in the field of weak magnetic signal detection in recent years. Here, we report a practical quantum-sensing platform for the controlled production and real-time monitoring of ultra-short-lived reactive free radicals using a double-layered silica modification strategy. An inner dense silica layer preserves the intrinsic properties of NV centers, while an outer porous silica layer facilitates efficient adsorption and stabilization of hydroxyl radicals and their precursor reactants. By doping this mesoporous shell with gadolinium (III) catalysts, we achieve sustained, light-free generation of hydroxyl radicals via catalytic water splitting, eliminating reliance on external precursors. The mechanism underlying this efficient radical generation is discussed in detail. The radical production is monitored in real time and in situ through spin-dependent T1 relaxometry of the NV centers, demonstrating stable and tunable radical fluxes, with concentration tunable across a continuous range from approximately 100 mM to molar levels by adjusting the catalyst condition. This study extends the technical application of nanodiamonds from relaxation sensing to the controlled synthesis of reactive free radicals, thereby providing robust experimental evidence to support the advancement of quantum sensing systems in intelligent manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Tuning diffusioosmosis of electrolyte solutions by hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two reservoirs of a distinct salinity are connected by channels or pores, a fluid flow termed diffusio-osmotic is generated. This article investigates the flow emerging in an uniformly charged long slit whose thickness exceeds the local Debye screening length. Attention is focussed on the role of hydrostatic pressure drop $\Delta p$ between reservoirs. For a thick slit we recover the known formula for a local diffusioosmotic slip over a single wall, which is determined by the surface potential, salt concentration and its gradient. An equation for the global fluid flow rate $\mathcal{Q}$ is presented as a sum of the diffusio-osmotic and pressure-driven contributions. Although the diffusio-osmotic term itself remains unaffected by $\Delta p$, the concentration and surface potential profiles along the slit, and consequently, the local slip velocity are dramatically modified. We present an equation relating the local concentration to $\mathcal{Q}$ and employ it to derive an expression describing the surface potential variation in the slit. Since $\mathcal{Q}$ can easily be tuned by $\Delta p$, the variety of possible concentration and surface potential profiles becomes very rich. Our theory provides a simple explanation of recent flow rate measurements and shows that experimental data provide rather direct information about concentration and surface potential profiles in the uniformly charged slit. The relevance of our results for sensing the salt dependence of surface potentials is discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>Multiscale filtration framework with nanoconfined phase behavior: Pore Network Modeling with Density Functional Theory calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of fluid flow in real, multiscale porous media remains challenging due to the complexity of nanoscale phenomena and the difficulty of developing upscaling methodologies. In this study, we introduce a multiscale filtration framework based on Pore Network Modeling, incorporating the effects of pore blockage resulting from capillary condensation of fluid in the nanoporous space. To accurately predict capillary condensation in nanoconfinement, we apply classical Density Functional Theory calculations along with the consideration of capillary hysteresis. The pores blocked by condensate are excluded from the fluid flow, leading to a drop in permeability of the porous space. Our findings demonstrate that the resulting permeability is strongly dependent on the geometry of porous space, including pore size distribution, sample size, and the particular structure of the sample, along with thermodynamic conditions and processes, specifically, pressure growth or reduction. Overall, the presented research contributes valuable insights into multiscale transport phenomena and facilitates the advancement of upscaling techniques.</description>

      <title>CO$_2$ Dissociative Sticking on Cu(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the dissociation of CO$_2$ on Cu(110) by performing density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functional, with a potential energy surface parameterized using artificial neural networks. We computed quasi-classical trajectory calculations of molecular and dissociative adsorption probabilities as a function of the initial impact energy of the molecules and surface temperature, by comparing our results with available supersonic molecular beam experimental data for normal incidence. Concerning the general dependence of the molecular and dissociative adsorption probabilities on the initial translational energy of the molecules, our theoretical results agree with experiments. Also in agreement with experiments, we have found that dissociative adsorption is not affected by surface temperature between 50 and 400 K, for impact energies for which the dissociation probability is larger than $\sim 10^{-3}$. We have investigated the influence of impact energy and surface temperature on the final state of the dissociation products by extending the time integration of the reactive trajectories up to 10 ps. We have found that above $\sim 2.5$ eV and close to or above room temperature, CO$_2$ dissociation induces strong surface distortions including final structures involving Cu adatoms. The creation of Cu vacancy-adatom pairs is stimulated by the presence of both CO$_{ads}$ and O$_{ads}$ which interact strongly with the Cu adatoms and even give rise to unexpected (O-Cu-CO)$_{ads}$ linear moieties anchored to the surface by the dissociated O atom and involving a Cu adatom almost detached from the surface. These surface distortions produced by dissociation products of high energy CO$_2$ molecules at and above room temperature might explain recent experiments that have found a greater saturation oxygen coverage for high energy molecules.</description>

      <title>Interplay between electronic and phononic energy dissipation channels in the adsorption of CO on Cu(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relative importance of electronic and phononic energy dissipation during the molecular adsorption of CO on Cu(110). Initial sticking probabilities as a function of impact energy for CO impinging at normal incidence at a surface temperature of 90 K were computed using classical trajectory simulations. To this aim, we use a full-dimensional potential energy surface constructed using an atomistic neural network trained on density functional theory data obtained with the nonlocal vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functional. Two models are compared: one allowing only energy transfer and dissipation from the molecule to lattice vibrations, and the other also incorporating the effect of molecular energy loss due to the excitation of electron-hole pairs, modeled within the local-density friction approximation. Our results reveal, firstly, that the molecule mainly transfers energy to lattice vibrations, and this channel determines the adsorption probabilities, with electronic friction playing a minor role. Secondly, once the molecule is trapped near the surface (where electronic density is higher), electron-hole pair excitations accelerate energy dissipation, significantly promoting CO thermalization. Still, the faster energy dissipation when electron-hole pair excitations are accounted for accelerates the accommodation of the adsorbed molecules in the chemisorption well but does not significantly alter their lateral displacements over the surface.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Representation of Time-Evolving Neural Network-based Wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is pivotal for modeling non-adiabatic electron dynamics, a key process in ultrafast spectroscopy and laser-matter interactions. However, exact solutions to the TDSE remain computationally prohibitive for most realistic systems, as the Hilbert space expands exponentially with dimensionality. In this work, we propose an approach integrating the stochastic representation framework with a neural network wavefunction ansatz, a flexible model capable of approximating time-evolving quantum wavefunctions. We first validate the method on one-dimensional single-electron systems, focusing on ionization dynamics under intense laser fields, a critical process in attosecond physics. Our results demonstrate that the approach accurately reproduces key features of quantum evolution, including the energy and dipole evolution during ionization. We further show the feasibility of extending this approach to three-dimensional systems. Due to the increased complexity of real-time simulations in higher dimensions, these results remain at an early stage and highlight the need for more advanced stabilization strategies.</description>

      <title>Validation of Quantum Computing for Transition Metal Oxide-based Automotive Catalysis</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</description>

Abstract: Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve coupled phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of coupled phonon-ion hopping modes which enhance Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes greatly increases the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of vibrational modes associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving TiO6 rocking modes via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the differential impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons. Additionally, we differentiate the ultrafast responses of LLTO due to ultrafast heating and THz-range vibrations using laser-driven spectroscopy (LUIS), finding a unique long-lived response for the THz-range excitation. These findings provide new insights into coupled ion migration mechanisms, indicating the important role of THz-range coupled phonon-ion hopping modes in enabling fast ion conduction at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evaluation of decay mode of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ in solid samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4 \, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states. However, the reported half-lives of the $ \gamma $-ray transition are not consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by density functional theory calculations. Based on these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life of each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $ \mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition, whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ one decays via the $ \gamma $-ray transition and has a possibility of decay via internal conversion and electron bridge.</description>

      <title>Supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations using quantum phase estimation algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate computation of non-covalent, intermolecular interaction energies is important to understand various chemical phenomena, and quantum computers are anticipated to accelerate it. Although the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and intermediate-scale ones, development of theoretical frameworks those are expected to work on a fault-tolerant quantum computer is an urgent issue. In this work, we explore resource-efficient implementation of the quantum phase estimation-based complete active space configuration interaction (QPE-CASCI) calculations, with the aid of the second-order M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)-based active space selection with Boys localized orbitals. We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Preliminary results on quantum circuit compression for QPE are also presented to reduce the number of two-qubit gates and depth.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>
