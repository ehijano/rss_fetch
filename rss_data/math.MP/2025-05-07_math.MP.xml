      <title>Extended states for the Random Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d\geq 5$) with decaying Bernoulli potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the delocalization property of the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H_\omega=-\Delta+v_n\omega_n\delta_{n,n'}$, where $v_n=\kappa |n|^{-\alpha}$ and $\omega=\{\omega_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d}\in \{\pm 1\}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. Under the assumptions of $d\geq 5$, $\alpha&gt;\frac14$ and $0&lt;\kappa\ll1$, we construct the extended states for a deterministic renormalization of $H_\omega$ for most $\omega$. This extends the work of Bourgain [{\it Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis}, LNM 1807: 70--98, 2003], where the case $\alpha&gt;\frac13$ was handled. Our proof is based on Green's function estimates via a $6$th-order renormalization scheme. Among the main new ingredients are the proof of a generalized Khintchine inequality via Bonami's lemma, and the application of the fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality to control a new type of non-random operators arising from the $6$th-order renormalization.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading of the Lie algebra $G_2$ and related color algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a special and attractive basis for the exceptional Lie algebra $G_2$, which turns $G_2$ into a $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-graded Lie algebra. There are two basis elements for each degree of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3\setminus\{(0,0,0)\}$, thus yielding 14 basis elements. We give a general and simple closed form expression for commutators between these basis elements. Next, we use this $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading in order to examine graded color algebras. Our analysis yields three different $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-graded color algebras of type $G_2$. Since the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading is not compatible with a Cartan-Weyl basis of $G_2$, we also study another grading of $G_2$. This is a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading, compatible with a Cartan-Weyl basis, and for which we can also construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color algebra of type $G_2$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial deformations of $sl(2)$ and unified algebraic framework for solutions of a class of spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce novel polynomial deformations of the Lie algebra $sl(2)$. We construct their finite-dimensional irreducible representations and the corresponding differential operator realizations. We apply our results to a class of spin models with hidden polynomial algebra symmetry and obtain the closed-form expressions for their energies and wave functions by means of the Bethe ansatz method. The general framework enables us to give an unified algebraic and analytic treatment for three interesting spin models with hidden cubic algebra symmetry: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, the molecular asymmetric rigid rotor, and the two-axis countertwisting squeezing model. We provide analytic and numerical insights into the structures of the roots of the Bethe ansatz equations (i.e. the so-called Bethe roots) of these models. We give descriptions of the roots on the spheres using the inverse stereographic projection. The changes in nature and pattern of the Bethe roots on the spheres indicate the existence of different phases of the models. We also present the fidelity and derivatives of the ground-state energies (with respect to model parameters) of the models. The results indicate the presence of critical points and phase transitions of the models. In the appendix, we show that, unlike the so-called Bender-Dunne polynomials, the set of polynomials in the energy $E$, $P_\ell(E)$, corresponding to each of the three spin models has two critical polynomials whose zeros give the quasi-exact energy eigenvalues of the model. Such types of polynomials seem new.</description>

      <title>What is a Gaussian channel, and when is it physically implementable using a multiport interferometer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Gaussian channels are fundamental models for communication and information processing in continuous-variable quantum systems. This work addresses both foundational aspects and physical implementation pathways for these channels. Firstly, we provide a rigorous, unified framework by formally proving the equivalence of three principal definitions of quantum Gaussian channels prevalent in the literature, consolidating theoretical understanding. Secondly, we investigate the physical realization of these channels using multiport interferometers, a key platform in quantum optics. The central research contribution is a precise characterization of the channel parameters that correspond to Gaussian channels physically implementable via linear optical multiport interferometers. This characterization bridges the abstract mathematical description with concrete physical architectures. Along the way, we also resolve some questions posed by Parthasarathy (Indian J. Pure Appl. Math. 46, (2015)).</description>

      <title>Recovery of the matrix potential of the one-dimensional Dirac equation from spectral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for solving an inverse spectral problem for the one-dimensional Dirac equation is developed. The method is based on the Gelfand-Levitan equation and the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. A linear algebraic system of equations is obtained, which can be solved numerically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical method for the solution of the inverse problem for the one-dimensional Dirac equation on a finite interval.</description>

Abstract: We consider a system of polynomials $T_{s}(z,q)\in\mathbb{Z}[z,q]$ which appear as truncations of the K-theoretic vertex function for the cotangent bundles over Grassmannians $T^{*}Gr(k,n)$. We prove that these polynomials satisfy a natural $q-$deformation of Dwork's congruences \[\frac{T_{s+1}(z,q)}{T_{s}(z^{p},q^{p})}\equiv\frac{T_{s}(z,q)}{T_{s-1}(z^{p},q^{p})}\text{ (mod } [p^{s}]_{q})\] In the limit $q\to 1$ we recover the main result of arXiv:2302.03092v3</description>

      <title>On local fields invariant under the action of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look into the problem of constructing and classifying pairs consisting of a local operator and a topological defect which commutes or anticommutes with it. We discuss the bulk and boundary versions of the problem. In the latter one considers a conformal boundary condition, a boundary operator on it and a junction with a topological defect. In the case of the charge conjugation modular invariant commuting configurations in each problem can be obtained when a certain restriction on the fusion rules in realised. We study the corresponding fusion rule problems in detail. While in the bulk case it reduces to realising the $a\times b = c$ fusion rule which was studied in arXiv:2012.14689 [hep-th], in the boundary it leads to a new type of problem. We obtain a full solution to this problem for the $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ WZW theory, thus constructing a class of commuting boundary operators and junctions in that theory, and suggest an approach to general WZW theories.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations, restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not a Lagrangian system as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting the dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for the original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is a particle in a central field with varying trajectories restricted by the equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space acquires one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for the precession of trajectories. The second example is linearized gravity with the Einstein-Hilbert action, and the class of varying fields is restricted by the linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>

      <title>Transport in multifractal Kraichnan flows: from turbulence to Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of fluid trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection. The model couples a one-dimensional, Gaussian, white-in-time random flow to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting velocity field features an interplay between the roughness exponent $\xi\in(0,2]$, controlling the correlation decay for the Gaussian component, and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in [0,\sqrt {2}/2)$, prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. Recent numerical work by the authors suggests that such coupling induce a smoothing-by-intermittency effect, and the purpose here is to address this phenomenon theoretically. Using the theory of 1D Feller Markov processes, we characterize the phases of the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$, extending to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic and colliding/non-colliding transitions known in the monofractal Kraichnan case. Our analysis distinguishes between two settings: quenched or annealed. In the quenched setting, the GMC realization is prescribed, and we show that the phases are governed by the most probable H\"older exponent of the multifractal velocity field. In the annealed setting, the GMC is averaged over, leading to an additional smoothing effect. Moreover, we show that the separation process exhibits structural analogies with multiplicative one-dimensional versions of the Liouville Brownian motion (LBM)--a diffusion process evolving in a random GMC landscape, originally introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both the quenched and annealed phase transitions are recovered by considering a multiplicative LBM characterized by a roughness parameter $\xi + 4\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Categorifying Clifford QCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. Notably, because the Pedersen--Weibel category depends only on the large-scale (coarse) structure of the metric space, so too does the classification of Clifford QCAs. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problem and long-time asymptotics to the combined Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa and short-pulse equation on the line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach to the Cauchy problem for the combined Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa and short-pulse (WKI-SP) equation. The solution of the Cauchy problem is first expressed in terms of the solution of a RH problem with direct scattering transform based on the Lax pair. Further through a series of deformations to the RH problem by using the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of Deift-Zhou steepest descent method, we obtain the long-time asymptotic approximations to the solution of the WKI-SP equation under a new scale $(y,t)$ in three kinds of space-time regions. The first asymptotic result from the space-time regions $ \xi:=y/t &lt;-2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta}, \alpha\beta&gt;0$ and $|\xi|&lt;\infty,\alpha\beta&lt;0$ with saddle points on $\mathbb{R}$, is characterized with solitons and soliton-radiation interaction with residual error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. The second asymptotic result from the region $ \xi &gt;-2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta}, \alpha\beta&gt;0$ without saddle point on $\mathbb{R}$, is characterized with modulation-solitons with residual error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$; These two results above are a verification of the soliton resolution conjecture for the WKI-SP equation. The third asymptotic result from a transition region $\xi \approx -2\sqrt{3\alpha\beta},\alpha\beta&gt;0$ can be expressed in terms of the solution of the Painlev\'{e} \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} equation with error $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$. This is a new phenomena that the long-time asymptotics for the solution to the Cauchy problem of the WKI equation and SP equation don't possesses.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Time in Topological Quantum Gravity of the Ricci Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of topological nonrelativistic quantum gravity associated with a family of Ricci flow equations on Riemannian manifolds. This topological gravity is of the cohomological type, and it exhibits an ${\cal N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. In our previous work, we constructed this theory in a two-step procedure in the appropriate nonrelativistic ${\cal N}=2$ superspace, first presenting a topological theory of the spatial metric $g_{ij}$, and then adding the superspace versions of the lapse and shift variables $n$ and $n^i$ while gauging the symmetries of foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms. In the relation to Perelman's theory of the Ricci flow, the role of Perelman's dilaton is played by our nonprojectable lapse. Here we demonstrate that this construction is equivalent to a standard one-step BRST gauge-fixing of a theory whose fields are $g_{ij}$, $n^i$ and $n$, and whose gauge symmetries consist of (i) the topological deformations of $g_{ij}$, and (ii) the ultralocal nonrelativistic limit of spacetime diffeomorphisms. The supercharge $Q$ of our superspace construction plays the role of the BRST charge. The spacetime diffeomorphism symmetries appear in an interestingly "shifted" form, which may be of broader interest for nonrelativistic quantum gravity outside of the present topological context. In contrast to the foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms, the gauge symmetries identified in this paper act nonprojectably on time, making it clear that this theory has no local propagating degrees of freedom. We point out an intriguing dual interpretation of the same theory, as a gauge fixing of a dual copy of ultralocal spacetime diffeomorphisms, with the role of ghosts and antighosts interchanged and the second supercharge $\bar Q$ of the ${\cal N}=2$ superalgebra playing the role of the BRST charge in the dual picture.</description>

      <title>About the (in)equivalence between holonomic versus non-holonomic theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scenarios in which a holonomic versus a non-holonomic frame description of gravity theories are equivalent. It turns out that classically, the equivalence holds in a way that is independent of the particular dynamics and/or spacetime dimension. This includes general metric-affine dynamics. A global bundle-theoretical investigation is carried out, uncovering the equivalence principle as the culprit. The equivalence holds as long as the equivalence principle holds. This is not something to be expected when non-invertible configurations of the vielbein field are taken into account. In such case, the gauge-theoretical description of gravity unsolders from spacetime, and one has to decide if gravity is spacetime geometry or an internal gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing the generalized divergence of $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are non-PPT (NPT), establishing their faithfulness for the resource theory of NPT entanglement. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of quantum states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of the vacuum projector $|0 \rangle \langle 0| $ and of the unitary Weyl operators enables us to construct a set of Hermitian dichotomic operators in relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski spacetime. Employing test functions supported in diamond regions, both Bell and Mermin inequalities are studied by means of a numerical setup. In addition to reporting expressive violations of both inequalities, the cluster property is also checked.</description>

      <title>Hard edge asymptotics of correlation functions between singular values and eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any square complex matrix of size $n\times n$ can be partially characterized by its $n$ eigenvalues and/or $n$ singular values. While no one-to-one correspondence exists between those two kinds of values on a deterministic level, for random complex matrices drawn from a bi-unitarily invariant ensemble, a bijection exists between the underlying singular value ensemble and the corresponding eigenvalue ensemble. This enabled the recent finding of an explicit formula for the joint probability density between $1$ eigenvalue and $k$ singular values, coined $1,k$-point function. We derive here the large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin (hard edge) for a large subclass of bi-unitarily invariant ensembles called polynomial ensembles and its subclass P\'olya ensembles. This latter subclass contains all Meijer-G ensembles and, in particular, Muttalib-Borodin ensembles and the classical Wishart-Laguerre (complex Ginibre), Jacobi (truncated unitary), Cauchy-Lorentz ensembles. We show that the latter three ensembles share the same asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin. In the case of Jacobi ensembles, there exists another hard edge for the singular values, namely the upper edge of their support, which corresponds to a soft edge for the eigenvalue (soft-hard edge). We give the explicit large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around this soft-hard edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles that are stochastically scattered or transmitted upon collision by identifying the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolates between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in the limit of pure transmission.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and structure constants of E-series minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the ADE classification of Virasoro minimal models, the E-series is the sparsest: their central charges $c=1-6\frac{(p-q)^2}{pq}$ are not dense in the half-line $c\in (-\infty,1)$, due to $q=12,18,30$ taking only 3 values -- the Coxeter numbers of $E_6, E_7, E_8$. The E-series is also the least well understood, with few known results beyond the spectrum.
  Here, we use a semi-analytic bootstrap approach for numerically computing 4-point correlation functions. We deduce non-chiral fusion rules, i.e. which 3-point structure constants vanish. These vanishings can be explained by constraints from null vectors, interchiral symmetry, simple currents, extended symmetries, permutations, and parity, except in one case for $q=30$. We conjecture that structure constants are given by a universal expression built from the double Gamma function, times polynomial functions of $\cos(\pi\frac{p}{q})$ with values in $\mathbb{Q}\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{q})\big)$, which we work out explicitly for $q=12$.
  We speculate on generalizing E-series minimal models to generic integer values of $q$, and recovering loop CFTs as $p,q\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants and Large Gauge Effects in Flat and AdS Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As in other partial differential equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions when one integrates Einstein's equations, or more generally field equations of any other gravity. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can, in principle, be measured is a non-trivial matter. Concentrating on the case of constants, one usually identifies them as conserved mass, momentum, angular momentum, center of mass, or some other hairs of the solution. This can be done via the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)-type construction based on pure geometry, and the solution is typically a black hole. Hence, one talks about the black hole mass and angular momentum, etc. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings: First of all, the physical interpretation of the constants of a given geometry depends not only on pure geometry, i.e. the metric, but also on the theory under consideration. This becomes quite important, especially when there is a cosmological constant. Secondly, one usually assigns the maximally symmetric spacetime, say the flat or the (anti)-de Sitter spacetime, to have zero mass and angular momentum and linear momentum. This declares the maximally symmetric spacetime to be the vacuum of the theory, but such an assignment depends on the coordinates in the ADM-type constructions and their extensions: in fact, one can introduce large gauge transformations (new coordinates) which map, say, the flat spacetime to flat spacetime but the resultant flat spacetime can have a nontrivial mass and angular momentum, if the new coordinates are such that the metric components do not decay properly. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor, will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian chaos and unique ergodicity for stochastic primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the stochastic 3D primitive equations (PEs) with non-degenerate noise is chaotic, i.e., the corresponding top Lyapunov exponent is strictly positive almost surely. This result builds on the landmark work by Bedrossian, Blumenthal, and Punshon-Smith on Lagrangian chaos in stochastic fluid mechanics. Our primary contribution is establishing an instance where Lagrangian chaos can be proven for a fluid flow with supercritical energy, a key characteristic of 3D fluid dynamics. For the 3D PEs, establishing the existence of the top Lyapunov exponent is already a challenging task. We address this difficulty by deriving new estimates for the invariant measures of the 3D PEs, which capture the anisotropic smoothing in the dynamics of the PEs. As a by-product of our results, we also obtain the first uniqueness result for invariant measures of stochastic PEs.</description>

      <title>Fractional Time-Delayed differential equations: Applications in Cosmological Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional differential equations model processes with memory effects, providing a realistic perspective on complex systems. We examine time-delayed differential equations, discussing first-order and fractional Caputo time-delayed differential equations. We derive their characteristic equations and solve them using the Laplace transform. We derive a modified evolution equation for the Hubble parameter incorporating a viscosity term modeled as a function of the delayed Hubble parameter within Eckart's theory. We extend this equation using the last-step method of fractional calculus, resulting in Caputo's time-delayed fractional differential equation. This equation accounts for the finite response times of cosmic fluids, resulting in a comprehensive model of the Universe's behavior. We then solve this equation analytically. Due to the complexity of the analytical solution, we also provide a numerical representation. Our solution reaches the de Sitter equilibrium point. Additionally, we present some generalizations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis'--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as "sandwich conditions": The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>
