      <title>Proof of Sampling: A Nash Equilibrium-Secured Verification Protocol for Decentralized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a secure and versatile sampling-based verification protocol, Proof of Sampling (PoSP) protocol, suitable for a wide range of decentralized applications. Our protocol has a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, which compels rational participants to act honestly, thus fortifying the network's integrity. This design effectively eliminates the possibility of free-riding, achieving this with manageable computational overhead. When applied to decentralized inference for AI applications, we design spML based on PoSP protocol, which ingeniously amalgamates the strengths of optimistic fraud proof and zero knowledge proof based approaches, the foremost approaches in the domain at present. Within the realm of Layer 2 solutions, our protocol sp-rollups addresses the security vulnerabilities of current optimistic rollups, which include a risk of undetected fraud due to reliance on mixed strategy equilibria, all the while keeping the computational overhead within reasonable bounds. Moreover, the PoSP protocol can be effectively utilized for designing verification mechanisms within Actively Validated Services (AVS) in EigenLayer, further broadening its applicability. This innovative approach not only enhances the security and efficiency of decentralized systems but also paves the way for a new generation of scalable and reliable decentralized applications.</description>

      <title>The Set of Stable Matchings and the Core in a Matching Market with Ties and Matroid Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a many-to-one matching market where ties in the preferences of agents are allowed. For this market with capacity constraints, Bonifacio, Juarez, Neme, and Oviedo proved some relationship between the set of stable matchings and the core. In this paper, we consider a matroid constraint that is a generalization of a capacity constraint. We prove that the results proved by Bonifacio, Juarez, Neme, and Oviedo can be generalized to this setting.</description>

      <title>Dual-Role AoI-based Incentive Mechanism for HD map Crowdsourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-quality fresh high-definition (HD) map is vital in enhancing transportation efficiency and safety in autonomous driving. Vehicle-based crowdsourcing offers a promising approach for updating HD maps. However, recruiting crowdsourcing vehicles involves making the challenging tradeoff between the HD map freshness and recruitment costs. Existing studies on HD map crowdsourcing often (1) prioritize maximizing spatial coverage and (2) overlook the dual role of crowdsourcing vehicles in HD maps, as vehicles serve both as contributors and customers of HD maps. This motivates us to propose the Dual-Role Age of Information (AoI) based Incentive Mechanism (DRAIM) to address these issues. % Specifically, we propose the trajectory age of information, incorporating the expected AoI of the HD map and the trajectory, to quantify a vehicle's HD map usage utility, which is freshness- and trajectory-dependent. DRAIM aims to achieve the company's tradeoff between freshness and recruitment costs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mutual Trustworthiness in Federated Learning for Data-Rich Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a promising collaborative and privacy-preserving machine learning approach in data-rich smart cities. Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity of these urban environments presents a significant challenge in selecting trustworthy clients for collaborative model training. The usage of traditional approaches, such as the random client selection technique, poses several threats to the system's integrity due to the possibility of malicious client selection. Primarily, the existing literature focuses on assessing the trustworthiness of clients, neglecting the crucial aspect of trust in federated servers. To bridge this gap, in this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses the mutual trustworthiness in federated learning by considering the trust needs of both the client and the server. Our approach entails: (1) Creating preference functions for servers and clients, allowing them to rank each other based on trust scores, (2) Establishing a reputation-based recommendation system leveraging multiple clients to assess newly connected servers, (3) Assigning credibility scores to recommending devices for better server trustworthiness measurement, (4) Developing a trust assessment mechanism for smart devices using a statistical Interquartile Range (IQR) method, (5) Designing intelligent matching algorithms considering the preferences of both parties. Based on simulation and experimental results, our approach outperforms baseline methods by increasing trust levels, global model accuracy, and reducing non-trustworthy clients in the system.</description>

      <title>LEAP: Optimization Hierarchical Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Coalition Formation Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) utilizes edge servers (ESs) to alleviate communication burdens, its model performance will be degraded by non-IID data and limited communication resources. Current works often assume that data is uniformly distributed, which however contradicts the heterogeneity of IoT. Solutions of additional model training to check the data distribution inevitably increases computational costs and the risk of privacy leakage. The challenges in solving these issues are how to reduce the impact of non-IID data without involving raw data and how to rationalize the communication resource allocation for addressing straggler problem. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel optimization method based on coaLition formation gamE and grAdient Projection, called LEAP. Specifically, we combine edge data distribution with coalition formation game innovatively to adjust the correlations between clients and ESs dynamically, which ensures optimal correlations. We further capture the client heterogeneity to achieve the rational bandwidth allocation from coalition perception and determine the optimal transmission power within specified delay constraints at client level. Experimental results on four real datasets show that LEAP is able to achieve 20.62% improvement in model accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, LEAP effectively reduce transmission energy consumption by at least about 2.24 times.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Minimization using Multi-agent UAVs based on AI-Enhanced Mean Field Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms play an effective role in timely data collection from ground sensors in remote and hostile areas. Optimizing the collective behavior of swarms can improve data collection performance. This paper puts forth a new mean field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize age of information (AoI) of sensory data, where balancing the trade-off between the UAVs movements and AoI is formulated as a mean field game (MFG). The MFG optimization yields an expansive solution space encompassing continuous state and action, resulting in significant computational complexity. To address practical situations, we propose, a new mean field hybrid proximal policy optimization (MF-HPPO) scheme to minimize the average AoI by optimizing the UAV's trajectories and data collection scheduling of the ground sensors given mixed continuous and discrete actions. Furthermore, a long short term memory (LSTM) is leveraged in MF-HPPO to predict the time-varying network state and stabilize the training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MF-HPPO reduces the average AoI by up to 45 percent and 57 percent in the considered simulation setting, as compared to multi-agent deep Q-learning (MADQN) method and non-learning random algorithm, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Game Evaluation Framework for Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating deep multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms is complicated by stochasticity in training and sensitivity of agent performance to the behavior of other agents. We propose a meta-game evaluation framework for deep MARL, by framing each MARL algorithm as a meta-strategy, and repeatedly sampling normal-form empirical games over combinations of meta-strategies resulting from different random seeds. Each empirical game captures both self-play and cross-play factors across seeds. These empirical games provide the basis for constructing a sampling distribution, using bootstrapping, over a variety of game analysis statistics. We use this approach to evaluate state-of-the-art deep MARL algorithms on a class of negotiation games. From statistics on individual payoffs, social welfare, and empirical best-response graphs, we uncover strategic relationships among self-play, population-based, model-free, and model-based MARL methods.We also investigate the effect of run-time search as a meta-strategy operator, and find via meta-game analysis that the search version of a meta-strategy generally leads to improved performance.</description>

      <title>MF-OML: Online Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning with Occupation Measures for Large Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning for multi-agent games has attracted lots of attention recently. However, given the challenge of solving Nash equilibria for large population games, existing works with guaranteed polynomial complexities either focus on variants of zero-sum and potential games, or aim at solving (coarse) correlated equilibria, or require access to simulators, or rely on certain assumptions that are hard to verify. This work proposes MF-OML (Mean-Field Occupation-Measure Learning), an online mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of large population sequential symmetric games. MF-OML is the first fully polynomial multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for provably solving Nash equilibria (up to mean-field approximation gaps that vanish as the number of players $N$ goes to infinity) beyond variants of zero-sum and potential games. When evaluated by the cumulative deviation from Nash equilibria, the algorithm is shown to achieve a high probability regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{3/4}+N^{-1/2}M)$ for games with the strong Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, and a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(M^{11/12}+N^{- 1/6}M)$ for games with only the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, where $M$ is the total number of episodes and $N$ is the number of agents of the game. As a byproduct, we also obtain the first tractable globally convergent computational algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria of monotone mean-field games.</description>

      <title>Strategic Bidding in Knapsack Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines knapsack auctions as a method to solve the knapsack problem with incomplete information, where object values are private and sizes are public. We analyze three auction types-uniform price (UP), discriminatory price (DP), and generalized second price (GSP)-to determine efficient resource allocation in these settings. Using a Greedy algorithm for allocating objects, we analyze bidding behavior, revenue and efficiency of these three auctions using theory, lab experiments, and AI-enriched simulations. Our results suggest that the uniform-price auction has the highest level of truthful bidding and efficiency while the discriminatory price and the generalized second-price auctions are superior in terms of revenue generation. This study not only deepens the understanding of auction-based approaches to NP-hard problems but also provides practical insights for market design.</description>
