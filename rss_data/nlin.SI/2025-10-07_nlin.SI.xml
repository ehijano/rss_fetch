      <description>arXiv:2510.03435v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Asymmetric rational reductions of 2D-Toda hierarchy and a generalized Frobenius manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local bihamiltonian structures of the asymmetric rational reductions of the 2D-Toda hierarchy (RR2T) of types $(2,1)$ and $(1,2)$ at the full-dispersive level, and construct a three-dimensional generalized Frobenius manifold with non-flat unity associated with the $(2,1)$-type. Furthermore, we explicitly relate the $(2,1)$-type RR2T to the bi-graded Toda and constrained KP hierarchies via linear reciprocal and Miura-type transformations.</description>

      <title>Quasi-integrability from PT-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry is shown as the natural cause of quasi-integrability of deformed integrable models. The condition for asymptotic conservation of quasi-conserved charges appear as a direct consequence of the PT-symmetric phase of the system, ensuring definite PT-properties of the corresponding Lax pair as well as that of the anomalous contribution. This construction applies to quasi-deformations of multiple systems such as KdV, NLSE and non-local NLSE.</description>

      <title>Field observation of soliton gases in the deep open ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soliton gases are large ensembles of random solitons with distinct characteristics arising from integrable system dynamics. They have been widely studied in theory and experiments, and were observed in natural lagoons. However, it remains an open question whether they occur naturally in the open ocean. Nonlinear ocean states containing solitons have been observed in the literature, but the dominance of solitons over other wave components required for a soliton gas has not been demonstrated. Our study provides the first field evidence of soliton gas sea states in the deep ocean, measured in Taiwan waters. The soliton energy ratio derived from the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) is employed as a key parameter to quantify how close sea states are to soliton gases. We identify eleven measurements with extremely high soliton energy ratios. They are characterized by short-period waves with relatively small wave heights, accompanied by extreme steepness and Benjamin-Feir Index (BFI) values. These states are exceptionally rare, representing only 0.054 percent of our dataset. Since directional interference can artificially increase the soliton energy ratio, we furthermore apply a probabilistic directional filtering method to remove the directional interference. Three wave records from the Eluanbi station are found to retain high soliton energy ratios after the directional interference has been removed, confirming that they are indeed soliton gases.</description>

      <title>Non-crossing permutations for the KP solitons under the Gel'fand-Dickey reductions and the vertex operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a classification of the $regular$ soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy, referred to as the $KP solitons$, under the Gel'fand-Dickey $\ell$-reductions in terms of the permutation of the symmetric group. As an example, we show that the regular soliton solutions of the (good) Boussinesq equation as the 3-reduction can have $at ~most$ one resonant soliton in addition to two sets of solitons propagating in opposite directions. We also give a systematic construction of these soliton solutions for the $\ell$-reductions using the vertex operators. In particular, we show that the $non-crossing$ permutation gives the regularity condition for the soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Two sequences of fully-nonlinear evolution equations and their symmetry properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the complete Lie point symmetry algebras of two sequences of odd-order evolution equations. This includes equations that are fully-nonlinear, i.e. nonlinear in the highest derivative. Two of the equations in the sequences have recently been identified as symmetry-integrable, namely a 3rd-order equation and a 5th-order equation [Open Communications in Nonlinear Mathematical Physics, Special Issue in honour of George W Bluman, ocnmp:15938, 1--15, 2025]. These two examples provided the motivation for the current study. The Lie-B\"acklund symmetries and the consequent symmetry-integrability of the equations in the sequences are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the correspondence between classical and quantum integrable theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If we start from certain functional relations as definition of a quantum integrable theory, then we can derive from them a linear integral equation. It can be extended, by introducing dynamical variables, to become an equation with the form of Marchenko's. Then, we derive from the latter a classical (differential) Lax pair. We exemplify our method by focusing on the massive version of the ODE/IM (Ordinary Differential Equations/Integrable Models) correspondence from Quantum sine-Gordon (sG) with many moduli/masses to the classical sinh-Gordon (shG) equation, so describing, in a particular case, some super-symmetric gauge theories and the $AdS_3$ strong coupling scattering amplitudes/Wilson loops. Yet, we present it in a way which reveals its generality of application. In fact, we give some hints on how it works for spin chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that previous correspondence between some (integrable) statistical field theory quantities and periods of $SU(2)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ deformed gauge theory still holds if we add $N_f=1,2$ flavours of matter. Moreover, the correspondence entails a new non-perturbative solution to the theory. Eventually, we use this solution to give exact results on quasinormal modes of black branes and holes.</description>

      <title>Generalization of nonlocally related partial differential equation systems: unknown symmetric properties and analytical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry, which describes invariance, is an eternal concern in mathematics and physics, especially in the investigation of solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE). A PDE's nonlocally related PDE systems provide excellent approaches to search for various symmetries that expand the range of its known solutions. They composed of potential systems based on conservation laws and inverse potential systems (IPS) based on differential invariants. Our study is devoted to generalizing their construction and application in three-dimensional circumstances. Concretely, the potential of the algebraic gauge-constrained potential system is simplified without weakening its solution space. The potential system is extended via nonlocal conservation laws and double reductions. Afterwards, nonlocal symmetries are identified in the IPS.\@ The IPS is extended by the solvable Lie algebra and type \Rmnum{2} hidden symmetries. Besides, systems among equations can be connected via Cole-Hopf transformation.\@ Ultimately, established and extended systems embody rich symmetric properties and unprecedented analytical solutions, and may even further facilitate general coordinate-independent analysis in qualitative, numerical, perturbation, etc., this can be illustrated by several Burgers-type equations.</description>

      <title>A Martingale-Free Introduction to Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conditional Gaussian nonlinear system (CGNS) is a broad class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. Given the trajectories for a subset of state variables, the remaining follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite the conditionally linear structure, the CGNS exhibits strong nonlinearity, thus capturing many non-Gaussian characteristics observed in nature through its joint and marginal distributions. Desirably, it enjoys closed analytic formulae for the time evolution of its conditional Gaussian statistics, which facilitate the study of data assimilation and other related topics. In this paper, we develop a martingale-free approach to improve the understanding of CGNSs. This methodology provides a tractable approach to proving the time evolution of the conditional statistics by deriving results through time discretization schemes, with the continuous-time regime obtained via a formal limiting process as the discretization time-step vanishes. This discretized approach further allows for developing analytic formulae for optimal posterior sampling of unobserved state variables with correlated noise. These tools are particularly valuable for studying extreme events and intermittency and apply to high-dimensional systems. Moreover, the approach improves the understanding of different sampling methods in characterizing uncertainty. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a physics-constrained, triad-interaction climate model with cubic nonlinearity and state-dependent cross-interacting noise.</description>

      <title>Constraining all possible Korteweg-de Vries type hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current $j=\partial_-\phi$ in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. The infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras define integrable deformations of the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory which preserve the Poisson bracket structure. We study these mutually commuting subalgebras, finding general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. Along the way, we derive constraints on integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type. We also confirm that the recently found $[j]=0,-1,-2$ mutually commuting subalgebras are infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system at integer index $k$: polynomial algebras of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>
