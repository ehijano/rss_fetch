      <title>Portfolio Optimization with Robust Covariance and Conditional Value-at-Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measure of portfolio risk is an important input of the Markowitz framework. In this study, we explored various methods to obtain a robust covariance estimators that are less susceptible to financial data noise. We evaluated the performance of large-cap portfolio using various forms of Ledoit Shrinkage Covariance and Robust Gerber Covariance matrix during the period of 2012 to 2022. Out-of-sample performance indicates that robust covariance estimators can outperform the market capitalization-weighted benchmark portfolio, particularly during bull markets. The Gerber covariance with Mean-Absolute-Deviation (MAD) emerged as the top performer. However, robust estimators do not manage tail risk well under extreme market conditions, for example, Covid-19 period. When we aim to control for tail risk, we should add constraint on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to make more conservative decision on risk exposure. Additionally, we incorporated unsupervised clustering algorithm K-means to the optimization algorithm (i.e. Nested Clustering Optimization, NCO). It not only helps mitigate numerical instability of the optimization algorithm, but also contributes to lower drawdown as well.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach To Asset Allocation With Investor Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, a geometric approach to incorporating investor views in portfolio construction is presented. In particular, the proposed approach utilizes the notion of generalized Wasserstein barycenter (GWB) to combine the statistical information about asset returns with investor views to obtain an updated estimate of the asset drifts and covariance, which are then fed into a mean-variance optimizer as inputs. Quantitative comparisons of the proposed geometric approach with the conventional Black-Litterman model (and a closely related variant) are presented. The proposed geometric approach provides investors with more flexibility in specifying their confidence in their views than conventional Black-Litterman model-based approaches. The geometric approach also rewards the investors more for making correct decisions than conventional BL based approaches. We provide empirical and theoretical justifications for our claim.</description>

      <title>An adaptive volatility method for probabilistic forecasting and its application to the M6 financial forecasting competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of probabilistic forecasting using an adaptive volatility method rooted in classical time-varying volatility models and leveraging online stochastic optimization algorithms. These principles were successfully applied in the M6 forecasting competition under the team named AdaGaussMC. Our approach takes a unique path by embracing the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) instead of trying to beat the market directly. We focus on evaluating the efficient market, emphasizing the importance of online forecasting in adapting to the dynamic nature of financial markets. The three key points of our approach are: (a) apply the univariate time-varying volatility model AdaVol, (b) obtain probabilistic forecasts of future returns, and (c) optimize the competition metrics using stochastic gradient-based algorithms. We contend that the simplicity of our approach contributes to its robustness and consistency. Remarkably, our performance in the M6 competition resulted in an overall 7th ranking, with a noteworthy 5th position in the forecasting task. This achievement, considering the perceived simplicity of our approach, underscores the efficacy of our adaptive volatility method in the realm of probabilistic forecasting.</description>
