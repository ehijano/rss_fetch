      <title>The Simultaneous Interval Number: A New Width Parameter that Measures the Similarity to Interval Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel way of generalizing the class of interval graphs, via a graph width parameter called the simultaneous interval number. This parameter is related to the simultaneous representation problem for interval graphs and defined as the smallest number $d$ of labels such that the graph admits a $d$-simultaneous interval representation, that is, an assignment of intervals and label sets to the vertices such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding intervals, as well as their label sets, intersect. We show that this parameter is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to compute and give several bounds for the parameter, showing in particular that it is sandwiched between pathwidth and linear mim-width. For classes of graphs with bounded parameter values, assuming that the graph is equipped with a simultaneous interval representation with a constant number of labels, we give $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms for the clique, independent set, and dominating set problems, and hardness results for the independent dominating set and coloring problems. The $\mathsf{FPT}$ results for independent set and dominating set are for the simultaneous interval number plus solution size. In contrast, both problems are known to be $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard for linear mim-width plus solution size.</description>

      <title>Computing with Hypergeometric-Type Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Take a multiplicative monoid of sequences in which the multiplication is given by Hadamard product. The set of linear combinations of interleaving monoid elements then yields a ring. We consider such a construction for the monoid of hypergeometric sequences, yielding what we call the ring of hypergeometric-type sequences -- a subring of the ring of holonomic sequences. We present two algorithms in this setting: one for computing holonomic recurrence equations from hypergeometric-type normal forms and the other for finding products of hypergeometric-type terms. These are newly implemented commands in our Maple package $\texttt{HyperTypeSeq}$, which we also describe.</description>

      <title>Complexity and algorithms for Arc-Kayles and Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arc-Kayles is a game where two players alternate removing two adjacent vertices until no move is left. Introduced in 1978, its computational complexity is still open. More recently, subtraction games, where the players cannot disconnect the graph while removing vertices, were introduced. In particular, Arc-Kayles admits a non-disconnecting variant that is a subtraction game. We study the computational complexity of subtraction games on graphs, proving that they are PSPACE-complete even on very structured graph classes (split, bipartite of any even girth). We prove that Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles can be solved in polynomial-time on unicyclic graphs, clique trees, and subclasses of threshold graphs. We also show that a sufficient condition for a second player-win on Arc-Kayles is equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Bit catastrophes for the Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bit catastrophe, loosely defined, is when a change in just one character of a string causes a significant change in the size of the compressed string. We study this phenomenon for the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), a string transform at the heart of several of the most popular compressors and aligners today. The parameter determining the size of the compressed data is the number of equal-letter runs of the BWT, commonly denoted $r$.
  We exhibit infinite families of strings in which insertion, deletion, resp. substitution of one character increases $r$ from constant to $\Theta(\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string. These strings can be interpreted both as examples for an increase by a multiplicative or an additive $\Theta(\log n)$-factor. As regards multiplicative factor, they attain the upper bound given by Akagi, Funakoshi, and Inenaga [Inf &amp; Comput. 2023] of $O(\log n \log r)$, since here $r=O(1)$.
  We then give examples of strings in which insertion, deletion, resp. substitution of a character increases $r$ by a $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ additive factor. These strings significantly improve the best known lower bound for an additive factor of $\Omega(\log n)$ [Giuliani et al., SOFSEM 2021].</description>

      <title>A Fast 3-Approximation for the Capacitated Tree Cover Problem with Edge Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capacitated tree cover problem with edge loads is a variant of the tree cover problem, where we are given facility opening costs, edge costs and loads, as well as vertex loads. We try to find a tree cover of minimum cost such that the total edge and vertex load of each tree does not exceed a given bound. We present an $\mathcal{O}(m\log n)$ time 3-approximation algorithm for this problem.
  This is achieved by starting with a certain LP formulation. We give a combinatorial algorithm that solves the LP optimally in time $\mathcal{O}(m\log n)$. Then, we show that a linear time rounding and splitting technique leads to an integral solution that costs at most 3 times as much as the LP solution. Finally, we prove that the integrality gap of the LP is $3$, which shows that we can not improve the rounding step in general.</description>

      <title>Closeness and Residual Closeness of Harary Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of a network in terms of vulnerability is one of the most significant problems. Graph theory serves as a valuable tool for solving complex network problems, and there exist numerous graph-theoretic parameters to analyze the system's stability. Among these parameters, the closeness parameter stands out as one of the most commonly used vulnerability metrics. Its definition has evolved to enhance the ease of formulation and applicability to disconnected structures. Furthermore, based on the closeness parameter, vertex residual closeness, which is a newer and more sensitive parameter compared to other existing parameters, has been introduced as a new graph vulnerability index by Dangalchev. In this study, the outcomes of the closeness and vertex residual closeness parameters in Harary Graphs have been examined. Harary Graphs are well-known constructs that are distinguished by having $n$ vertices that are $k$-connected with the least possible number of edges.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rikicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06177v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. It is often believed that heterophilous graphs are challenging for standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), and much effort has been put into developing efficient methods for this setting. However, there is no universally agreed-upon measure of homophily in the literature. In this work, we show that commonly used homophily measures have critical drawbacks preventing the comparison of homophily levels across different datasets. For this, we formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and verify which measures satisfy which properties. In particular, we show that a measure that we call adjusted homophily satisfies more desirable properties than other popular homophily measures while being rarely used in graph machine learning literature. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new characteristic that allows one to further distinguish different sorts of heterophily. The proposed label informativeness (LI) characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We prove that this measure satisfies important desirable properties. We also observe empirically that LI better agrees with GNN performance compared to homophily measures, which confirms that it is a useful characteristic of the graph structure.</description>

      <title>Twin-width of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the twin-width of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$. We unveil a surprising behavior of this parameter by showing the existence of a constant $p^*\approx 0.4$ such that with high probability, when $p^*\le p\le 1-p^*$, the twin-width is asymptotically $2p(1-p)n$, whereas, when $0&lt;p&lt;p^*$ or $1&gt;p&gt;1-p^*$, the twin-width is significantly higher than $2p(1-p)n$. In addition, we show that the twin-width of $G(n,1/2)$ is concentrated around $n/2 - \sqrt{3n \log n}/2$ within an interval of length $o(\sqrt{n\log n})$. For the sparse random graph, we show that with high probability, the twin-width of $G(n,p)$ is $\Theta(n\sqrt{p})$ when $(726\ln n)/n\leq p\leq1/2$.</description>

      <title>Sumsets in the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of the Boolean hypercube $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a sumset if $S = A+A = \{a + b \ | \ a, b\in A\}$ for some $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$. We prove that the number of sumsets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is asymptotically $(2^n-1)2^{2^{n-1}}$. Furthermore, we show that the family of sumsets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is almost identical to the family of all subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ that contain a complete linear subspace of co-dimension $1$.</description>
