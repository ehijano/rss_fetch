      <title>Global Plane Waves From Local Gaussians: Periodic Charge Densities in a Blink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ELECTRAFI, a fast, end-to-end differentiable model for predicting periodic charge densities in crystalline materials. ELECTRAFI constructs anisotropic Gaussians in real space and exploits their closed-form Fourier transforms to analytically evaluate plane-wave coefficients via the Poisson summation formula. This formulation delegates non-local and periodic behavior to analytic transforms, enabling reconstruction of the full periodic charge density with a single inverse FFT. By avoiding explicit real-space grid probing, periodic image summation, and spherical harmonic expansions, ELECTRAFI matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy across periodic benchmarks while being up to $633 \times$ faster than the strongest competing method, reconstructing crystal charge densities in a fraction of a second. When used to initialize DFT calculations, ELECTRAFI reduces total DFT compute cost by up to ~20%, whereas slower charge density models negate savings due to high inference times. Our results show that accuracy and inference cost jointly determine end-to-end DFT speedups, and motivate our focus on efficiency.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Applied to Materials Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were proposed as an alternative to traditional neural network architectures based on multilayer perceptrons (MLP-NNs). The potential advantages of KANs over MLP-NNs, including significantly enhanced parameter efficiency and increased interpretability, make them a promising new regression model in supervised machine learning problems. We apply KANs to prediction of materials properties, focusing on a diverse set of 33 properties consisting of both experimental and calculated data. We compare the KAN results to random forest, a method that generally gives excellent performance on a wide range of properties predictions with very little optimization. The KANs were worse, on par, or better than random forest about 35%, 60%, and 5% of the time, respectively, and KANs are in practice more difficult to fit than random forest. By tuning the network architecture, we found property fits often resulted in 10-20% lower errors compared to the standard KAN, and typically gave results comparable to random forest. In the specific context of predicting reactor pressure vessel transition temperature shifts, we explored the parameter efficiency and the interpretable power of KANs by comparing predictions of simple KAN models (e.g., &lt; 50 parameters) and closed-form expressions suggested by the KAN fits to previously published deep MLP-NNs and hand-tuned models created using domain expertise of embrittlement physics. We found that simple KAN models and the resulting closed-form expressions produce prediction errors on par with established hand-tuned models with a comparable number of parameters, and required essentially no domain expertise to produce. These findings reinforce the potential applicability of KANs for machine learning in materials science and suggest that KANs should be explored as a regression model for prediction of materials properties.</description>

      <title>Establishing Atomic Coherence in Twisted Oxide Membranes Containing Volatile Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20108v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted oxide membranes represent a promising platform for exploring moire physics and emergent quantum phenomena. However, the presence of amorphous interfacial dead layers in conventional oxide heterostructures impedes coherent coupling and suppresses moire-induced interactions. While high-temperature thermal treatments can facilitate interfacial bonding, additional care is needed for materials containing volatile elements, where elevated temperatures may cause elemental loss. This study demonstrates the realization of atomically coherent, chemically bonded interface in twisted NaNbO3 heterostructures through controlled oxygen-annealing treatment. Atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy reveal ordered perovskite registry accompanied by systematic lattice contraction and modified electronic structure at the twisted interface, providing signatures of chemical reconstruction rather than physical adhesion. This reconstructed interface mediates highly asymmetric strain propagation in which the bottom membrane remains nearly relaxed while the top membrane accommodates substantial shear strain, thereby establishing a strain gradient that enables long-range electromechanical coupling throughout the twisted oxide membranes. By resolving the nature of the reconstructed interface, these findings establish a robust pathway for achieving coherent and strain-tunable oxide moire superlattices, opening pathways to engineer emergent ferroic and electronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Vibrational and Electronic Properties of Np2O5 from Experimental Spectroscopy and First Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-valence actinide oxides are critical to understanding the behavior of 5f-electrons, yet their structural and electronic properties remain poorly understood due to challenges in synthesis and handling. We report the first Raman spectroscopic study of single-crystalline Np2O5 and the first scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurement on any neptunium-containing material. Hydrothermally synthesized crystals were structurally verified by X-ray diffraction. Raman spectra revealed sharply resolved vibrational features, including previously unreported low-frequency modes. STS measurements revealed a band gap of 1.5 eV. Density functional theory (DFT) enables vibrational mode assignments, reveals neptunium-dominated low-frequency phonons, oxygen-dominated high-frequency modes, and predicts an indirect band gap of 1.68 eV. This predicted value is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured STS gap. This combined Raman, DFT, and STS approach provides a robust framework for correlating lattice dynamics and electronic structure in actinide materials, providing benchmark data for Np2O5, and opening new avenues for probing structure-property relationships in complex f-electron materials.</description>

      <title>ALD-Derived WO3-x Leads to Nearly Wake-Up-Free Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 at Elevated Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking the memory wall in advanced computing architectures will require complex 3D integration of emerging memory materials such as ferroelectrics-either within the back-end-of-line (BEOL) of CMOS front-end processes or through advanced 3D packaging technologies. Achieving this integration demands that memory materials exhibit high thermal resilience, with the capability to operate reliably at elevated temperatures such as 125C, due to the substantial heat generated by front-end transistors. However, silicon-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectrics tend to exhibit antiferroelectric-like behavior in this temperature range, accompanied by a more pronounced wake-up effect, posing significant challenges to their thermal reliability. Here, we report that by introducing a thin tungsten oxide (WO3-x) layer-known as an oxygen reservoir-and carefully tuning its oxygen content, ultra-thin Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (5 nm) films can be made robust against the ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric transition at elevated temperatures. This approach not only minimizes polarization loss in the pristine state but also effectively suppresses the wake-up effect, reducing the required wake-up cycles from 105 to only 10 at 125C- a qualifying temperature for back-end memory integrated with front-end logic, as defined by the JEDEC standard. First-principles density functional theory calculations reveal that WO3 enhances the stability of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase at elevated temperatures by increasing the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase energy gap, and promoting favorable phonon mode evolution, thereby supporting o-phase formation under both thermodynamic and kinetic constraints.</description>

      <title>Tuning field amplitude to minimise heat-loss variability in magnetic hyperthermia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically investigate how shape-induced anisotropy dispersion and magnetic field amplitude jointly control both the magnitude and heterogeneity of heating in magnetite nanoparticle assemblies under AC magnetic fields. Using real time Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations with thermal fluctuations, and a macrospin model that includes both the intrinsic cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a shape-induced uniaxial contribution, we analyze shape-polydisperse systems under clinically and technologically relevant field conditions. We show that for relatively large particles, around 25 to 30 nm, the relative dispersion of local (single-particle) losses exhibits a well-defined minimum at moderate field amplitudes (between 4 to 12 mT), hence identifying an optimal operating regime that minimizes heating heterogeneity while maintaining substantial power dissipation. The position of this critical field depends mainly on particle size and excitation frequency, and only weakly on shape dispersion, offering practical guidelines for improving heating uniformity in realistic MFH systems.</description>

      <title>Contrasting impurity-induced magnetism and dynamics in 2H-MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of interstitial $^8$Li$^+$ implanted near the surface of 2H-MoTe$_2$ using $\beta$-detected NMR. We find that, unlike the muon, $^8$Li$^+$ does not show any signature of induced magnetism. This result is consistent with density functional theory, which identifies the Li stopping site at the 2a Wyckoff position in the van der Waals gap and confirms the absence of detectable Li-induced electronic spin polarization. Both the spin-lattice relaxation and the resonance lines show evidence of strong spin dynamics above $\sim 200$ K, reminiscent of local stochastic $^8$Li$^+$ motion within a cage. The resonance line shape consists of quadrupolar satellites on top of a broad central peak. To better understand the interaction of $^8$Li$^+$ with the host material, we employ a frequency-comb measurement, by simultaneously exciting four frequencies corresponding to the first-order quadrupolar satellite transitions, $\nu_0 \pm 3\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ and $\nu_0 \pm\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ around the Larmor frequency $\nu_0$ as a function of $\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$. This offers an enhanced sensitivity to the quadrupolar split portion of the line. Using this method, we find a small decrease of the quadrupolar frequency with increasing temperature, showing the typical behavior associated with thermally excited phonons and the absence of any magnetic response which was observed with other defects in 2H-MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Topological-transition-driven Giant Enhancement of Second-harmonic Generation in Ferroelectric Bismuth Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between band topology and light in condensed materials could unlock intriguing nonlinear optical phenomena, enabling modern photonic technologies such as quantum light sources and sub-wavelength topological lasers. Here, we unveil that a buckling-tuned topological transition in ferroelectric bismuth monolayer unleashes a giant second-harmonic generation. Using first-principles calculations, we surprisingly find that ferroelectric bismuth monolayer with a buckling parameter, $\Delta h$, has a large susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ on the order of $10^{7}$ $\mathrm{pm}^2/\mathrm{V}$, exceeding monolayer MoS$_2$ by about two orders of magnitude. When $\Delta h$ is engineered to the critical window where Dirac electrons emerge, a low-frequency resonance appears, boosting $\chi^{(2)}$ by an additional order of magnitude. We show that this enhancement is localized on the Dirac cones and dominated by intraband modification contributions. Based on an extended Dirac model, we establish that this enhancement physically originates from the ultralight effective masses $m^{*}$ of Dirac electrons through scaling with the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and band gap $E_g$. Our findings provide a general paradigm for achieving exceptional second-harmonic generation via engineering topological criticality, and could serve as an experimental signature of Dirac electrons in topological materials.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Ni/Cu Superlattice Nanowires with Atomically Sharp Interfaces for Spin Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of microstructure increases when decreasing the size of an object to the nanoscale, along with the complexity of controlling it. For instance, it is particularly complicated to create nano-object with controlled interfaces. Therefore, progressing towards 1D epitaxial nanostructures poses a challenge, and realization of their full potential is linked to technological issues of achieving large-scale, precise atom stacking of two or more different chemical elements. Achieving such coherent, epitaxial interfaces is a key step toward enabling spintronic phenomena in 1D objects, by minimizing interface scattering and strain-driven defects. Our results demonstrate a successful realization of controlled nanoscale heteroepitaxy in one-dimensional single-crystal structures. We fabricated nanowires composed of alternating magnetic (nickel) and non-magnetic, highly conductive (copper) segments. This periodic stacking modulates electron transport under magnetic stimuli. The epitaxial precision achieved eliminates detrimental electron scattering that has historically limited the magnetotransport properties of such 1D structures and hindered their development. Such materials are crucial for further advancements in the miniaturisation of nanosensors, actuators, and next-generation 3D spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Silicon Driven Facet Regulation Enables Tunable Micro-Diamond Architectures in Liquid Ga In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an ambient pressure liquid metal assisted CVD strategy that enables shape programmable growth of micro scale diamond by coupling liquid metl Ga In with ferrocene (Fe(C5H5)2) as an carbon precursor, nanodiamond seeds, and nanosilicon. Building on liquid metal diamond synthesis, this approach pushes liquid metal growth toward a low temperature (900 {\deg}C, 1 atm) while enabling single crystal diamonds to be scaled from ~10 {\mu}m to several tens of micrometers with well developed faceting. Ferrocene decomposition supplies a sustained interfacial carbon flux that is captured and redistributed by the Ga In melt toward seed rich liquid solid interfaces. Defect rich nanodiamond provides the crystallographic template required for reliable sp3 nucleation despite the intrinsically low carbon solubility of Ga In. Nanosilicon plays a distinct, complementary role by tuning interfacial kinetics and facet competition, enabling deliberate control of crystal habit: cubic (~10 {\mu}m), truncated tetrahedral, and fully faceted octahedral diamonds are reproducibly obtained by adjusting the nanosilicon:nanodiamond ratio, with octahedral crystals reaching ~50 {\mu}m. Importantly, crystal size is further scaled by regulating hydrogen flow: lowering the H2 rate increases net carbon retention at the liquid metal interface, raises effective supersaturation, and accelerates diamond deposition. Together, habit control (via nanosilicon: nanodiamond) and size scaling (via H2 flow) establish a practical route silicon driven facet regulation and size under ambient pressure, offering a pathway to tunable micro sized single crystal diamonds under mild conditions.</description>

Abstract: The remarkable advances achieved in two-dimensional materials are now being directly transposed to low-dimensional oxides. Here we show using first-principles-based atomistic simulations that ultrathin freestanding ferroelectric layers host a rich variety of polar states, from liquid-like ferroelectric domains with long-range orientational order to helix-wave and chiral bubbles configurations reminiscent of those observed in twisted freestanding oxide layers. Time-dependent electric fields enable reversible control, revealing freestanding oxide layers as ideal platforms to explore complex polar states and their potential applications in future ferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Impact of O concentration on the thermal stability and decomposition mechanism of (Cr,Al)N compared to (Ti,Al)N thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition-dependent thermal stability of (Cr$_{0.47 \mp 0.03}$Al$_{0.53 \mp 0.03}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$ thin films with O concentrations of y = 0, 0.15, and 0.40 is investigated up to 1200 {\deg}C and then compared to (Ti$_{0.56}$Al$_{0.44}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$. X-ray diffraction reveals a thermal stability limit of 1150 {\deg}C independent of the O concentration, as witnessed by the formation of decomposition products, namely h-Cr$_{2}$N for (Cr$_{0.50}$Al$_{0.50}$)$_{0.49}$N$_{0.51}$ and c-Cr for both (Cr$_{0.48}$Al$_{0.52}$)$_{0.48}$(O$_{0.15}$N$_{0.85}$)$_{0.52}$ and (Cr$_{0.44}$Al$_{0.56}$)$_{0.46}$(O$_{0.40}$N$_{0.60}$)$_{0.54}$. Based on TEM and ERDA data, the thermal stability limit is extended to 1100 - 1150 {\deg}C. DFT calculations indicate that bond breaking limits the thermal stability. In (Cr,Al)N, N has the lowest activation energy for migration. Furthermore, the O vacancy formation energy is highest in (Cr,Al)(O,N). It has to be overcome to enable diffusion on the non-metal sublattice, which is necessary for forming decomposition products like w-AlN or c-Cr. However, once Cr-N bonds break, decomposition into h-Cr$_{2}$N and subsequent c-Cr together with N$_{2}$ is triggered. This results in N evaporation, generating sufficient non-metal vacancies that greatly enhance diffusion and render the extensive vacancy formation energies for non-metals irrelevant. This reduction of the activation energy for mass transport on the non-metal sublattice to the migration barrier causes the similar thermal stability in (Cr$_{0.47 \mp 0.03}$Al$_{0.53 \mp 0.03}$)$_{z}$(O$_{y}$N$_{1-y}$)$_{1-z}$. In contrast, Al bonds break first without creating non-metal vacancies in (Ti,Al)(O,N). Thus, the high O vacancy formation energy in (Ti,Al)(O,N) significantly increases the thermal stability compared to (Ti,Al)N as well as the here investigated films.</description>

      <title>Manipulating ferroelectricity without electrical bias: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials are established candidates for beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, owing to their non-volatile spontaneous electrical polarization. The recent boom in electric dipole texture engineering and manipulation in such materials has revealed exciting routes for controlling ferroelectric polarization, offering alternatives to the classical, sometimes challenging, application of electrical fields. In this short perspective, we shed light on electrode-free external stimuli enabling control over polar states in thin films. We bring awareness to the polarizing role of chemically-engineered surface contributions and provide insights into the combination of chemical substitution and mechanical pressure, complementing the polar state tuning capabilities readily enabled by flexoelectricity. Finally, we describe recent developments in the optical modulation of polarization. Thus, our perspective aims to stimulate the advancement of alternative means to act on polarization states and facilitate the development of ferroelectric-based applications.</description>

      <title>Universality of Type-II Multiferroicity in Monolayer Nickel Dihalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of type-II multiferroicity in monolayer NiI${_2}$ indicated a new pathway for intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling in the two-dimensional limit. However, determining whether this phenomenon is a unique anomaly or a general, chemically tunable property of the material class remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate the universality of type-II multiferroicity in the transition metal dihalides by visualizing the ferroelectric order in monolayer NiBr${_2}$. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we resolve atomic-scale ferroelectric domains and confirm their magnetoelectric origin through reciprocal manipulation experiments: reorienting magnetic order via electric fields and suppressing the electric polarization with external magnetic fields. Furthermore, we find that the multiferroic state in NiBr${_2}$ is energetically less robust than in its iodide counterpart, consistent with modified superexchange interactions and the reduced spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish the transition metal dihalides as a versatile platform where the stability of magnetoelectric phases can be engineered through chemical substitution.</description>

      <title>Morphological Stability of Metal Anodes: Roles of Solid Electrolyte Interphases (SEIs) and Desolvation Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving stable lithium metal anodes requires control over the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and desolvation kinetics. Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework integrating ion transport, desolvation, charge transfer, and SEI breakdown to predict morphological instabilities during electrodeposition. Using linear stability analysis, we identify six dimensionless parameters that govern the onset and evolution of instabilities. We show that SEI transport and desolvation rate effectively modulate apparent reaction kinetics, shifting the system toward a stable, reaction-limited regime. Extending the classical limiting current concept, we demonstrate that a thick, poorly conductive SEI and sluggish desolvation significantly reduce the limiting current. We introduce an apparent Damk\"ohler number to quantify the critical balance: suppressing diffusion-limited instabilities by reaction rate reduction, while maintaining a high limiting current. Our theory enables predictive mapping of electrodeposition morphologies across diverse materials and operating conditions, guiding the rational design of stable lithium metal anodes.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Numerical Modelling of Ultrafast Laser-Matter Interactions: Maxwell Two Temperature Model Molecular Dynamics (M-TTM-MD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical framework that couples numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) approach, Molecular Dynamics (MD), and the Two-Temperature Model (TTM) to describe ultrafast laser-matter interactions in metallic systems at the atomic scale. The proposed Maxwell-Two-Temperature Model-Molecular Dynamics (M-TTM-MD) bridges the gap between electromagnetic field propagation, electron-phonon energy exchange, and atomic motion, allowing for a self-consistent treatment of energy absorption, transport, and structural response within a unified simulation environment. The calculated electromagnetic fields incorporate dispersive dielectric properties derived using the Auxiliary Differential Equation (ADE) technique, while the electronic and lattice subsystems are dynamically coupled through spatially and temporally resolved energy exchange terms. The changes in the material topography are then reflected in the updated grid for the FDTD scheme. The developed M-TTM-MD model provides a self-consistent numerical framework that offers insights into laser-induced phenomena in metals, including energy transport and surface dynamics under extreme nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Millisecond spin coherence of electrons in semiconducting perovskites revealed by spin mode locking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long spin coherence times of carriers are essential for implementing quantum technologies using semiconductor devices for which, however, a possible obstacle is spin relaxation. For the spin dynamics, decisive features are the band structure, crystal symmetry, and quantum confinement. Perovskite semiconductors recently have come into focus of studies of their spin states, notivated by efficient optical access and potentially long-living coherence. Here, we report an electron spin coherence time $T_2$ of the order of 1 ms, measured for a bulk FA$_{0.95}$Cs$_{0.05}$PbI$_3$ lead halide perovskite crystal. Using periodic laser pulses, we synchronize the electron spin Larmor precession about an external magnetic field in an inhomogeneous ensemble, the effect known as spin mode locking. It appears as a decay of the optically created ensemble spin polarization within the dephasing time $T_2^*$ of up to 20 ns and its revival during the spin coherence time $T_2$ reaching the millisecond range. This exceptionally long spin coherence time in a bulk crystal is complemented by millisecond-long longitudinal spin relaxation times $T_1$ for electrons and holes, measured by optically-detected magnetic resonance. These long-lasting spin dynamics highlight perovskites as promising platform for the quantum devices with all-optical control.</description>

      <title>Advances in ion-doping of Ca-Mg silicate bioceramics for bone tissue engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of bioceramics as hard tissue substitutes is extensive due to their excellent biocompatible and osteogenic behaviors. Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping. It is concluded that a correct choice of dopants incorporated at the optimal concentration makes these silicates ideal bone substitutes competing or even superior to calcium phosphates (apatites) and bioglasses which are known as the most prominent bioceramics.</description>

      <title>Controlled drug delivery from chitosan-coated heparin-loaded nanopores anodically grown on nitinol shape-memory alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitinol (NiTi shape-memory alloy) is an interesting candidate in various medical applications like dental, orthopedic, and cardiovascular devices, owing to its unique mechanical behaviors and proper biocompatibility. The aim of this work is the local controlled delivery of a cardiovascular drug, heparin, loaded onto nitinol treated by electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating. In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models. Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability assay also showed the non-cytotoxicity of the samples, so that the best performance was found for the chitosan-coated samples. It is concluded that the designed drug delivery systems are promising for cardiovascular, particularly stent applications.</description>

      <title>A Surface-Scaffolded Molecular Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescent spin qubits are central building blocks of quantum technologies. Placing these qubits at surfaces maximizes coupling to nearby spins and fields, enabling nanoscale sensing and facilitating integration with photonic and superconducting devices. However, reducing the dimensions or size of established qubit systems without sacrificing the qubit performance or degrading the coherence lifetime remains challenging. Here, we introduce a surface molecular qubit formed by pentacene molecules scaffolded on a two-dimensional (2D) material, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The qubit exhibits stable fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from cryogenic to ambient conditions. With fully deuterated pentacene, the Hahn-echo coherence reaches 22 $\mu$s and further extends to 214 $\mu$s under dynamical decoupling, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow NV centers in diamond, despite being positioned directly on the surface. We map the local spin environment, resolving couplings to nearby nuclear and electron spins that can serve as auxiliary quantum resources. This platform combines true surface integration, long qubit coherence, and scalable fabrication, opening routes to quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and hybrid quantum devices. It also paves the way for a broader family of 2D material-supported molecular qubits.</description>

      <title>Optically Addressable Molecular Spins at 2D Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable spins at material surfaces have represented a long-standing ambition in quantum sensing, providing atomic resolution and quantum-limited sensitivity. However, they are constrained by a finite depth at which the quantum spins can be stabilized. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid molecular-2D architecture that realizes quantum spin sensors directly on top of the surface. By anchoring spin-active molecules onto hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we eliminate the depth of the quantum sensor while also exhibiting robust spin properties from 4~K to room temperature (RT). The Hahn-echo spin coherence time exceeds \(T_2 = 3.4~\upmu\text{s}\) at 4~K, outperforming values in bulk organic crystals and overturning the prevailing expectation that spin inevitably deteriorates upon approaching the surface. By chemically tuning the molecule through deuteration, \(T_2\) improves by more than 10-fold, and under dynamic decoupling, coherence is prolonged to the intrinsic lifetime limit, exceeding 300~\(\upmu\text{s}\). Proximal proton spins and the magnetic response of two-dimensional magnets beneath the hBN layer have been detected at RT. These molecular spins form surface quantum sensors with long coherence, optical addressability, and interfacial versatility, enabling a scalable, adaptable architecture beyond what conventional solid-state platforms offer.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Small-Angle Scattering of Polydisperse Hard Rods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning framework for modeling and analyzing the small-angle scattering data of polydisperse hard-rod systems, a widely used models for anisotropic colloidal particles. We use a variational autoencoder-based neural network to learn the mapping from the system parameters such as the volume fraction, rod length, and polydispersity, to the scattering function. The dataset for training and testing such neural network model is obtained from Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of 20,000 hard spherocylinders using the hard particle Monte Carlo package from the HOOMD-blue. Four datasets were generated, each with 5,500 pairs of system parameters and corresponding scattering functions. We use one of the dataset to investigate the feasibility of the learning, and three additional datasets with different polydisperse distribution to demonstrate the generality of our approach. The neural network model transcends the fundamental limitations of the Percus-Yevick approximation by accurately capturing anisotropic interactions and high-concentration effects that analytical models often fail to resolve. This framework achieves significantly higher accuracy in reproducing scattering functions and enables a least-square fitting routine for quantitative data analysis.</description>

      <title>Krypton-sputtered tantalum films for scalable high-performance quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits based on tantalum (Ta) thin films have demonstrated the highest-performing microwave resonators and qubits. This makes Ta an attractive material for superconducting quantum computing applications, but, so far, direct deposition has largely relied on high substrate temperatures exceeding \SI{400}{\celsius} to achieve the body-centered cubic phase, BCC (\textalpha-Ta). This leads to compatibility issues for scalable fabrication leveraging standard semiconductor fabrication lines. Here, we show that changing the sputter gas from argon (Ar) to krypton (Kr) promotes BCC Ta synthesis on silicon (Si) at temperatures as low as \SI{200}{\celsius}, providing a wide process window compatible with back-end-of-the-line fabrication standards. Furthermore, we find these films to have substantially higher electronic conductivity, consistent with clean-limit superconductivity. We validated the microwave performance through coplanar waveguide resonator measurements, finding that films deposited at \SI{250}{\celsius} and \SI{350}{\celsius} exhibit a tight performance distribution at the state of the art. Higher temperature-grown films exhibit higher losses, in correlation with the degree of Ta/Si intermixing revealed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Finally, with these films, we demonstrate transmon qubits with a relatively compact, \SI{20}{\micro\meter} capacitor gap, achieving a median quality factor up to 14 million.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic assemblies of nanoparticles are central to surface patterning, with applications in biosensing, energy conversion, and nanofabrication. Evaporation of colloidal droplets on substrates provides a simple yet effective route to achieve such assemblies. This work reports the first experimental demonstration of patterns formed through stick-slip dynamics of the three-phase contact line during evaporation of gold nanoparticle suspensions on inclined substrates. Variation in nanoparticle concentration and substrate inclination alter the balance of interfacial and gravitational forces, producing multiple stick-slip events that generate periodic stripes. Stripe density exhibits a sinusoidal dependence on inclination angle, while inter-stripe spacing remains nearly invariant. Independent control over inter-stripe spacing is achieved through adjustment of nanoparticle or surfactant concentration. These results highlight the complex interplay of gravitational and interfacial forces in directing periodic nanoparticle assembly and establish a versatile, programmable framework for surface patterning with tunable nano/microscale dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and ptychography have become mature tools for high-resolution, element-specific imaging of nanoscale structures. However, transmission geometries impose stringent constraints on sample thickness and preparation, thereby limiting investigations of extended or bulk specimens, especially in the soft X-ray region. Here, we demonstrate reflection geometry soft X-ray ptychography as a robust imaging mode. Instrumental feasibility and spatial resolution are established using a lithographically defined Siemens star and barcode test pattern on a multilayer substrate. We empirically demonstrate a full-pitch spatial resolution of ca. 45 nm from Fourier ring correlation analysis of the reconstructed object. The results highlight the potential of the reflection geometry for nondestructive X-ray studies of materials without the need for transmissive samples.</description>

      <title>SITH: A Quantum-Chemical Framework for Predicting Bond Destabilization in Stretched Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical forces can selectively destabilize chemical bonds of molecular systems, particularly in biological and synthetic polymers. While experimental and theoretical methods have advanced our understanding of mechanochemical processes, predicting where energy concentrates within a molecule remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SITH (Splitting Intramolecular Tension due to stretcHing), a novel method that decomposes the total electronic energy change of a stretched molecule into contributions from individual degrees of freedom -- such as bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals -- using numerical integration of the work-energy theorem. Unlike previous approaches that rely on harmonic approximations, SITH provides high accuracy and robustness to study the distribution of energies of stretched molecules up to a first bond cleavage. Although SITH uses 3N-6 degrees of freedom for the energy decomposition, we show that it can work even for ring structures like prolines. We apply SITH to a dataset of tripeptides and demonstrate that glycine and proline exhibit significantly different energy distributions in their Ca-C backbone bonds under tension: glycine stores more energy, making it more prone to rupture, while proline has the opposite behaviour. These findings reveal intrinsic differences in mechanochemical susceptibility across amino acids, offering more accurate predictions of bond rupture in proteins, and similarly in other (bio)polymers.

      <title>Microscopic structure of the vortex cores in granular niobium: A coherent quantum puzzle</title>

Abstract: When macroscopic quantum condensates -- superconductors, superfluids, cold atoms and ions, polaritons etc. -- are put in rotation, a quantum vortex lattice forms inside. In homogeneous type-II superconductors, each vortex has a tiny core where the superconducting gap $\Delta(r)$ is known to smoothly vanish towards the core centre on the scale of the coherence length $\xi$. The cores host quantized quasiparticle energy levels known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) bound states [Caroli {\it et al.,} Phys. Lett. v. 9, 307 (1964)]. In pure materials, the spectrum of the low-lying CdGM states has the characteristic level spacing $\sim \Delta_0^2/E_F$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy and $\Delta_0$ is the bulk gap. In disordered ones, the CdGM states shift and broaden due to scattering. Here, we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that the situation is completely different in granular Nb films, which are commonly used in superconducting electronics. In these films, in which the grains are smaller than $\xi$, the gap $\Delta$ in the quasiparticle spectrum reduces towards the vortex core centres by discrete jumps at the grain boundaries. The bound states adapt to the local environment and appear at unexpectedly high energies. Both $\Delta(r)$ and bound states form a puzzle-like spatial structure of the core, elements of which are whole grains. Our discovery shakes up the established understanding of the quantum vortex and encourages a reconsideration of the vortex motion and pinning mechanisms in granular superconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of Hubbard excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum control of the many-body wavefunction is a central challenge in quantum materials research, as it could yield a precise control knob to manipulate emergent phenomena. Floquet engineering, the coherent dressing of quantum states with periodic non-resonant optical fields, has become an important strategy for quantum control. Most applications to solid-state systems have targeted weakly interacting or single-ion states, leaving the manipulation of many-body wavefunctions largely unexplored. Here, we use Floquet engineering to achieve quantum control of a strongly correlated Hubbard exciton in the one-dimensional Mott insulator Sr$_2$CuO$_3$. A nonresonant midinfrared optical field coherently dresses the exciton wavefunction, driving its rotation between bright and dark states. We use resonant third-harmonic generation to quantify ultrafast $\pi/2$ rotations on the Bloch sphere spanned by these exciton states. Our work advances the quest towards programmable control of correlated states and exciton-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Stripe antiferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moir\'e materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moir\'e band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Field induced superconductivity in a magnetically doped two-dimensional crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic field induced superconductivity is a rare property in nature due to the sensitivity of spin-singlet Cooper pairing to time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations. However, in rare cases, an interplay between magnetic fields and ions can be engineered to bring about superconductivity at finite fields. Here we use ultra-thin LaSb$_2$ doped with dilute Ce paramagnetic impurities to demonstrate a magnetic field-induced superconducting dome in a two-dimensional crystal. The reduced dimensionality of the structure enables the use of an in-plane magnetic field to dynamically suppress spin fluctuations on the Ce-site, which leads to an anomalous enhancement of the critical temperature with increasing field. By modelling the spin scattering dynamics across the experimental parameter space, we reveal insight into the complex nature of paramagnetic impurities in magnetic fields at low temperature, and how their manipulation can result in the ability to tune between competing magnetic pair-breaking regimes. Realizing this physics in a two-dimensional crystalline setting invites the application of similar approaches to unconventional forms of superconductivity while also highlighting new experimental standards which should be employed when studying ultra-thin materials in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skutterudites are promising materials for thermoelectric and spintronics applications. Here we explore spin fluctuations in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite and their effect on its electronic structure using Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory calculations. We identify multiple magnetic and charge-disproportionated configurations, with an antiferromagnetic metallic ground state. Paramagnetic fluctuations modeled through a special quasirandom spin structure open a 61 meV gap, consistent with experiments. This state features non-degenerate spin channels and band-avoided crossings, resembling a Luttinger-compensated ferrimagnet. Mapping the electronic structure to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian fails to explain the low N\'eel temperature ($\lesssim$10 K), suggesting that factors such as stoichiometry and magnetic exchange frustration may play an important role, calling for more detailed experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Stability of Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene in Ultra-High Vacuum and in Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was investigated via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) for two different environmental conditions: ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and ambient pressure. The study is carried out by measuring the C 1s line shape evolution for two hydrogenated samples one kept in the UHV chamber and the other progressively exposed to air. In particular, the $sp^3$ relative intensity in the C 1s core-level spectrum, represented by the area ratio $\frac{sp^3}{sp^2+sp^3}$, was used as a marker for the hydrogenation-level. After four months in UHV, it resulted almost unchanged within the experimental uncertainty. Thus, a long-term stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was found, that indicates this material as a good candidate for hydrogen (or tritium) storage as long as it is kept in vacuum. On the other hand, the C 1s spectrum of the sample exposed to air shows a significant oxidation. A rapid growth up to saturation of the carbon oxides was observed with a time constant $\tau$ = 2.8 $\pm$ 1.2 hours. Finally, the re-exposure of the oxidised sample to atomic hydrogen was found to be an effective method for the recovery of hydrogenated graphene. The CH stretching mode was measured via electron energy loss spectroscopy as direct footprint of hydrogenated graphene recovery.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared LEDs based on lattice-mismatched hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunctions</title>

Abstract: Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can bridge the gap between narrow linewidth, expensive lasers and broadband, inefficient thermal globars for low-cost chemical sensing in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). However, the efficiency of III-V based mid-IR LEDs at room temperature is low, primarily limited by strong nonradiative Auger-Meitner recombination that is only partially overcome with complex quantum-engineered active regions. Here, we exploit the intrinsically low Auger Meitner recombination rates of the IV-VI semiconductors PbSe and PbSnSe, while leveraging the mature III-V platform through the fabrication of hybrid heterojunctions that mediate the ~8% lattice mismatch to GaAs. Electrically injected n-PbSe/p-GaAs LEDs emit at 3.8 um with output powers up to 400 uW under pulsed operation and a peak wall plug efficiency of 0.08% at room temperature, approaching the performance of commercial III-V LEDs at similar wavelengths. Incorporating 7% Sn extends the emission to 5 um in GeSe/PbSnSe/GaAs LEDs with output powers up to 45 uW. Notably, both devices operate despite threading dislocation densities on the order of 1e9/cm^2, underscoring the potential of hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunction architectures. We show that combining the complementary advantages of IV-VI and III-V semiconductors offers a simple and efficient mid IR optoelectronic platform for a rapidly expanding set of applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-wave excitations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials and hold promise for future information and communication technologies. Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT) with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy differences using the four-state mapping ($\Delta E$), and the other via the magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the Heisenberg model based on $\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and design of magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range. Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</description>

Abstract: We study broadband terahertz (THz) conductivity and ultrafast photoconductivity spectra in lithographically fabricated multilayer epitaxial graphene nanoribbons grown on C- face of 6H-SiC substrate. THz near-field spectroscopy reveals local conductivity variations across nanoscale structural inhomogeneities such as wrinkles and grain boundaries within the multilayer graphene. Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs) further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime. The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c &gt;$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering and to an interaction of electrons with mid-gap states.</description>

Abstract: Axial phonons, carrying angular momentum through rotational lattice vibrations, offer a promising platform for exploring phonon-magnetic coupling effects. However, how the interplay of lattice and magnetism determine the phonon angular momentum (PAM) of axial phonons remains elusive. Here, based on magnetic point group theory, we establish a symmetry framework to classify phonons in collinear magnets (e.g. ferromagnets, antiferromangets, altermagnets) into three distinct categories: ferroaxial, antiferro-nonaxial, and alteraxial phonons, which are distinguished by their different PAM patterns. Beyond the ferroaxial phonons featuring $s$-wave PAM, we reveal a complete series of alteraxial phonons, characterized by higher-order-wave PAM patterns ranging from $p$- to $j$-wave. Notably, alteraxial phonons are not limited to altermagnets, but also emerge in ferromagnets and antiferromagets. Our high-throughput search predicts hundreds of candidate magnetic materials hosting alteraxial phonons. Ab initio calculations on representative magnets further confirm the existence and distinct symmetry-enforced nodal structures of PAM in alteraxial phonons. Our work provides a complete classification for axial phonons in collinear magnetic systems and paves the way for engineering magneto-phononic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional magnetoresistance driven by nonequilibrium antiferromagnetic magnons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoresistive effects are typically symmetric under magnetization reversal. However, nonlinear spin transport can give rise to unidirectional magnetoresistance in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that the nonequilibrium magnon accumulation characterized by a finite magnon chemical potential can lead to a large and robust magnonic unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) in the weakly coupled van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4 in contact with Pt. Unlike conventional magnonic USMR driven by magnetization fluctuations, this effect persists under strong magnetic fields and low temperatures, with a pronounced peak near the spin-flip transition. The magnitude of magnonic USMR in CrPS4/Pt exceeds that of YIG/Pt by more than two orders of magnitude and surpasses the electrical USMR in metallic Ta/Co bilayers by a factor of two. The observed field and temperature dependence indicates that spin transport is dominated by magnon chemical potential gradients rather than thermal- or fluctuation-driven magnon generation. These findings establish a new mechanism for nonlinear magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic van der Waals heterostructures and open a route to magnon-based antiferromagnetic spintronic functionalities in two-terminal device geometries.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description>

      <title>Thermal Analog Computing: Application to Matrix-vector Multiplication with Inverse-designed Metastructures</title>

Abstract: The rising computational demand of modern workloads has renewed interest in energy-efficient paradigms such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A fundamental operation in these systems is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Here, we demonstrate MVM using inverse-designed metastructures that exploit heat conduction as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are obtained via density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation, achieving an accuracy $&gt;99\%$ in most cases across a pool of matrices with dimensions $2\times2$ and $3\times3$. We apply this methodology -- termed thermal analog computing -- to realize matrices relevant to practical tasks, including the discrete Fourier transform and convolutional filters. These findings open new avenues for analog information processing in thermally active environments, including temperature-gradient sensing in microelectronics and thermal control systems.</description>

      <title>AiiDA-TrainsPot: Towards automated training of neural-network interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crafting neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) remains a complex task, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce AiiDA-TrainsPot, an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs by orchestrating density-functional-theory calculations, data augmentation strategies, and classical molecular dynamics. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against ab initio reference errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of this calibrated criterion, and show that it minimizes both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to compute from first principles. AiiDA-TrainsPot has a modular design that supports multiple NNIP backends, enabling both the training of NNIPs from scratch and the fine-tuning of foundation models. We demonstrate its capabilities through automated training campaigns targeting pristine and defective carbon allotropes, including amorphous carbon, as well as structural phase transitions in monolayer $\mathrm{W_xMo_{1-x}Te_2}$ alloys.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Attosecond Control of Solid-State Harmonics by Optical Waveforms and Quantum Geometry Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13114</link>

Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides distinct, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby optimizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain modulates the total harmonic yield and specifically amplifies the perpendicular harmonic component by nearly a factor of two. This enhancement arises through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a significant reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) substantially increases the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, monotonic dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$</title>

Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$% -wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We also study magneto-optical conductivity, magnetic circular dichroism and Friedel oscillations in the $X$-wave magnets. Various analytic formulas are derived in the case of two-band Hamiltonians. This paper presents a review of recent progress together with some original results.</description>

      <title>CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or early-stage tool generation, limiting their adaptability and scalability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search, code extraction, and memory utilization; self-reflection via introspection, knowledge graph exploration, and others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Field-Effect Three-Terminal Electronic Device with an Electron Mobility Exceeding 40 Million cm^2/(Vs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and operation of a source-drain-gate three-terminal field-effect electronic device with an electron mobility exceeding $40\times 10^6$ cm$^2$ / (Vs). Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations.</description>
