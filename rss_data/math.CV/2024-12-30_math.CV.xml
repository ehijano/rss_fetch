      <title>Stationary Processes, Wiener-Granger Causality, and Matrix Spectral Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granger causality has become an indispensable tool for analyzing causal relationships between time series. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of its mathematical foundations, trace its historical development, and explore how recent computational advancements can enhance its application in various fields. We will not hesitate to present the proofs in full if they are simple and transparent. For more complex theorems on which we rely, we will provide supporting citations. We also discuss potential future directions for the method, particularly in the context of largescale data analysis.</description>

      <title>Length Distortion Of Curves Under Meromorphic Univalent Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a conformal (analytic and univalent) map defined on the open unit disk $\D$ of the complex plane $\IC$ that is continuous on the semi-circle $\partial \D^{+}=\{z\in\IC:|z|=1, {\rm{Im}}\,z&gt;0\}$. The existence of a uniform upper bound for the ratio of the length of the image of the horizontal diameter $(-1,1)$ to the length of the image of $\partial \D^{+}$ under $f$ was proved by Gehring and Hayman. In this article, at first, we generalize this result by introducing a simple pole for $f$ in $\D$ and considering the ratio of the length of the image of the vertical diameter $I=\{z: {\rm{Re}}\,z=0; ~|{\rm{Im}}\,z|&lt;1\}$ to the length of the image of the semi-circle $C'=\{z: |z|=1;~ {\rm{Re}}\,z&lt;0\}$ under such $f$. Finally, we further generalize this result by replacing the vertical diameter $I$ with a hyperbolic geodesic symmetric with respect to the real line, and by replacing $C'$ with the corresponding arc of the unit circle passing through the point $-1$.</description>

Abstract: The objective of this study is to ascertain the existence and forms of the finite order meromorphic and entire functions of several complex variables satisfying some certain Fermat-type partial differential-difference equations by considering the more general forms of the PDDEs in an open problem on $\mathbb{C}^2$ due to Xu and Wang (Notes on the existence of entire solutions for several partial differential-difference equations, Bull. Iran. Math. Soc., 47, 1477-1489 (2020)). We provide examples to illustrate the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve certain Fermat-type partial differential-difference equations for finite order entire functions of several complex variables. These results are significant generalizations of some earlier findings, especially those of Haldar and Ahamed (Entire solutions of several quadratic binomial and trinomial partial differential-difference equations in $\mathbb{C}^2$, Anal. Math. Phys., 12 (2022)). In addition, the results improve the previous results from the situation with two complex variables to the situation with several complex variables. To support our results, we have included several examples.</description>

      <title>Potential Vector Fields in $\mathbb R^3$ and $\alpha$-Meridional Mappings of the Second Kind $(\alpha \in \mathbb R)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends approach developed in a recent author's paper on analytic models of potential fields in inhomogeneous media. New three-dimensional analytic models of potential vector fields in some layered media are constructed. Properties of various analytic models in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates in $\mathbb R^3$ are compared. The original properties of the Jacobian matrix $\mathbf{J}(\vec V)$ of potential meridional fields $\vec V$ in cylindrically layered media, where $\phi( \rho) = \rho^{-\alpha}$ $(\alpha \in \mathbb R)$, lead to the concept of \emph{$\alpha$-meridional mappings of the first and second kind}. The concept of \emph{$\alpha$-Meridional functions of the first and second kind} naturally arises in this way. When $\alpha =1$, the special concept of \emph{Radially holomorphic functions in $\mathbb R^3$}, introduced by G\"{u}rlebeck, Habetha and Spr\"{o}ssig in 2008, is developed in more detail. Certain key properties of the radially holomorphic functions $G$ and functions reversed with respect to $G$ are first characterized. Surprising properties of the radially holomorphic potentials represented by superposition of the radially holomorphic exponential function $e^{\breve{\beta} x}$ $(\breve{\beta} \in \mathbb R)$ and function reversed with respect to $e^{\breve{\beta} x}$ are demonstrated explicitly. The basic properties of the radially holomorphic potential represented by the radially holomorphic extension of the Joukowski transformation in $\mathbb R^3$ are studied.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials on multiple intervals with non-analytic weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials for measures that are differentiable, but not necessarily analytic, multiplicative perturbations of Jacobi-like measures supported on disjoint intervals. We analyze the Fokas--Its--Kitaev Riemann--Hilbert problem using the Deift--Zhou method of nonlinear steepest descent and its $\overline \partial$ extension due to Miller and McLaughlin. Our results extend that of Yattselev in the case of Chebyshev-like measures with error bounds that are slightly improved while less regular perturbations are admissible. For the general Jacobi-like case, we present, what appears to be the first result for asymptotics when the perturbation of the measure is only assumed to be twice differentiable, with bounded third derivative.</description>

      <title>Additive processes on the real line and Loewner chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates additive processes with respect to several different independences in non-commutative probability in terms of the convolution hemigroups of the distributions of the increments of the processes. In particular, we focus on the relation of monotone convolution hemigroups and chordal Loewner chains, a special kind of family of conformal mappings. Generalizing the celebrated Loewner differential equation, we introduce the concept of ``generator'' for a class of Loewner chains. The locally uniform convergence of Loewner chains is then equivalent to a suitable convergence of generators. Using generators, we define homeomorphisms between the aforementioned class of chordal Loewner chains, the set of monotone convolution hemigroups with finite second moment, and the set of classical convolution hemigroups on the real line with finite second moment. Moreover, we define similar homeomorphisms between classical, free, and boolean convolution hemigroups on the real line, but without any assumptions on the moments.</description>

      <title>Inverses of integral transforms of RKHSs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fourier transform and its inverse are well-known to have complex conjugate integral kernels. S.~Saitoh demonstrated that this relationship extends to the theory of integral transforms of Hilbert spaces of functions under certain conditions. In this paper, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the inverse of an integral transform of a Hilbert space of functions to be represented by a complex conjugate integral kernel. As an application, we present an alternative proof of Plancherel's theorem using the theory of reproducing kernels.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic motion, rational approximation and an equivalent formulation of the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compact subset $K$ of the complex plane $\C$ is a set of polynomial (respectively rational) approximation if $P(K)=A(K)$ (respectively $R(K)=A(K)$), where $P(K)$ (respectively $R(K)$) is the family of functions on $K$ which are uniform limits of polynomials (respectively rational functions, having no poles on $K$) and $A(K)$ is the family of continuous functions on $K,$ which are holomorphic on the interior of $K.$ In the class of compact sets, the property of being a set of polynomial approximation is easily seen to be invariant under holomorphic motion. We show that this is no longer the case for rational approximation. Secondly, we show that the Riemann Hypothesis holds if and only if a certain map is a holomorphic motion.</description>

      <title>Difference "abc" theorem for entire functions and Difference analogue of truncated version of Nevanlinna second main theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the difference analogue of the Stothers-Mason theorem for entire functions of order less than 1, which can be seen as difference $abc$ theorem for entire functions. We also obtain the difference analogue of truncated version of Nevanlinna second main theorem which reveals that a subnormal meromorphic function $f(z)$ such that $\Delta f(z)\not\equiv 0$ cannot have too many points with long length in the complex plane. Both theorems depend on new definitions of the length of poles and zeros of a given meromorphic function in a domain. As for the application, we consider entire solutions of difference Fermat functional equations.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of a polynomial and its critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07105v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F(z)=\prod\limits_{k=1}^n(z-z_k)$ be a monic complex polynomial of degree $n$. In 1998, Pawlowski [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 350 (1998)] studied the radius $\gamma_n$ of the smallest concentric disk with center at $\tfrac{\sum\limits_{k=1}^nz_k}{n}$ contained at least one critical point of $F(z)$. He showed that $\gamma_n\le \tfrac{2n^\frac{1}{n-1}}{n^\frac{2}{n-1}+1}$. In this paper, we refine Pawlowski's result in the spirit of Borcea variance conjectures and classic Schoenberg inequality, specifically, we show that $\gamma_n\le\sqrt{\tfrac{n-2}{n-1}}$ in a very concise manner. Moreover, we obtain various generalizations of Schoenberg inequalities based on classic Schoenberg inequality including refining Lin-Xie-Zhang's result [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 502 (2021)], which is inspired by the author's recent work on Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities [arXiv:2410.21961] . Finally, we make $D$-companion matrix introduced by Cheung-Ng [Linear Algebra Appl. 432 (2010)] and operator inequalities involved Schatten $p$-norm react so that we provide an additional relationship between the zeros of $F(z)$ and its critical points in the case where all $z_k\ge 0$, which can be regarded as complements of Schmeisser's result [Comput. Methods Funct. Theory 3 (2003)]. By an operator 2-norm identity, we also prove Sendov conjecture with a condition that depends only on $\left( \tfrac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}\left|z_k-z_n\right|^2\right)^\frac{1}{2}$.</description>
