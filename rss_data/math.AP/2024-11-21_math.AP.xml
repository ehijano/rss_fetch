      <title>On the ill-posedness of kinetic wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12868v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we identify a sharp ill-posedness/well-posedness threshold for kinetic wave equations (KWE) derived from quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger models. We show well-posedness using a collisional averaging estimate proved in our earlier work \cite{AmLe}. Ill-posedness manifests as instantaneous loss of smoothness for well-chosen initial data. We also prove that both the gain-only and full equation share the same well-posedness threhold, thus legitimizing a gain-only approach to solving 4-wave kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of solutions to a generalized Fisher-KPP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following Fisher-KPP type equation $$ u_t=Ku_{xx}-Bu^q+Au^p, \quad (x,t)\in\real\times(0,\infty), $$ with $p&gt;q&gt;0$ and $A$, $B$, $K$ positive coefficients, is considered. For both $p&gt;q&gt;1$ and $p&gt;1$, $q=1$, we construct stationary solutions, establish their behavior as $|x|\to\infty$ and prove that they are separatrices between solutions decreasing to zero in infinite time and solutions presenting blow-up in finite time. We also establish decay rates for the solutions that decay to zero as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>A critical non-homogeneous heat equation with weighted source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some qualitative properties of radially symmetric solutions to the non-homogeneous heat equation with critical density and weighted source $$ |x|^{-2}\partial_tu=\Delta u+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,T), $$ are obtained, in the range of exponents $p&gt;1$, $\sigma\ge-2$. More precisely, we establish conditions fulfilled by the initial data in order for the solutions to either blow-up in finite time or decay to zero as $t\to\infty$ and, in the latter case, we also deduce decay rates and large time behavior. In the limiting case $\sigma=-2$ we prove the existence of non-trivial, non-negative solutions, in stark contrast to the homogeneous case. A transformation to a generalized Fisher-KPP equation is derived and employed in order to deduce these properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the advection equation along vector fields singular at the initial time. More precisely, we prove that for divergence-free vector fields in $L^1_{loc}((0, T ]; BV (\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))\cap L^2((0, T ) \times\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d)$, there exists a unique vanishing diffusivity solution. This class includes the vector field constructed by Depauw, for which there are infinitely many distinct bounded solutions to the advection equation.</description>

      <title>Existence of analytic non-convex V-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V-states are uniformly rotating vortex patches of the incompressible 2D Euler equation and the only known explicit examples are circles and ellipses. In this paper, we prove the existence of non-convex V-states with analytic boundary which are far from the known examples. To prove it, we use a combination of analysis of the linearized operator at an approximate solution and computer-assisted proof techniques.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear orbital stability of stationary shock profiles for the Lax-Wendroff scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the spectral, linear and nonlinear stability of stationary shock profile solutions to the Lax-Wendroff scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws. We first clarify the spectral stability of such solutions depending on the convexity of the flux for the underlying conservation law. The main contribution of this article is a detailed study of the so-called Green's function for the linearized numerical scheme. As evidenced on numerical simulations, the Green's function exhibits a highly oscillating behavior ahead of the leading wave before this wave reaches the shock location. One of our main results gives a quantitative description of this behavior. Because of the existence of a one-parameter family of stationary shock profiles, the linearized numerical scheme admits the eigenvalue 1 that is embedded in its continuous spectrum, which gives rise to several contributions in the Green's function. Our detailed analysis of the Green's function describes these contributions by means of a so-called activation function. For large times, the activation function describes how the mass of the initial condition accumulates along the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 1 of the linearized numerical scheme. We can then obtain sharp decay estimates for the linearized numerical scheme in polynomially weighted spaces, which in turn yield a nonlinear orbital stability result for spectrally stable stationary shock profiles. This nonlinear result is obtained despite the lack of uniform ${\ell}$ 1 estimates for the Green's function of the linearized numerical scheme, the lack of such estimates being linked with the dispersive nature of the numerical scheme. This dispersive feature is in sharp contrast with previous results on the orbital stability of traveling waves or discrete shock profiles for parabolic perturbations of conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on a network with Kirchhoff type conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on networks with Kirchhoff type conditions for the interior vertices and Dirichlet boundary conditions for the boundary ones: our aim is to provide general existence and comparison results in the case when the integro-differential operators are of order strictly less than 1. The main originality of these results is to allow these nonlocal terms to have contributions on several different edges of the network. The existence of Lipschitz continuous solutions is proved in two ways: either by using the vanishing viscosity method or by the usual Perron's method. The comparison proof relies on arguments introduced by Lions and Souganidis. We also introduce a notion of flux-limited solution, nonlocal analog to the one introduced by Imbert and Monneau, and prove that the solutions of the Kirchhoff problem are flux-limited solutions for a suitable flux-limiter. After treating in details the case when we only have one interior vertex, we extend our approach to treat general networks.</description>

      <title>High-order asymptotic expansion for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in the non-relativistic limit regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the high-order asymptotic expansion for 2D and 3D cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations in the non-relativistic limit regime. There are extensive numerical and analytic results concerning that the solution of NLKG can be approximated by first-order modulated Schr\"odinger profiles in terms of $e^{i\frac t {\varepsilon^2}}v + c.c. $, where $v$ is the solution of related NLS and ``$c.c.$" denotes the complex conjugate. Particularly, the best analytic result up to now is given in \cite{lei}, which proves that the $L_x^2$ norm of the error can be controlled by $\varepsilon^2 +(\varepsilon^2t)^{\frac \alpha 4}$ for $H^\alpha_x$-data, $\alpha \in [1, 4]$. As for the high-order expansion, to our best knowledge, there are only numerical results, while the theoretical one is lacking.
  In this paper, we extend this study further and give the first high-order analytic result. We introduce the high-order expansion inspired by the numerical experiments in \cite{schratz2020, faou2014a}: \[
  e^{i\frac t {\varepsilon^2}}v
  +\varepsilon^2
  \Big( \frac 18 e^{3i\frac t {\varepsilon^2} }v^3
  +e^{i\frac t {\varepsilon^2}} w
  \Big)
  +c.c.,
  \] where $w$ is the solution to some specific Schr\"odinger-type equation. We show that the $L_x^2$ estimate of the error is of higher order $\varepsilon^4+\left(\varepsilon^2t\right)^\frac{\alpha}{4}$ for $H^\alpha_x$-data, $\alpha \in [4, 8]$.</description>

      <title>Blurring the Busse balloon: Patterns in a stochastic Klausmeier model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate (in)stabilities of periodic patterns under stochastic forcing in reaction-diffusion equations exhibiting a so-called Busse balloon. Specifically, we used a one-dimensional Klausmeier model for dryland vegetation patterns. Using numerical methods, we can accurately describe the transient dynamics of the stochastic solutions and compare several notions of stability. In particular, we show that stochastic stability heavily depends on the model parameters, the intensity of the noise and the location of the wavenumber of the periodic pattern within the deterministic Busse balloon. Furthermore, the boundary of the Busse balloon becomes blurred under the stochastic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Stability results for Sobolev, logarithmic Sobolev, and related inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining explicit stability estimates in classical functional inequalities like the Sobolev inequality has been an essentially open question for 30 years, after the celebrated but non-constructive result of G. Bianchi and H. Egnell in 1991. Recently, new methods have emerged which provide some clues on these fascinating questions. The goal of the course is to give an introduction to the topic for some fundamental functional inequalities and present several methods that can be used to obtain explicit estimates.</description>

      <title>A Birkhoff Normal Form Theorem for Partial Differential Equations on torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an abstract Birkhoff normal form theorem for Hamiltonian partial differential equations on torus. The normal form is complete up to arbitrary finite order. The proof is based on a valid non-resonant condition and a suitable norm of Hamiltonian function. Then as two examples, we apply this theorem to nonlinear wave equation in one dimension and nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in high dimension. Consequently, the polynomially long time stability is proved in Sobolev spaces $H^s$ with the index $s$ being much smaller than before. Further, by taking the iterative steps depending on the size of initial datum, we prove sub-exponentially long time stability for these two equations.</description>

      <title>Conservation Laws with Discontinuous Gradient-Dependent Flux: the Unstable Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with a scalar conservation law with discontinuous gradient-dependent flux. Namely, the flux is described by two different functions $f(u)$ or $g(u)$, when the gradient $u_x$ of the solution is positive or negative, respectively. We study here the unstable case where $f(u)&gt;g(u)$ for all $u\in {\mathbb R}$. Assuming that both $f$ and $g$ are strictly convex, solutions to the Riemann problem are constructed. Even for smooth initial data, examples show that infinitely many solutions can occur.
  For an initial data which is piecewise monotone, i.e., increasing or decreasing on a finite number of intervals, a global solution of the Cauchy problem is obtained. It is proved that such solution is unique under the additional requirement that the number of interfaces, where the flux switches between $f$ and $g$, remains as small as possible.</description>

      <title>Linearization of quasistatic fracture evolution in brittle materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a linearization result for quasistatic fracture evolution in nonlinear elasticity. As the stiffness of the material tends to infinity, we show that rescaled displacement fields and their associated crack sets converge to a solution of quasistatic crack growth in linear elasticity without any a priori assumptions on the geometry of the crack set. This result corresponds to the evolutionary counterpart of the static linearization result by the first author, where a Griffith model for nonsimple brittle materials has been considered featuring an elastic energy which also depends suitably on the second gradient of the deformations. The proof relies on a careful study of unilateral global minimality, as determined by the nonlinear evolutionary problem, and its linearization together with a variant of the jump transfer lemma in GSBD.</description>

      <title>Existence of All Wilton Ripples of the Kawahara Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of all small-amplitude Wilton ripple solutions of the Kawahara equation is proven. These are periodic, traveling-wave solutions that bifurcate from a two-dimensional nullspace spanned by two distinct, co-propagating cosine waves. In contrast with previous results, the proof, which relies on a carefully constructed Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, implies the existence of all small-amplitude Wilton ripples of the Kawahara equation, of which there are countably infinite. Though this result pertains only to the Kawahara equation, the method of proof likely extends to most nonlinear dispersive equations admitting Wilton ripple solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-persistence of strongly isolated singularities, and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a generic regularity result for stationary integral $n$-varifolds assumed to have only strongly isolated singularities inside $N$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, without any restriction on the dimension ($n\geq 2$) and codimension. As a special case, we prove that for any $n\geq 2$ and any compact $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold $M$ the following holds: for a generic choice of the background metric $g$ all stationary integral $n$-varifolds in $(M,g)$ will either be entirely smooth or have at least one singular point that is not strongly isolated. In other words, for a generic metric only "more complicated" singularities may possibly persist. This implies, for instance, a generic finiteness result for the class of all closed minimal hypersurfaces of area at most $4\pi^2-\varepsilon$ (for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$) in nearly round four-spheres: we can thus give precise answers, in the negative, to the questions of persistence of the Clifford football and of Hsiang's hyperspheres in nearly-round metrics. The aforementioned main regularity result is achieved as a consequence of the fine analysis of the Fredholm index of the Jacobi operator for such varifolds: we prove on the one hand an exact formula relating that number to the Morse indices of the conical links at the singular points, while on the other hand we show that such an index is non-negative for all such varifolds if the ambient metric is generic.</description>

      <title>Preserving curvature lower bounds when Ricci flowing non-smooth initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13204v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we survey some results on Ricci flowing non-smooth initial data. Among other things, we give a non-exhaustive list of various weak initial data which can be evolved with the Ricci flow. We also survey results which show that various curvature lower bounds will, possibly up to a constant, be preserved, if we start with such possibly non-smooth initial data. Some proofs/proof sketches are given in certain cases. A list of some open problems related to these areas is given in the last section of the paper.</description>

      <title>CB$^2$O: Consensus-Based Bi-Level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bi-level optimization problems, where one wishes to find the global minimizer of an upper-level objective function over the globally optimal solution set of a lower-level objective, arise in a variety of scenarios throughout science and engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose and investigate, analytically and experimentally, consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), a multi-particle metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method designed to solve bi-level optimization problems when both objectives may be nonconvex. Our method leverages within the computation of the consensus point a carefully designed particle selection principle implemented through a suitable choice of a quantile on the level of the lower-level objective, together with a Laplace principle-type approximation w.r.t. the upper-level objective function, to ensure that the bi-level optimization problem is solved in an intrinsic manner. We give an existence proof of solutions to a corresponding mean-field dynamics, for which we first establish the stability of our consensus point w.r.t. a combination of Wasserstein and $L^2$ perturbations, and consecutively resort to PDE considerations extending the classical Picard iteration to construct a solution. For such solution, we provide a global convergence analysis in mean-field law showing that the solution of the associated nonlinear nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation converges exponentially fast to the unique solution of the bi-level optimization problem provided suitable choices of the hyperparameters. The practicability and efficiency of our CB$^2$O algorithm is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in the settings of constrained global optimization, sparse representation learning, and robust (clustered) federated learning.</description>

      <title>Estimates controlling a function by only its radial derivative and applications to stable solutions of elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish two new estimates which control a function (after subtracting its average) in $L^1$ by only the $L^1$ norm of its radial derivative. While the interior estimate holds for all superharmonic functions, the boundary version is much more delicate. It requires the function to be a stable solution of a semilinear elliptic equation with a nonnegative, nondecreasing, and convex nonlinearity. As an application, our estimates provide quantitative proofs of two results established by contradiction-compactness proofs in [Cabre, Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra, Acta Math. 224 (2020)]. We recall that this work proved the H\"older regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations in the optimal range of dimensions $n \leq 9$.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of composition operators on Sobolev spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the basic concepts of the geometric theory of composition operators on Sobolev spaces. The main objects of the theory are topological mappings which generate bounded embedding operators on Sobolev spaces by the composition rule. This theory is in some sense a "generalization" of the theory of quasiconformal mappings, but the theory of composition operators is oriented to its applications to the Sobolev embedding theorems, the spectral theory of elliptic operators and continuum mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Varopoulos extensions in domains with Ahlfors-regular boundaries and applications to Boundary Value Problems for elliptic systems with $L^\infty$ coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10717v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n\geq 1$, be an open set with $s$-Ahlfors regular boundary $\partial \Omega$, for some $s \in(0,n]$, such that either $s=n$ and $\Omega$ is a corkscrew domain with the pointwise John condition, or $s&lt;n$ and $\Omega= \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus E$, for some $s$-Ahlfors regular set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In this paper we provide a unifying method to construct Varopoulos' type extensions of $BMO$ and $L^p$ boundary functions. In particular, we show that a) if $ f \in BMO(\partial \Omega)$, there exists $ F\in C^\infty(\Omega)$ such that $dist(x, \Omega^c)|\nabla F(x)|$ is uniformly bounded in $\Omega$ and the Carleson functional of $dist(x,\Omega^c)^{s-n}|\nabla F(x)|$ as well the sharp non-tangential maximal function of $ F$ are uniformly bounded on $\partial \Omega$ with norms controlled by the $BMO$-norm of $ f$, and $ F \to f$ in a certain non-tangential sense $\mathcal H^s|_{\partial \Omega}$-almost everywhere; b) if $\bar f \in L^p(\partial \Omega)$, $1 &lt;p \leq \infty$, there exists $\bar F \in C^\infty(\Omega)$ such that the non-tangential maximal functions of $\bar F$ and $dist(\cdot, \Omega^c)|\nabla \bar F|$ as well as the Carleson functional of $dist(\cdot,\Omega^c)^{s-n}|\nabla \bar F|$ are in $L^p(\partial \Omega)$ with norms controlled by the $L^p$-norm of $\bar f$, and $\bar F \to \bar f$ in some non-tangential sense $\mathcal H^s|_{\partial \Omega}$-almost everywhere. If, in addition, the boundary function is Lipschitz with compact support, then both $F$ and $\bar F$ can be constructed so that they are also Lipschitz on $\bar\Omega$ and converge to the boundary data continuously. The latter results hold without the additional assumption of the pointwise John condition. Finally, we give some applications of the constructed extensions in the connection between Poisson problems and BVPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00614v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half space. It is known that if the matrix $A$ is independent in the transversal $t$-direction, then we have $\omega\in A_\infty(\sigma)$. In the present paper we improve on the $t$-independece condition by introducing a mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ Carleson type condition that only depends on $\partial_t A$ and show $\omega\in A_\infty(\sigma)$ under this condition. This mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ Carleson type condition applies to elliptic operators not covered by the DKP condition, the $t$-independence condition or the Dini condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study vector-valued functions that minimise the $L^\infty$-norm of their derivatives for prescribed boundary data. We construct a vector-valued, mass minimising $1$-current (i.e., a generalised geodesic) in the domain such that all solutions of the problem coincide on its support. Furthermore, this current can be interpreted as a streamline of the solutions. The construction relies on a $p$-harmonic approximation. In the case of scalar-valued functions, it is closely related to a construction of Evans and Yu. We therefore obtain an extension of their theory.</description>

      <title>Approximation of divergence-free vector fields vanishing on rough planar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any divergence-free vector field of Sobolev class $W^{m,p}_0(\Omega)$ in a bounded open subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, we are interested in approximating it in the $W^{m,p}$ norm with divergence-free smooth vector fields compactly supported in $\Omega$. We show that this approximation property holds in the following cases: For $p&gt;2$, this holds given that $\partial \Omega$ has zero Lebesgue measure (a weaker but more technical condition is sufficient); For $p \leq 2$, this holds if $\Omega^c$ can be decomposed into finitely many disjoint closed sets, each of which is connected or $d$-Ahlfors regular for some $d\in[0,2)$. This has links to the uniqueness of weak solutions to the Stokes equation in $\Omega$. For H\"older spaces, we prove this approximation property in general bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Sobolev estimates for the Keller-Segel system and applications to the JKO scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove $L^{\infty}_{t}W^{1,p}_{x}$ Sobolev estimates in the Keller-Segel system by proving a functional inequality, inspired by the Brezis-Gallou\"et-Wainger inequality. These estimates are also valid at the discrete level in the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme. By coupling this result with the diffusion properties of a functional according to Bakry-Emery theory, we deduce the $L^2_t H^{2}_{x}$ convergence of the scheme, thereby extending the recent result of Santambrogio and Toshpulatov in the context of the Fokker-Planck equation to the Keller-Segel system.</description>

      <title>Condensation effects in kinetic models for consensus dynamics: finite-time blow-up and regularity aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the main properties of the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation characterized by a variable diffusion coefficient and a polynomial superlinear drift, modeling the formation of consensus in a large interacting system of individuals. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the kinetic description of the dynamics of a quantum particle system, and in presence of a high nonlinearity in the drift operator, mimicking the effects of the mass in the alignment forces, allows for steady states similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The analysis shows that the regularity of the solution is strongly linked to the degree of nonlinearity in the drift, and that finite-time blow-up of the solution can occur when the degree of nonlinearity is sufficiently high. However, the presence of diffusion prevents the solution from forming condensation after the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>On the Isoperimetric Riemannian Penrose Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10215v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Riemannian Penrose Inequality holds for Asymptotically Flat $3$-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and connected horizon boundary, provided the optimal decay assumptions are met, which result in the $\mathrm{ADM}$ mass being a well-defined geometric invariant. Our proof builds on a novel interplay between the Hawking mass and a potential-theoretic version of it, recently introduced by Agostiniani, Oronzio and the third named author. As a consequence, we establish the equality between $\mathrm{ADM}$ mass and Huisken's Isoperimetric mass under the above sharp assumptions. Moreover, we establish a Riemannian Penrose Inequality in terms of the Isoperimetric mass on any $3$-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature, connected horizon boundary, and which supports a well-posed notion of weak Inverse Mean Curvature Flow. In particular, such Isoperimetric Riemannian Penrose Inequality does not require the asymptotic flatness of the manifold. The argument is based on a new asymptotic comparison result involving Huisken's Isoperimetric mass and the Hawking mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for embedding anisotropic variable exponent Sobolev spaces into spaces of anisotropic variable exponent H\"{o}lder-continuous functions within rectangular domains. We establish a foundational approach to extend the concept of H\"{o}lder continuity to anisotropic settings with variable exponents, providing deeper insight into the regularity of functions across different directions. Our results not only broaden the understanding of anisotropic function spaces but also open new avenues for applications in mathematical and applied sciences.</description>
