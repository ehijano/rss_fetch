      <title>Faith Believes, Hope Expects: The Impact of Calvin's Theology on the Mathematics of Chance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper attributes the sudden emergence of mathematical probability and statistics in the second half of the seventeenth century to Calvin's Reformed theology. Calvin accommodated Epicurean chance with Stoic determinism and synthesised \emph{phronesis/prudentia}, founded personal experience and employed to deal with \emph{tyche/fortuna}, and \emph{episteme/scientia}, universal knowledge. This meant that matters of chance, which had previously been considered too particular for mathematical treatment, became part of \emph{episteme/scientia}. Clear evidence of the significance of Calvin in mathematics is in the facts that Huygens considered using the word 'hope' to describe mathematical expectation and French mathematics still uses \emph{esp\'erance} for mathematical expectation. Calvin asserted that Hope represented a universal, objective and indubitable idea making it characteristic of mathematics. The argument is built on a review of how the ideas of Hope, Faith and Prudence have evolved in European thought that highlights Calvin's innovations. The conclusion identifies contemporary issues in the application of mathematics in society that are illuminated in light of Calvin's doctrine.</description>

      <title>Solution Numbers for Eight Blocks to Madness Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 30 MacMahon colored cubes have each face painted with one of six colors and every color appears on at least one face. One puzzle involving these cubes is to create a $2\times2\times2$ model with eight distinct MacMahon cubes to recreate a larger version with the external coloring of a specified target cube, also a MacMahon cube, and touching interior faces are the same color. J.H. Conway is credited with arranging the cubes in a $6\times6$ tableau that gives a solution to this puzzle. In fact, the particular set of eight cubes that solves this puzzle can be arranged in exactly \textit{two} distinct ways to solve the puzzle. We study a less restrictive puzzle without requiring interior face matching. We describe solutions to the $2\times2\times2$ puzzle and the number of distinct solutions attainable for a collection of eight cubes. Additionally, given a collection of eight MacMahon cubes, we study the number of target cubes that can be built in a $2\times2\times2$ model. We calculate the distribution of the number of cubes that can be built over all collections of eight cubes (the maximum number is five) and provide a complete characterization of the collections that can build five distinct cubes. Furthermore, we identify nine new sets of twelve cubes, called Minimum Universal sets, from which all 30 cubes can be built.</description>
