      <title>The performance of microwave photonic signal processors based on microcombs with different input signal waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave photonic (MWP) signal processors, which process microwave signals based on pho-tonic technologies, bring advantages intrinsic to photonics such as low loss, large processing bandwidth, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. Optical microcombs can offer a large number of wavelength channels and compact device footprints, which make them powerful multi-wavelength sources for MWP signal processors to realize a variety of processing functions. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the capability of microcomb-based MWP signal processors to handle diverse input signal waveforms. In addition, we quantify the processing accuracy for different input signal waveforms, including Gaussian, triangle, parabolic, super Gaussian, and nearly square waveforms. Finally, we analyze the factors contributing to the dif-ference in the processing accuracy among the different input waveforms, and our theoretical analysis well elucidates the experimental results. These results provide a guidance for micro-comb-based MWP signal processors when processing microwave signals of various waveforms.</description>

      <title>Statistic Vectorial Complex Ray Model and its Application to Three-Dimension Scattering of a Non-spherical Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Statistic Vectorial Complex Ray Model (SVCRM) is proposed for the scattering of a plane wave by a non-spherical dielectric particle in three dimensions. This method counts the complex amplitudes of all rays arriving in a tiny box in the observation direction. It avoids the two-dimensional interpolation necessary in the Vectorial Complex Ray Model (VCRM) for the calculation of the total field. So, it is more flexible and suitable to deal with the particle of complex shape. The algorithm has been carefully designed for the calculation of the phases due to the optical path, the reflection and the focal lines/points as well as the amplitude variation caused by the reflection, the refraction and the divergence of the wave on the particle surface. This model is then applied, as an example, to simulate the three-dimensional scattering patterns of a pendent drop. The scattering mechanism is analyzed in details and the special attention has been paid to the scattering patterns around the rainbow angles where the caustics occur. The simulated results have been compared to the experimental results for a pendent drop of two typical sizes and shapes. It is shown that the simulated and the experimental results are in good agreement. This method opens a promising potential in the development of optical measurement techniques in fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Micro-Raman spectroscopy of graphene defects and tracing the oxidation process caused by UV exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is one of the widely used methods in the analysis of various samples including carbon-based materials. This study aimed to identify the number of layers and defects in graphene using micro-Raman spectroscopy. More specifically, the study examined tracing the oxidation process of graphene under UV exposure. Investigation of the effect of the power density of the Raman excitation laser reveals a linear dependence between the ratio of I2D/IG and the power density of the excitation laser. Also, the absence of peak D due to the increase in power density provides evidence for the non-destructive nature of micro-Raman spectroscopy. Given the value of I2D/IG, one of the parameters for determining the number of layers in graphene which has reached 1.39 at the edge, the findings indicate the possibility of an edge fold of single-layer graphene. During the oxidation process, the intensity and position of the D peak increase as a function of exposure time. Alterations in the graphene Raman spectrum, comprising the disappearance of the 2D peak and the appearance of the D peak, trace and confirm the oxidation process of the sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a nonlinear autoregressive neural network with a hidden layer of 50 neurons, three delays and one output layer that accurately is capable of predict the appearence of extreme events in a Kerr lens mode locking Ti:Sapphire laser with ultrashort pulses. Extreme events are produced in the context of a chaotic atractor and with chirped pulses. The prediction of this neural network works well with experimental and theoretical time series of amplitude of laser pulses. When fed with experimental time series we have 95.45\% of hits and 6.67\% of false positives while using theoretical time series the network predicts 100\% of extreme events but the false positive rise to 23.33\%.</description>

      <title>Single-frame transmission and phase imaging using off-axis holography with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging with undetected photons relies upon nonlinear interferometry to extract the spatial image from an infrared probe beam and reveal it in the interference pattern of an easier-to-detect visible beam. Typically, the transmission and phase images are extracted using phase-shifting techniques and combining interferograms from multiple frames. Here we show that off-axis digital holography enables reconstruction of both transmission and phase images at the infrared wavelength from a single interferogram, and hence a single frame, recorded in the visible. This eliminates the need for phase stepping and multiple acquisitions, thereby greatly reducing total measurement time for imaging with long acquisition times at low flux or enabling video-rate imaging at higher flux. With this single-frame acquisition technique, we are able to reconstruct transmission images of an object in the infrared beam with a signal-to-noise ratio of $1.78\,\pm\,0.06$ at 10 frames per second, and record a dynamic scene in the infrared beam at 33 frames per second.</description>

      <title>Characterization of pixel crosstalk and impact of Bayer patterning by quantum efficiency measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of small pixels for high resolution image sensors implies a lot of challenges. A high level of performance should be guaranteed whereas the overall size must be reduced and so the degree of freedom in design and process. One key parameter of this constant improvement is the knowledge and the control of the crosstalk between pixels. In this paper, we present an advance in crosstalk characterization method based on the design of specific color patterns and the measurement of quantum efficiency. In a first part, we describe the color patterns designed to isolate one pixel or to simulate un-patterned colored pixels. These patterns have been implemented on test-chip and characterized. The second part deals with the characterization setup for quantum efficiency. Indeed, the use of spectral measurements allows us to discriminate pixels based on the color filter placed on top of them and to probe the crosstalk as a function of the depth in silicon, thanks to the photon absorption length variation with the wavelength. In the last part, results are presented showing the impact of color filters patterning, i.e. pixels in a Bayer pattern versus un-patterned pixels. The crosstalk directions and amplitudes are also analyzed in relation to pixel layout.</description>

Abstract: We report on a comprehensive experimental investigation into the spatial-spectral complexity of the laser beam during Kerr-induced beam self-cleaning in graded-index multimode fibers. We demonstrate the self-cleaning of beams using both transform-limited and chirped femtosecond pulses. By utilizing the spectrally resolved imaging technique, we examine variations in beam homogeneity during the beam cleanup process and reveal correlations observed among spatial beam profiles at different wavelengths for the various cleaned pulses. Our results significantly advance our understanding of Kerr-induced self-cleaning with chirped ultrafast pulses and offer new possibilities for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon super-linear image scanning microscopy using upconversion nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is of great interest in life science studies for visualizing subcellular structures at the nanometer scale. Among various kinds of super-resolution approaches, image scanning microscopy (ISM) offers a doubled resolution enhancement in a simple and straightforward manner, based on the commonly used confocal microscopes. ISM is also suitable to be integrated with multi-photon microscopy techniques, such as two-photon excitation and second-harmonic generation imaging, for deep tissue imaging, but it remains the twofold limited resolution enhancement and requires expensive femtosecond lasers. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate the super-linear ISM (SL-ISM) to push the resolution enhancement beyond the factor of two, with a single low-power, continuous-wave, and near-infrared laser, by harnessing the emission nonlinearity within the multiphoton excitation process of lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). Based on a modified confocal microscope, we achieve a resolution of about 120 nm, 1/8th of the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, we demonstrate a parallel detection strategy of SL-ISM with the multifocal structured excitation pattern, to speed up the acquisition frame rate. This method suggests a new perspective for super-resolution imaging or sensing, multi-photon imaging, and deep-tissue imaging with simple, low-cost, and straightforward implementations.</description>

Abstract: In a recent article Babiker et al. [Optics Communications $\mathbf{554}$, 130185 (2024)] claim that cylindrical vector beams (CVBs), also referred to as higher-order Poincar\'e (HOP) beams, possess optical chirality densities which exhibit `superchirality'. Here we show that, on the contrary, CVBs possess less optical chirality density than a corresponding circularly polarized scalar vortex beam and that the `superchiral' results are nonphysical. We also identify a number of issues concerning the derivation and general theory presented.</description>

      <title>Hybrid deep learning and physics-based neural network for programmable illumination computational microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relying on either deep models or physical models are two mainstream approaches for solving inverse sample reconstruction problems in programmable illumination computational microscopy. Solutions based on physical models possess strong generalization capabilities while struggling with global optimization of inverse problems due to a lack of insufficient physical constraints. In contrast, deep learning methods have strong problem-solving abilities, but their generalization ability is often questioned because of the unclear physical principles. Besides, conventional deep models are difficult to apply to some specific scenes because of the difficulty in acquiring high-quality training data and their limited capacity to generalize across different scenarios. In this paper, to combine the advantages of deep models and physical models together, we propose a hybrid framework consisting of three sub-neural networks (two deep learning networks and one physics-based network). We first obtain a result with rich semantic information through a light deep learning neural network and then use it as the initial value of the physical network to make its output comply with physical process constraints. These two results are then used as the input of a fusion deep learning neural work which utilizes the paired features between the reconstruction results of two different models to further enhance imaging quality. The final result integrates the advantages of both deep models and physical models and can quickly solve the computational reconstruction inverse problem in programmable illumination computational microscopy and achieve better results. We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework with theoretical analysis and actual experiments on resolution targets and biological samples.</description>

      <title>Intensity product-based optical sensing to beat the diffraction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classically defined optical phase sensitivity is known as the shot-noise limit (SNL) or standard quantum limit originating in the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Based on SNL, the phase resolution (sensitivity) is inversely proportional to the square root N, where N is the number of interfering photons or individually measured events. Thus, using a high-power laser is advantageous due to the square root N gain in the signal-to-noise ratio. In an optical interferometer, however, the phase resolution remains in the N=1 case unless N probe photons are resolved in a detection process, resulting in the diffraction limit of classical optics. Here, a projective measurement is proposed for intensity product-based optical sensing to realize SNL in a typical interferometer commonly used for high-precision metrology. For this, one of the output ports of the interferometer is evenly divided into N ports and measured them for mth-intensity correlations (m is less than or equal to N), where the maximum N is given by the total number of photons of the input laser. The maximum temporal delay among N photons is constrained by the spectral bandwidth of the laser, which is the same as the effective coherence time of the photon ensemble used for coincidence detection-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved measurement of acoustic density fluctuations using a phase-shifting Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-shifting interferometry is one of the optical measurement techniques that improves accuracy and resolution by incorporating a controlled phase shift into conventional optical interferometry. In this study, a four-step phase-shifting interferometer is developed to measure the spatio-temporal distribution of acoustic density oscillations of the gas next to a rigid plate. The experimental apparatus consists of a polarizing Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a polarization camera capable of capturing four polarization directions in one shot image and it is used to measure the magnitude and the phase of density fluctuations through a duct of rectangular cross-section connected to a loudspeaker. The results are compared with the well-established thermoacoustic theory describing the thermal coupling between acoustic oscillations and rigid boundaries, and the results show a very good agreement for various ratios of the (frequency-dependent) thermal boundary layer thickness to the plate spacing. This measurement technique could be advantageously employed to analyze more complex heat transfer processes involving the coupling of acoustic oscillations with rigid boundaries.</description>

      <title>Self-injection-locked optical parametric oscillator based on microcombs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrow-linewidth yet tunable laser oscillators are one of the most important tools for precision metrology, optical atomic clocks, sensing and quantum computing. Commonly used tunable coherent oscillators are based on stimulated emission or stimulated Brillouin scattering; as a result, the operating wavelength band is limited by the gain media. Based on nonlinear optical gain, optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) enable coherent signal generation within the whole transparency window of the medium used. However, the demonstration of OPO-based Hertz-level linewidth and tunable oscillators has remained elusive. Here, we present a tunable coherent oscillator based on a multimode coherent OPO in a high-Q microresonator, i.e., a microcomb. Single-mode coherent oscillation is realized through self-injection locking (SIL) of one selected comb line. We achieve coarse tuning up to 20 nm, and an intrinsic linewidth down to sub-Hertz level, which is three orders of magnitude lower than the pump. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this scheme results into repetition rate stabilization of the microcomb. These results open exciting possibilities for generating tunable coherent radiation where stimulated emission materials are difficult to obtain, and the stabilization of microcomb sources beyond the limits imposed by the thermorefractive noise in the cavity.</description>

Abstract: Terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) has emerged as a potent technique for probing ultrafast nanoscale dynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal precision, whereby the acquisition of THz near-field waveforms holds paramount significance. While substantial efforts have been dedicated to retrieving the waveform utilizing the photoemission current or a molecular sensor, these methods are challenged by intensive thermal effects or complex sample preparations. In this study, we introduce a universal approach for real-time characterization of THz near-field waveforms within the tunnel junction, achieving sub-nanometer spatial resolution. Utilizing the gating mechanism intrinsic to the STM junction, coherent scanning of a gated strong THz pulse over a weak THz pulse is achieved, facilitating direct measurement of the waveform. Notably, employing a custom-built Carrier-Envelope Phase (CEP) shifter, THz-CEP has been successfully characterized in the tunnel junction. Moreover, sub-nanometer spatial resolution of the THz-driven field emission current has been shown, underscoring the nanoscale resolving ability of our methodology. Ultimately, the potential application of this method for local THz time domain spectroscopy imaging has been demonstrated through point-to-point waveform sampling over the Au (111) surface.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Polarization in WSe$_2$ Quantum Emitters through Deterministic Strain Engineering</title>

Abstract: Quantum emitters in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for generating single photons for optical quantum information processing. In this work, we present an approach for deterministically controlling the polarization of fabricated quantum emitters in a tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer. We employ novel nanopillar geometries with long and sharp tips to induce a controlled directional strain in the monolayer, and we report on fabricated WSe$_2$ emitters producing single photons with a high degree of polarization $(99\pm 4 \%)$ and high purity ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.030 \pm 0.025$). Our work paves the way for the deterministic integration of TMD-based quantum emitters for future photonic quantum technologies.</description>
