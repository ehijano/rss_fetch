      <title>Multifractality and its sources in the digital currency market</title>

Abstract: Multifractality in time series analysis characterizes the presence of multiple scaling exponents, indicating heterogeneous temporal structures and complex dynamical behaviors beyond simple monofractal models. In the context of digital currency markets, multifractal properties arise due to the interplay of long-range temporal correlations and heavy-tailed distributions of returns, reflecting intricate market microstructure and trader interactions. Incorporating multifractal analysis into the modeling of cryptocurrency price dynamics enhances the understanding of market inefficiencies, may improve volatility forecasting and facilitate the detection of critical transitions or regime shifts. Based on the multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MFCCA) whose spacial case is the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), as the most commonly used practical tools for quantifying multifractality, in the present contribution a recently proposed method of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series was applied to the most representative instruments from the digital market. They include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), decentralized exchanges (DEX) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The results indicate the significant role of heavy tails in generating a broad multifractal spectrum. However, they also clearly demonstrate that the primary source of multifractality are temporal correlations in the series, and without them, multifractality fades out. It appears characteristic that these temporal correlations, to a large extent, do not depend on the thickness of the tails of the fluctuation distribution. These observations, made here in the context of the digital currency market, provide a further strong argument for the validity of the proposed methodology of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Models studies for laser-plasma accelerator electron source design through numerical optimisation</title>

Abstract: Designing a high-quality plasma injector electron source driven by a laser beam relies on numerical parametric studies using particle-in-cell codes. The common input parameters to explore are laser characteristics, plasma species and density profiles produced by computational fluid dynamic studies. We demonstrate the construction of surrogate models using machine learning techniques for a laser-plasma injector (LPI) based on more than $3000$ particle-in-cell simulations of laser wakefield acceleration performed for sparsely spaced input parameters published by Drobniak [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams, 26, 091302, (2023)]. Surrogate models are relevant for LPI design and optimisation, as they are approximately $10^7$ times faster than PIC simulations. Their speed enables more efficient design studies by allowing extensive exploration of the input-output relationship without significant computational cost. We develop and compare the performance of three surrogate models, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision trees (DT) and Gaussian processes (GP). We show that using a simple and frugal MLP-based model trained on a reasonable-size random scan data set of 500 particles in cell simulations, we can predict beam parameters with a coefficient determination score $R^2=0.93$ . The best surrogate model is used to quickly find optimal working points and stability regions and get targeted electron beam energy, charge, energy spread and emittance using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation. This simple approach can serve more global design study of an LPI in a start-to-end linear laser-driven accelerator.on beam energy, charge and energy spread using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation</description>
