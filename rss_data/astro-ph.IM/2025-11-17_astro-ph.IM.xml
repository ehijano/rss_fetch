      <title>Practical Author Name Disambiguation under Metadata Constraints: A Contrastive Learning Approach for Astronomy Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to distinctly and properly collate an individual researcher's publications is crucial for ensuring appropriate recognition, guiding the allocation of research funding and informing hiring decisions. However, accurately grouping and linking a researcher's entire body of work with their individual identity is challenging because of widespread name ambiguity across the growing literature. Algorithmic author name disambiguation provides a scalable approach to disambiguating author identities, yet existing methods have limitations. Many modern author name disambiguation methods rely on comprehensive metadata features such as venue or affiliation. Despite advancements in digitally indexing publications, metadata is often unavailable or inconsistent in large digital libraries(e.g. NASA/ADS). We introduce the Neural Author Name Disambiguator, a method that disambiguates author identities in large digital libraries despite limited metadata availability. We formulate the disambiguation task as a similarity learning problem by employing a Siamese neural network to disambiguate author names across publications relying solely on widely available publication metadata-author names, titles and abstracts. We construct the Large-Scale Physics ORCiD Linked dataset to evaluate the Neural Author Name Disambiguator by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications ORCiD. By leveraging foundation models to embed metadata into features, our model achieves up to 94% accuracy in pairwise disambiguation and over 95% F1 in clustering publications into their researcher identities. We release the testing dataset as a benchmark for physics and astronomy, providing realistic evaluation conditions for future disambiguation methods. The Neural Author Name Disambiguator algorithm demonstrates effective disambiguation with minimal metadata, offering a scalable solution for name ambiguity in large digital libraries.</description>

      <title>Optimization of lenslet arrays for PRIMA Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a cryogenically cooled 1.8-m space telescope designed to address fundamental questions about the evolution of galactic ecosystems, the origins of planetary atmospheres, and the buildup of dust and metals over cosmic time. PRIMA will achieve unprecedented sensitivity in the 24 - 261 $\mu$m wavelength range, enabled by background-limited kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) cooled to 120 mK. For PRIMA's Far-InfraRed Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) instrument, we have developed monolithic kilopixel silicon lenslet arrays to efficiently couple incident radiation from the telescope's fore-optics onto the KID absorber elements. These three-dimensional lenslet arrays are fabricated using grayscale lithography, followed by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), and are anti-reflection (AR) coated with a quarter-wavelength thick deposition of Parylene-C. The lenslet arrays are aligned and bonded to the KID arrays using a thin layer of epoxy through a flip-chip bonder. In this work, we report on the optimized fabrication, lens design, AR coating, and bonding processes developed for the FIRESS lenslet arrays. We characterize brassboard lenslet arrays fabricated to meet the specifications of the FIRESS low and high spectral bands, demonstrate stepped-thickness AR-coatings to achieve high efficiency across broad wavelength ranges, and present spectral transmission measurements of the AR coating and the epoxy bonding layers.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys -- the Mock Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space mission, designed to carry out a large-area sky survey to explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the Universe. The onboard multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic modules will enable us to obtain photometric data for billions of galaxies and stars, as well as hundreds of millions of spectroscopic measurements, advancing various scientific analyses such as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing. To support the image simulations for the main survey of the CSST mission, we present a mock catalogue of stars and galaxies. For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z~3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement. The catalogue provides a flexible dataset for the development of CSST image processing and can support a wide range of cosmological analyses within the CSST mission.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Map of the Universe: A pilot survey to detect high Galactic latitude pulsars in variance images with ASKAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that radio pulsars can be distinguished from other point-like radio sources in continuum images by their unique interstellar scintillation signatures. Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a ~480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3. This source shows a steep radio spectrum and a high degree of circular polarisation. These results underscore the strong potential of variance imaging for pulsar detection in full EMU and future radio continuum surveys planned with Square Kilometre Array (SKA).</description>

      <title>PRIMA General Observer Science Book Volume 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) mission concept is a proposed mission to NASA's Astrophysics Probe Explorer (APEX) call. The concept features a cryogenically cooled 1.8 m diameter telescope, and is designed to carry two science instruments covering the 24 to 264 $\mu$m wavelength range: an imaging polarimeter (PRIMAger) and a spectrometer (FIRESS). The majority of PRIMA's time (75%) will be open to observations proposed by the community (General Observer science / GO), and all of data will be publicly available for archival research (Guest Investigator science / GI). Following up on the successful community engagement created by the first volume of the GO PRIMA Science Book (arXiv:2310.20572), Volume 2 gathers 120 new and updated contributed science cases which could be performed within the context of the PRIMA GO/GI program. This volume reflects the strong development of the community interest, awareness and involvement in PRIMA, and further develops how PRIMA's unprecedented capabilities can be leveraged for an impactful and innovative GO/GI program covering most areas of astrophysics and over 90% of the scientific questions and discovery areas in the Astro2020 decadal survey.</description>

      <title>Surface figure metrology for reflective membrane mirrors based on phase-measuring deflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflective membrane mirrors provide a lightweight, low-cost alternative to traditional optics for next-generation large-aperture telescopes, but their non-rigid, thin structure poses challenges for surface metrology. We present a phase-measuring deflectometry (PMD) system enhanced with tailored ray-tracing and iterative reconstruction to enable non-contact measurement of large membrane optics. The system successfully characterizes the surface figure and evaluates the dynamic stability of a 1-meter Hencky-type membrane mirror. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PMD as a practical metrology tool for future membrane-based telescope systems.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Platform for Small Solar System Bodies using the Einstein-Elevator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small solar system bodies are becoming increasingly important as missions like NASA's OSIRIS-REx show. However, the study of the characteristics and behavior of these objects on Earth is a challenge as the simulation of their environmental conditions is difficult. We present in this paper an approach to enable the simulation of SSSB conditions in a drop tower facility on Earth, which is being addressed as part of the AKUS ("Activity of Comets under Partial Gravity") project. This especially concerns their prevailing gravity levels, which range between 10^-2 g and 10^-4 g. In order to simulate the conditions of SSSB as accurately as possible, an acceleration system based on servo motors and spindle axes has been developed. The accelerations are transferred from the motors to the spindle axes containing a comet-like sample. These are together placed inside a vacuum chamber providing a vacuum quality of 10^-6 mbar. The whole setup is installed inside the Einstein-Elevator. Our results show that, with the current setup, we are able to generate conditions from 10^-2 g down to 10^-3 g. The maximum deviations under these conditions are +/-5x10^-4 g. Additionally, this setup offers the opportunity to conduct different kinds of experiments in which the described gravity levels and vacuum conditions are needed.</description>

      <title>XSNAP: An X-ray Supernova Analysis Pipeline with Application to the Type II Supernova 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations of Type II supernovae (SNe II) probe the physics of supernova (SN) shocks and the mass-loss histories of their progenitor stars. We present multi-epoch, X-ray observations of SN II 2024ggi ($D \approx 7.2 \ \rm Mpc$) from ${\it Swift}$-XRT, ${\it Chandra}$ and ${\it XMM}$, which cover $\sim 1 - 344$ days since first light. We analyze these observations using a new open-source Python package called $\texttt{XSNAP}$, which standardizes a unified command-line interface for instrument-specific reduction and spectral extraction. $\texttt{XSNAP}$ introduces application programming interfaces for per-epoch spectral modeling through $\texttt{PyXspec}$ and $\texttt{emcee}$ Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting. We employ ${\tt XSNAP}$ to model the multi-epoch X-ray spectra of SN 2024ggi with an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model and calculate a steady progenitor mass-loss rate of $(6.2\pm0.2)\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ $(v_{\rm wind} = 20 \ \rm km \ s^{-1})$, for which the detected X-ray emission traces the final 117 years before explosion. The software is publicly available on GitHub, with a released package on the Python Package Index (PyPI).</description>

      <title>Indirect forces in disc-planet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded planet is often studied in a frame attached to a central star. This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.</description>

      <title>Historical Surveys to Rubin First Look: Absolute Colors of trans-Neptunian objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric study of transNeptunian objects (TNOs) by combining data from SDSS, Col-OSSOS, DES, and the recent Rubin First Look (RFL) data. Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects.
  From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits.
  Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey.
  We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.</description>

      <title>The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>SPICE -- modelling synthetic spectra of stars with non-homogeneous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of large time-domain spectro-photometric surveys, surface variations such as starspots, chemical inhomogeneities, pulsations, rotational distortions, and binary interactions can now be directly detected and modelled. Accurately interpreting these phenomena requires stellar spectral synthesis frameworks that go beyond the assumption of homogeneous surface properties. Yet most existing tools remain limited by this simplification, hindering their applicability to stars with complex surface structures. To address this need, we present SPICE (SPectral Integration Compiled Engine), an open-source Python package for generating high-resolution spectra and photometry from non-homogeneous stellar surface models. SPICE integrates angle-dependent specific intensities from each surface element, enabling forward modelling of both photometric and spectroscopic variability. Case studies demonstrate applications to spotted stars, Cepheid pulsations, and eclipsing binaries, making SPICE well-suited for analysing current and upcoming survey data. In addition, SPICE can directly import meshes from PHOEBE, enabling the modelling of complex binary configurations beyond these case studies.</description>

      <title>In-situ environmental radiation background measurement in the second phase of CJPL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory worldwide, provides a low radiation background environment, which is necessary to frontier scientific research, such as the experimental studies of rare-event physics. Due to the almost filled space of CJPL-I and the requirement of future physics experiments, the construction of the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) was started in 2020 and all finished in 2024. In this work, we report the measured results of major environmental radiation in CJPL-II, including cosmic-ray muons, radon, gamma rays, and neutrons. Results indicate that the rock overburden and the radioactive background control effectively minimize the environmental radiation background. The scientific data presented also serve as an important basis to detector background modeling for the physics experiments in CJPL-II.</description>

      <title>Measurement of cosmic-ray muon flux at CJPL-II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory globally, the cosmic-ray muon flux is significantly reduced due to the substantial shielding provided by the overlying mountain. From 2016 to 2020, we measured the muon flux in the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) with a plastic scintillator muon telescope system, detecting 161 muon events over an effective live time of 1098 days. The detection efficiency was obtained by simulating the underground muon energy and angular distributions and the telescope system's response to underground muons. The cosmic-ray muon flux is determined to be (3.03 $\pm$ 0.24 (stat) $\pm$ 0.18 (sys)) $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is the lowest among underground laboratories worldwide.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics in pkdgrav3 for Shock Physics Simulations I: Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present pkdgrav3, a high-performance, fully parallel tree-SPH code designed for large-scale hydrodynamic simulations including self-gravity. Building upon the long development history of pkdgrav, the code combines an efficient hierarchical tree algorithm for gravity and neighbor finding with a modern implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) optimized for massively parallel hybrid CPU/GPU architectures. Its hybrid shared/distributed memory model, combined with an asynchronous communication scheme, allows pkdgrav3 to scale efficiently to thousands of CPU cores and GPUs. We validate the numerical accuracy of pkdgrav3 using a suite of standard tests, demonstrating excellent agreement with analytic or reference solutions. The code was already used in several peer-reviewed publications to model planetary-scale impacts, where SPH's Lagrangian nature allows accurate tracking of material origin and thermodynamic evolution. These examples highlight pkdgrav3's robustness and efficiency in simulating highly dynamical, self-gravitating systems. pkdgrav3 thus provides a powerful, flexible, and scalable platform for astrophysical and planetary applications, capable of exploiting the full potential of modern heterogeneous high-performance computing systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimension Estimation for Radio Galaxy Zoo using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>An optical--mid-infrared color evolution tool for nova identification using WISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for characterizing nova candidates by exploiting the infrared capabilities of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalog. We developed a pipeline to identify novae based on well-defined infrared criteria, and leveraging this pipeline, we successfully identified 41 optically confirmed novae in the WISE catalog. In particular, we focus on the color difference between the optical V band and the WISE 3.4 microns W1 band as a diagnostic. We compared their infrared light curves with their optical counterparts. We identified a strong correlation from which we proposed a color difference model that can be used for further identification and characterization of novae. Our analysis validates the mass-loss timescale theory, which predicts that systems with lower accretion rates accumulate larger envelopes and produce more massive ejecta. We also confirm models' prediction that the early color evolution of novae is governed by ejecta expansion and cooling. From our sample statistics, we infer a Galactic nova rate of approximately 40 to 50 novae per year, consistent with modern and infrared-corrected estimates. The resultant model from this work paves the way for future large-scale investigations of nova candidates.</description>

      <title>First Use of GPS Satellites for Beam Calibration of Radio Dish Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from the first application of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS; e.g., the Global Positioning System, GPS) for radio beam calibration using a commercial GNSS receiver with the Deep Dish Development Array (D3A) at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO). Several GNSS satellites pass through the main and sidelobes of the beam each day, enabling efficient mapping of the 2D beam structure. Due to the high SNR and abundance of GNSS satellites, we find evidence that GNSS can probe several sidelobes of the beam through repeatable measurements of the beam over several days. Over three days of measurements, the smallest observed difference in the primary beam's main lobe was 0.56 dB-Hz. We also compare our results in the sidelobes to simulations and find rough agreement in shape. When scaling the observations and simulations to match in the main lobe power levels, we find deviations in at least one of the first few nulls of approximately 5 dB or less. There is saturation in the main lobe for most satellites, which can likely be mitigated by better attenuation before the receiver input. We compare our work to other satellite systems that have been successful and are likely complementary to this technique. However, GNSS offers key advantages, including continuous transmission, broader frequency coverage relevant to CHORD, SKA-mid, and the DSA-2000, as well as more frequent satellite passes, making it a promising calibration method. These results also motivate further development of this technique for radio astronomy applications.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Nuclear Recoils in Silicon Crystals towards Single Electron-Hole Pair Ionization Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a novel methodology utilizing molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the ionization yields of nuclear recoils in crystalline silicon. This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise, are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency. FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis, offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.</description>

      <title>Transformers for Stratified Spectropolarimetric Inversion: Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We explore attention maps, linking the transformer's learned behaviour to line-formation physics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Model Framework for Reconstructing Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) is crucial for cosmological research, enhancing the precision of parameters, assuming perfect satellite conditions for complete LC coverage with no gaps. This analysis improves the applicability of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation, which connects the rest-frame end time of the plateau emission (Ta) and its luminosity (La), derived from the fluxes (Fa). The study expands on a previous 521 GRB sample by incorporating seven models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid CNN with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting, Isotonic Regression, and Quartic Smoothing Spline (QSS). Results indicate that QSS significantly reduces uncertainty across parameters: 43.5% for log Ta, 43.2% for log Fa, and 48.3% for alpha, outperforming the other models where alpha denotes the slope post-plateau based on Willingale 2007 functional form. The Polynomial Curve Fitting model demonstrates moderate uncertainty reduction across parameters, while CNN-BiLSTM has the lowest outlier rate for alpha at 0.77%. These models broaden the application of machine-learning techniques in GRB LC analysis, enhancing uncertainty estimation and parameter recovery, and complement traditional methods like the Attention U-Net and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These advancements highlight the potential of GRBs as cosmological probes, supporting their role in theoretical model discrimination via LC parameters, serving as standard candles, and facilitating GRB redshift predictions through advanced machine-learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation LXXIX. Using mock low surface brightness dwarf galaxies to probe Euclid Wide Survey detection capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local Universe dwarf galaxies can serve as both cosmological and mass assembly probes. Deep surveys have enabled the study of these objects down to the low surface brightness (LSB) regime. In this paper, we estimate Euclid's dwarf detection capabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline), which is responsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this, we injected mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the VIS band and compared the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock dwarf galaxies were generated using simple Sersic models with structural parameters (including size and surface brightness) drawn from observed dwarf galaxy catalogues. These simulations represent an idealised case in the sense they do not account for additional factors such as ellipticity, morphology, or crowding. To characterise the detected dwarfs, we used the mean surface brightness inside the effective radius SB_e (in mag arcsec^-2). The final MER catalogues achieve completenesses of 91% for SB_e in [21,24] and 54% for SB_e in [24,28]. These numbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion with background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking those effects into account, they respectively became 86% and 38%. The MER pipeline performs a final local background subtraction with a small mesh size, leading to a flux loss for galaxies with R_e &gt; 10 arcsec. By using the final MER mosaics and reinjecting this local background, we obtained an image in which we recover reliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale. This background-reinjected product is thus suitable for the study of Local Universe dwarf galaxies. Euclid's data reduction pipeline serves as a test bed for other deep surveys, particularly regarding background subtraction methods, a key issue in LSB science.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Dust-Catalyzed Molecular Hydrogen Formation Enabled by Nuclear Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) plays a critical role in astrophysical processes from galaxy evolution to the formation of planets. While the dominant formation channel in the interstellar medium is considered as dust-catalyzed H$_2$ formation, this process could become inefficient at low temperatures suppressed by the Boltzmann factor. This work demonstrates that quantum tunneling can dominate the formation of H$_2$, resolving the long-standing problem of formation efficiency. Path integral Monte Carlo simulations reveals that the quantum tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains stable reaction rates at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations further indicate that the actual H$_2$ formation efficiency is governed not by atomic diffusion, but rather by the energy barriers associated with chemisorption, desorption, and the association of two hydrogen atoms. These findings establish a robust physical basis for dust-catalyzed H$_2$ formation, offer quantitative reaction rates for refining astrophysical models, and provide a framework for interpreting observations of interstellar molecular materials.</description>

      <title>ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz) and S250818k: A Candidate Superkilonova from a Sub-threshold Sub-Solar Gravitational Wave Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Perspective on Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DESI collaboration reports a significant preference for a dynamic dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM) over the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM) when their data are combined with other frontier cosmological probes. We present a direct Bayesian model comparison using nested sampling to compute the Bayesian evidence, revealing a contrasting conclusion: for the key combination of the DESI DR2 BAO and the Planck CMB data, we find the Bayesian evidence modestly favours $\Lambda$CDM (log-Bayes factor $\ln B = -0.57{\scriptstyle\pm0.26}$), in contrast to the collaboration's 3.1$\sigma$ frequentist significance in favoring $w_0w_a$CDM. Extending this analysis to also combine with the DES-Y5 supernova catalogue, our Bayesian analysis reaches a significance of $3.07{\scriptstyle\pm0.10}\,\sigma$ in favour of $w_0w_a$CDM. By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\approx 2.95\sigma$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict. The convergence of our findings with independent geometric analyses suggests that the preference for dynamic dark energy is primarily driven by the resolution of inter-dataset tensions, warranting a cautious interpretation of its statistical significance.</description>

      <title>Flexible Simulation Based Inference for Galaxy Photometric Fitting with Synthesizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Synference, a new, flexible Python framework for galaxy SED fitting using simulation-based inference (SBI). Synference leverages the Synthesizer package for flexible forward-modelling of galaxy SEDs and integrates the LtU-ILI package to ensure best practices in model training and validation. In this work we demonstrate Synference by training a neural posterior estimator on $10^6$ simulated galaxies, based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, to infer galaxy properties from 14-band HST and JWST photometry. We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R$^2&gt;$0.99 for M$_\star$) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in $\sim$3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a $\sim$1700$\times$ speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques. We demonstrate Synference's ability to simultaneously infer photometric redshifts and physical parameters, and highlight its utility for rapid Bayesian model comparison by demonstrating systematic stellar mass differences between two commonly used stellar population synthesis models. Synference is a powerful, scalable tool poised to maximise the scientific return of next-generation galaxy surveys.</description>
