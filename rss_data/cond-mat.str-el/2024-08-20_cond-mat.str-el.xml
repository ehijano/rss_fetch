      <title>Discovery of terahertz-frequency orbitally-coupled magnons in a kagome ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ferromagnetic materials, magnons - quanta of spin waves - typically resonate in the gigahertz range. Beyond conventional magnons, while theoretical studies have predicted magnons associated with orbital magnetic moments, their direct observation has remained challenging. Here, we present the discovery of two distinct terahertz orbitally-coupled magnon resonances in the topological kagome ferromagnet Co3Sn2S2. Using time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy, we pinpoint two magnon resonances at 0.61 and 0.49 THz at 6 K, surpassing all previously reported magnon resonances in ferromagnets due to strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These dual modes originate from the strong coupling of localized spin and orbital magnetic moments. These findings unveil a novel category of magnons stemming from orbital magnetic moments, and position Co3Sn2S2 as a promising candidate for high-speed terahertz spintronic applications</description>

      <title>Chemical versus physical pressure effects on the structure transition of bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of high-$T_c$ superconductivity (HTSC) in concomitant with pressure-induced orthorhombic-tetragonal structural transition in the bilayer La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has sparked hopes of achieving HTSC by stabilizing the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure. To mimic the effect of external physical pressures, the application of chemical pressure via replacing La$^3$$^+$ with smaller rare-earth R$^3$$^+$ has been considered as a potential route. Here we clarify the distinct effects of chemical and physical pressures on the structural transition of bilayer nickelates through a combined experimental and theoretical investigation. Contrary to general expectations, we find that substitutions of smaller R$^3$$^+$ for La$^3$$^+$ in La$_{3-x}$R$_x$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, despite of an overall lattice contraction, produce stronger orthorhombic structural distortions and thus require higher pressures to induce the structural transition. We established a quantitative relationship between the critical pressure $P_c$ for structural transition and the average size of $A$-site cations. A linear extrapolation of $P_c$ versus &lt;$r_A$&gt; yields a putative critical value of &lt;$r_A$&gt;$_c$ ~ 1.23 angstrom for $P_c$ ~ 1 bar. The negative correlation between $P_c$ and &lt;$r_A$&gt; indicates that it is unlikely to reduce $P_c$ to ambient by replacing La$^3$$^+$ with smaller R$^3$$^+$ ions. Instead, partial substitution of La$^3$$^+$ with larger cations such as alkaline-earth Sr$^2$$^+$ or Ba$^2$$^+$ might be a feasible approach. Our results provide valuable guidelines in the quest of ambient-pressure HTSC in bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Zeeman field induced corner states in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the in-plane Zeeman field and the Hubbard interaction can jointly affect the topological states in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. At low Zeeman field, the projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) simulations demonstrate Mott transitions between the higher-order topological insulator induced by the in-plane Zeeman field and the antiferromagnetic insulator induced by the Hubbard interaction. The interacting higher-order topological state on a finite-sized honeycomb lattice is characterized by the local density of states derived from the real-space spectral function. In the higher-order topological phase, the mirror-inversion symmetry protected corner states exist on the diamond-shaped honeycomb lattice. By comparing the spatial distribution of corner states between the Kane-Mele and Kane-Mele-Hubbard models, we show that the effect of the Hubbard interaction is to contribute some extra in-plane Zeeman field. At the mean-field level, we calculate the full phase diagram of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model under the influence of the in-plane Zeeman field. The mean-field phase diagram shows that a high in-plane Zeeman field drives the system into a spin-polarized (topologically trivial) phase. In particular, the upper limit of the Zeeman field that can induce corner states in the Kane-Mele model is found to be $h_c = 1.0(3)$. In the parameter region of PQMC simulations, the mean-field solutions are in fair agreement with the PQMC results.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Magnetism in the Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet KErTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the discovery of the ARECh2 (A=alkali or monovalent ions, RE=rare-earth, Ch= chalcogen) triangular lattice quantum spin liquid (QSL) family, a series of its oxide, sulfide, and selenide counterparts has been consistently reported and extensively investigated. While KErTe2 represents the initial synthesized telluride member, preserving its triangular spin lattice, it was anticipated that the substantial tellurium ions could impart more pronounced magnetic attributes and electronic structures to this material class. This study delves into the magnetism of KErTe2 at finite temperatures through magnetization and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. Based on the angular momentum $\hat{J}$ after spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and symmetry analysis, we obtain the magnetic effective Hamiltonian to describe the magnetism of Er3+ in R-3m space group. Applying the mean-field approximation to the Hamiltonian, we can simulate the magnetization and magnetic heat capacity of KErTe2 in paramagnetic state and determine the crystalline electric field (CEF) parameters and partial exchange interactions. The relatively narrow energy gaps between CEF ground state and excited states exert a significant influence on the magnetism. For example, small CEF excitations can result in a significant broadening of the ESR linewidth at 2 K. For the fitted exchange interactions, although the values are small, given a large angular momentum J = 15/2 after SOC, they still have a noticeable effect at finite temperatures. Notably, the heat capacity data under different magnetic fields along the c-axis direction also roughly match our calculated results, further validating the reliability of our analytical approach. These derived parameters serve as crucial tools for future investigations into the ground state magnetism of KErTe2.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral function and nonequilibrium dynamics of the strongly interacting Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical results on the correlation functions of strongly correlated many-body systems are rare in the literature and their importance cannot be overstated. We present determinant representations for the space-, time-, and temperature-dependent correlation functions of the strongly interacting one-dimensional Hubbard model in the presence of an external trapping potential. These representations are exact and valid in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios like the ones initiated by a sudden change of the confinement potential. In addition, they can be implemented numerically very easily significantly outperforming other numerical approaches. As applications of our results we investigate the single particle spectral functions of systems with harmonic trapping and show that dynamical quasicondensation occurs for both fermionic and bosonic spin-$1/2$ systems released from a Mott insulator state.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Kondo lattice quantum critical point and of non-Fermi liquid behavior in the intercalated layered system V$_{5}$S$_{8}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of a specific heat, susceptibility and high-pressure electrical resistivity study, we show that the local magnetic moments of the intercalated V ions in V$_{5}$S$_{8}$ realize a prototype of Kondo lattice system, where an antiferromagnetic order of the moments coexists with a Fermi liquid in the VS$_{2}$ layers with intermediate heavy Fermion properties. The antiferromagnetic order and the Fermi-liquid behavior are simultaneously suppressed at a critical pressure, $P_c =10$ GPa, signature of a quantum critical point, which supports a Kondo lattice scenario and raises the question whether, in the paramagnetic phase at higher pressures, the heavy quasiparticles survive or form a non-Fermi liquid phase governed by the Kondo interaction.</description>

      <title>Imaging ultrafast electronic domain fluctuations with X-ray speckle visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speckle patterns manifesting from the interaction of coherent X-rays with matter offer a glimpse into the dynamics of nanoscale domains that underpin many emergent phenomena in quantum materials. While the dynamics of the average structure can be followed with time-resolved X-ray diffraction, the ultrafast evolution of local structures in nonequilibrium conditions have thus far eluded detection due to experimental limitations, such as insufficient X-ray coherent flux. Here we demonstrate a nonequilibrium speckle visibility experiment using a split-and-delay setup at an X-ray free-electron laser. Photoinduced electronic domain fluctuations of the magnetic model material Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$ reveal changes of the trimeron network configuration due to charge dynamics that exhibit liquid-like fluctuations, analogous to a supercooled liquid phase. This suggests that ultrafast dynamics of electronic heterogeneities under optical stimuli are fundamentally different from thermally-driven ones.</description>

      <title>Helical edge modes in a triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of helical edge modes in a Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice, driven by a topological mechanism similar to that proposed by Dong et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 206701 (2023)] for chiral spin waves in ferromagnets. The spin-frame field theory of a three-sublattice antiferromagnet allows for a topological term in the energy that modifies the boundary conditions for certain polarizations of spin waves and gives rise to edge modes. These edge modes are helical: modes with left and right circular polarizations propagate in opposite directions along the boundary in a way reminiscent of the electron edge modes in two-dimensional topological insulators. The field-theoretic arguments are verified in a realistic lattice model of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with superexchange interactions that exhibits helical edge modes. The strength of the topological term is proportional to the disparity between two inequivalent superexchange paths. These findings suggest potential avenues for realizing magnonic edge states in frustrated antiferromagnets without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions or nontrivial magnon band topology.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic excitonic magnetism from discrete $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ symmetry in CeRhIn$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropy in strongly correlated materials is a central parameter in determining the electronic ground state and is tuned through the local crystalline electric field. This is notably the case in the CeCo$_{x}$Rh$_{1-x}$In$_{5}$ system where the ground-state wave function can provide the basis for antiferromagnetism and/or unconventional superconductivity. We develop a methodology to understand the local magnetic anisotropy and experimentally investigate with neutron spectroscopy applied to antiferromagnetic ($T_{N}$=3.8 K) CeRhIn$_{5}$ which is isostructural to $d$-wave superconducting ($T_{c}$=2.3 K) CeCoIn$_{5}$. Through diagonalizing the local crystal field Hamiltonian with discrete tetragonal $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ point group symmetry and coupling these states with the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), we find two distinct modes polarized along the crystallographic $c$ and $a-b$ planes, agreeing with experiment. The anisotropy and bandwidth, underlying the energy scale of these modes, are tuneable with a magnetic field which we use experimentally to separate in energy single and multiparticle excitations thereby demonstrating the instability of excitations polarized within the crystallographic $a-b$ plane in CeRhIn$_{5}$. We compare this approach to a $S_{eff}={1\over 2}$ parameterizations and argue for the need to extend conventional SU(2) theories of magnetic excitations to utilize the multi-level nature of the underlying crystal-field basis states constrained by the local point-group $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ from topology-induced quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, superconductivity has been observed in twisted WSe$_2$ moir\'{e} structures (Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418). Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which experience quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band' natural tendency towards static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.</description>

      <title>Covariant Jacobi-Legendre expansion for total energy calculations within the projector-augmented-wave formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning models can be trained to predict the converged electron charge density of a density functional theory (DFT) calculation. In general, the value of the density at a given point in space is invariant under global translations and rotations having that point as a centre. Hence, one can construct locally invariant machine-learning density predictors. However, the widely used projector augmented wave (PAW) implementation of DFT requires the evaluation of the one-center augmentation contributions, that are not rotationally invariant. Building on our recently proposed Jacobi-Legendre charge-density scheme, we construct a covariant Jacobi-Legendre model capable of predicting the local occupancies needed to compose the augmentation charge density. Our formalism is then applied to the prediction of the energy barrier for the 1H-to-1T phase transition of two-dimensional MoS$_2$. With extremely modest training, the model is capable of performing a non-self-consistent nudged elastic band calculation at virtually the same accuracy as a fully DFT-converged one, thus saving thousands of self-consistent DFT steps. Furthermore, at variance with machine-learning force fields, the charge density is here available for any nudged elastic band image, so that we can trace the evolution of the electronic structure across the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth and characterization of Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ (0.5 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1) from LiCl/KCl flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An eutectic LiCl/KCl flux method in a horizontal configuration has been used to grow a series of homogeneous Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ single crystals of high quality with 0.5 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1. Compared with previously used melt-growth method, the stable crystallization process in LiCl/KCl flux below their peritectic temperatures results in better homogeneity and crystalline perfection identified by energy dispersive spectrometer and x-ray diffraction. The interstitial Fe value $\delta$ remains small within 0.5 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.85 where the superconducting temperature $T_C$ is not sensitive to the Te content with sharp superconducting transition widths $\Delta$$T_C$ &lt; 1 K and a maximum of $T_C$ = 14.3 K at $x$ = 0.61. The value $\delta$ starts to increase quickly accompanied by a deviation of linear behavior of crystal lattice parameters as well as the broadening of $\Delta$$T_C$ = 2.1 K at $x$ = 0.91, then suddenly rises up to $\delta$ &gt; 0.1 followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and emergence of antiferromagnetic order at x $\geq$ 0.96. We also observed a metallic to semiconducting transition in the normal state resistivity of Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ with increasing Te content which is related to a localized electronic state induced by the interstitial Fe. The interstitial Fe value $\delta$ might be a key physical parameter to understand various properties of Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ system.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Steady State Full Counting Statistics in the Noncrossing Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport is often characterized not just by mean observables like the particle or energy current, but by their fluctuations and higher moments, which can act as detailed probes of the physical mechanisms at play. However, relatively few theoretical methods are able to access the full counting statistics (FCS) of transport processes through electronic junctions in strongly correlated regimes. While most experiments are concerned with the steady state properties, most accurate theoretical methods rely on computationally expensive propagation from a tractable initial state. Here, we propose a simple approach for computing the FCS through a junction directly at the steady state, utilizing the propagator noncrossing approximation (NCA). Compared to time propagation, our method offers reduced computational cost at the same level of approximation; but the idea can also be used within other approximations or as a basis for numerically exact techniques. We demonstrate the method's capabilities by investigating the impact of lead dimensionality on electronic transport in the nonequilibrium Anderson impurity model at the onset of Kondo physics. Our results reveal a distinct signature of one dimensional leads in the noise and Fano factor not present for other dimensionalities, showing the potential of FCS measurements as a probe of the environment surrounding a quantum dot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitary transformations play a fundamental role in many-body physics, and except for special cases, they are not expressible in closed form. We present closed-form expressions for unitary transformations generated by a single fermionic operator for Hermitian and anti-Hermitian generators. We demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary transformations and numerical applications involving block-diagonalization and Heisenberg dynamics. This work paves the way for new analytical treatments of unitary transformations and numerical many-body methods for fermions.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Free-Parafermion Solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.</description>

      <title>Two-component superconductivity and strange metallicity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: A Schwinger boson study of the $t$-$V$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has stimulated intensive investigations concerning its effective low-energy theory. One promising scenario is the $t$-$V$-$J$ model proposed in [Phys. Rev. B $\mathbf{108}$, L201108 (2023)], which attributes the superconductivity to the local interlayer $d_{z^2}$ spin singlets and their hybridization with the metallic $d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands. Using the Schwinger boson approach to the $t$-$V$-$J$ model, a global phase diagram is obtained with metallic and superconducting ground states separated by a quantum phase transition. We predict a minimal $d_{z^2}$-hole concentration necessary for the superconductivity and a maximum $T_c$ in good consistency with experiments. The normal state is featured with a pseudogap in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ spectra associated with preformed Cooper pairs and non-Fermi liquid behaviors due to the hybridization-induced spinon-holon-electron scattering. Our work provides a consistent understanding of the superconductivity and strange metallic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and clarifies the key difference of the two-component scenario from others.</description>

      <title>Diverse Impacts of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering non-Abelian quasiparticles by combining superconductivity and topological states have been proposed as a route to realize topological quantum computation. Rhombohedral multilayer graphene with layer number N&gt;=3 has been shown as a promising platform, as it hosts integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects when proximitized by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) and a moire potential. However, superconductivity in similar devices have remained largely unexplored, although proximitized spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) effect has been shown to strengthen or induce superconductivity in both crystalline and twisted graphene. Here we report electron transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) at temperatures down to 40 mK. We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with a transition temperature Tc of 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase. Near this three-quarter-metal state, the state SC3, very weak in bare RTG, is fully developed into a superconducting state at 110 mK. By performing fermiology analysis based on the quantum oscillation measurement, we showed that the SC3 and SC4 states reside at the phase boundaries between different isospin-symmetry-breaking states. These observations are aligned with the existing understanding that SOC enhances graphene superconductivity. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD, and we cannot find it down to the base temperature of our measurement. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices, and provide experimental evidence that challenges the understanding of the impacts of SOC on graphene superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibirum dynamics of a quantum many-body system is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We simulate the time evolution of one-dimensional ${\bf Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm\_fez. We consider the Floquet circuit made of the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian evolution and focus on its dynamics toward thermalization. Quantum simulation with the help of error mitigation is successful in running the Floquet circuit made of $38$ and $116$ qubits up to $10$ Trotter steps in the best case. This is enough to reach the early stage of prethermalization. Our work would be a benchmark for the potential power of quantum computing for high-energy physics problems.</description>

      <title>Interplay of electronic crystals with integer and fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e pentalayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of moir\'e quantum matter has recently led to the remarkable discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect, and sparked predictions of other novel correlation-driven topological states. Here, we investigate the interplay of electronic crystals with integer and fractional Chern insulators in a moir\'e lattice of rhomobohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At a doping of one electron per moir\'e unit cell, we see a correlated insulator with a Chern number that can be tuned between $C=0$ and $+1$ by an electric displacement field, accompanied by an array of other such insulators formed at fractional band fillings, $\nu$. Collectively, these states likely correspond to trivial and topological electronic crystals, some of which spontaneously break the discrete translational symmetry of the moir\'e lattice. Upon applying a modest magnetic field, a narrow region forms around $\nu=2/3$ in which transport measurements imply the emergence of a fractional Chern insulator, along with hints of weaker states at other fractional $\nu$. In the same sample, we also see a unique sequence of incipient Chern insulators arising over a broad range of incommensurate band filling near two holes per moir\'e unit cell. Our results establish moir\'e RPG as a fertile platform for studying the competition and potential intertwining of electronic crystallization and topological charge fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Kitaev honeycomb antiferromagnet in a field: quantum phase diagram for general spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine tensor-network approaches and high-order linked-cluster expansions to investigate the quantum phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev's honeycomb model in a magnetic field for general spin values. For the pure Kitaev model, tensor network calculations confirm the absence of fluxes and spin-spin correlations beyond nearest neighbor in the ground state, but signal a breaking of the discrete orientational symmetry for $S\in\{1,3/2,2\}$ inline with the semiclassical limit. An intermediate region between Kitaev phases and the high-field polarized phase is demonstrated for all considered spin values. In this intermediate region the tensor network results display a sequence of potential phases whose number increases with the spin value. Each of these can be characterized by distinct local magnetization patterns while the total magnetization increases smoothly as a function of the field. The analysis of the high-field zero-momentum gap and the associated spectral weight of the polarized phase for general spin $S$ obtained by linked-cluster expansions is consistent with an unconventional quantum critical breakdown of the high-field polarized phase in accordance with the presence of exotic physics at intermediate Kitaev couplings.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Correlated Two-dimensional Topological Insulators through Fermionic Tensor Network States -- Classification, Edge Theories and Variational Wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of topological band insulators has revealed fascinating phases characterized by band topology indices and anomalous boundary modes protected by global symmetries. In strongly correlated systems, where the traditional notion of electronic bands becomes obsolete, it has been established that the topological insulator phases persist as stable phases, separate from the trivial insulators. However, due to the inability to express the ground states of such systems as Slater determinants, the formulation of generic variational wavefunctions for numerical simulations is highly desirable.
  In this paper, we tackle this challenge for two-dimensional topological insulators by developing a comprehensive framework for fermionic tensor network states. Starting from simple assumptions, we obtain possible sets of tensor equations for any given symmetry group, capturing consistent relations governing symmetry transformation rules on tensor legs. We then examine the connections between these tensor equations and non-chiral topological insulators by construing edge theories and extracting quantum anomaly data from each set of tensor equations. By exhaustively exploring all possible sets of equations, we achieve a systematic classification of non-chiral topological insulator phases. Imposing the solutions of a given set of equations onto local tensors, we obtain generic variational wavefunctions for corresponding topological insulator phases. Our methodology provides an important step towards simulating topological insulators in strongly correlated systems. We discuss the limitations and potential generalizations of our results, paving the way for further advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene I: Interaction-Driven Chern Bands and Fractional Quantum Hall States at Zero Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on rhombohedral pentalayer graphene flakes with a substrate induced moir\'e potential have identified both Chern insulators and fractional Quantum Hall states in the absence of an applied magnetic field. Surprisingly, these states are observed in strong displacement fields where the effects of the moir\'e lattice are weak, and seem to be readily accessed without fine-tuning. To address these experimental puzzles we study an interacting model of electrons in this geometry, first within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (SCHF) approximation. We find an isolated Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$, that moreover is relatively flat and shows good quantum geometry. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods at fractional filling establish the presence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states. The $|C|=1$ band in SCHF is remarkably robust to varying microscopic parameters, and is also found in the $N_L=4$ and $N_L=6$ layer systems. Remarkably, it appears stable even to switching off the moir\'e potential, pointing to spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry. We term this topological crystalline state the ``anomalous Hall crystal" (AHC), and argue that it constitutes a general mechanism for creating stable Chern bands in rhombohedral graphene. Our work elucidates the physics behind the recent rhombohedral pentalayer graphene observations, predicts the appearance of the same phase in other systems, and opens the door to studying the interplay between electronic topology and spontaneous translation symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet patching, 1-form symmetries, and "Landau-star" phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions of gauge theories has relied heavily on simplifications that arise at the boundaries of phase diagrams, where certain excitations are forbidden. Taking 2+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory as an example, the simplification can be visualized geometrically: on the phase diagram boundaries the partition function is an ensemble of closed membranes. More generally, however, the membranes have "holes" in them, representing worldlines of virtual anyon excitations. If the holes are of a finite size, then typically they do not affect the universality class, but they destroy microscopic (higher-form) symmetries and microscopic (string) observables. We demonstrate how these symmetries and observables can be restored using a "membrane patching" procedure, which maps the ensemble of membranes back to an ensemble of closed membranes. (This is closely related to the idea of gauge fixing in the "minimal gauge", though not equivalent.) Membrane patching makes the emergence of higher symmetry concrete. Performing patching in a Monte Carlo simulation with an appropriate algorithm, we show that it gives access to numerically useful observables. For example, the confinement transition can be analyzed using a correlation function that is a power law at the critical point. We analyze the quasi-locality of the patching procedure and discuss what happens at a self-dual multicritical point in the gauge-Higgs model, where the lengthscale $\ell$ characterizing the holes diverges.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical spin dynamics across temperature scales in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: Using the framework of semi-classical Landau-Lifshitz dynamics (LLD), we conduct a systematic investigation of the temperature-dependent spin dynamics in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg square-lattice antiferromagnet (SqAF). By performing inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Zn2VO(PO4)2 (ZVPO) and corresponding finite-temperature spin dynamics simulations based on LLD, we present a comprehensive analysis that bridges quantum and classical spin dynamics over a broad temperature range. First, a remarkable agreement between experimental data and LLD simulations is found in the paramagnetic phase of ZVPO, demonstrating the capability of LLD in accurately determining the spin Hamiltonian of S = 1/2 systems and capturing the quantum-to-classical crossover of their spin dynamics. Second, by analyzing the discrepancies between the experimental data and the LLD simulations at lower temperatures, we determine the experimental temperature dependence of the quantum effects in the excitation spectrum of the S = 1/2 SqAF: the quantum renormalization factor for the magnon energies and the quantum continuum above the one-magnon bands. Notably, the emergence of each quantum effect is found to correlate with the formation of three-dimensional long-range order. This work demonstrates the utility of LLD in gaining experimental insights into the temperature-induced modifications of quantum spin dynamics and their convergence towards classical expectations at higher temperatures. This motivates further applications to more challenging quantum antiferromagnets dominated by stronger quantum fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: The manifold of energetically degenerate configurations arising from competing interactions in frustrated magnets gives rise to an enhanced entropy at lowest temperatures, which can be utilized for adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR). We review structural and magnetic properties of various Yb- and Gd-based oxides featuring frustration related to different triangular moment configurations and (in some cases) structural randomness. In comparison to paramagnetic hydrated salts, which have traditionally been employed for mK-ADR, these novel ADR materials enable cooling to temperatures several times lower than the magnetic interaction strength, significantly enhancing the entropy density and cooling power at a given target temperature. A further advantage is their chemical stability, allowing for a much simpler ADR pill design and ultra-high vacuum applications. For the temperature range between 0.02 and 2 K, a systematic comparison of the field-induced entropy density change is provided, that illustrates the advantages of frustrated magnets for low-temperature ADR.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and optical conductivity in a two-valley system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical conductivity of a Fermi liquid (FL) in the absence of umklapp scattering is dramatically affected by the topology of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically, electron-electron (ee) scattering leads to rapid current relaxation in systems with multiple, or multiply connected, FSs, provided the valleys have different effective masses. This effect results from intervalley drag. We microscopically derive the optical conductivity of a two-valley system, both within the FL regime and near a quantum critical point (QCP) of the Ising-nematic type. In the FL regime, intervalley drag restores the Gurzhi-like scaling of the conductivity, $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^0$. This dependence contrasts sharply with the previously identified sub-leading contribution to the conductivity of a two-dimensional FL with a single convex FS, where $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^2 \ln |\omega|$. The vanishing of the leading term in the optical conductivity is a signature of geometric constraints on ee scattering channels, which are lifted for a multiply connected FS. A large differential response, $d \mathrm{Re} \sigma/d \mu$ with $\mu$ being the chemical potential, is predicted at the Lifshitz transition from a single-valley to a multi-valley FS, which should be observable within the experimentally accessible frequency range. Near a QCP, intervalley drag leads to a $|\omega|^{-2/3}$ scaling of $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega)$ in 2D, thus providing a specific current-relaxing process for this long-standing conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions of metals involve changes in the Fermi surface, and can be divided into three categories. The first two categories involve symmetry breaking, and lead to a deformation or reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The third category involves a change in the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface without any symmetry breaking: one phase is a Fermi liquid (FL) with the conventional Luttinger volume, while the other phase is a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*), which has a non-Luttinger volume Fermi surface accompanied by a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. It is a relatively simple matter to obtain a FL*-FL transition in Kondo lattice models. However, the FL*-FL transition can also be present in single-band Hubbard-like models: this is efficiently described by the `ancilla' method, which shows that the transition is a `flipped' Kondo lattice transition. This single-band FL*-FL transition is argued to apply to the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprates. In the clean limit, the critical properties of the quantum transitions in the three categories are distinct, but all lead to perfect metal transport in the quantum-critical regime. Impurity-induced `Harris disorder', with spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point, is a relevant perturbation to the clean critical points. In the presence of Harris disorder, all three categories exhibit strange metal behavior, which can be described by a universal two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Hall plateaus at quarter fillings occur in GaAs wide quantum wells, hole-doped GaAs, and bilayer graphene. However, the interactions favoring incompressible states over compressible composite-Fermi liquids at such fillings are not well understood. We devise a method of computing the trial energies for Haldane pseudopotentials via Monte Carlo sampling. Applying it to the quarter-filled lowest Landau level, we find that tuning the third and fifth pseudopotential can stabilize anti-Pfaffian, Moore-Read, and f-wave states. The smallest deviations from pure Coulomb interactions are required by anti-Pfaffian, whose presence is indicated by daughter states in recent experiments of bilayer graphene at $\nu=\frac{3}{4}$.</description>

Abstract: We apply a wavefunction approach to study the charge 4$e$ superconductor. The wavefunction takes a similar structure to the BCS wavefunction for charge 2$e$ superconductors. The mean-field Hamiltonian and the Green's functions of charge 4$e$ are constructed. The physical properties including the density of states, gauge invariance, flux quantization, superfluid density and Josephson effects are systematically studied. All these results form a microscopic description of the charge 4$e$ SC and can be served as the hallmarks for experimental verifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove fundamental rigorous bounds on the speed of quantum evolution for a quantum system coupled to a thermal bath. The bounds are formulated in terms of expectation values of few-body observables derived from the system-bath Hamiltonian. They do not rely on the Markov approximation and, as a consequence, are applicable beyond the limit of weak system-bath coupling.</description>

      <title>Shot noise as a diagnostic in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall edge zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\nu = 2/3$ filling is the simplest paradigmatic example of a fractional quantum Hall state, which contains counter-propagating edge modes. These modes can be either in the unequilibrated regime or equilibrated to different extents, on top of a possible edge reconstruction. In the unequilibrated regime, two distinct renormalization group fixed points have been previously proposed, namely Kane-Fischer-Polchinski and Wang-Meir-Gefen. In the equilibration regime, different degree of thermal equilibration may occur, while charge is fully equilibrated. Here, we show that this rich variety of models can give rise to three possible conductance plateaus at $e^2/2h$ (recently observed in experiments), $5e^2/9h$ (predicted here), and $e^2/3h$ (observed earlier in experiments) in a quantum point contact geometry. We identify different mechanisms for \emph{electrical shot noise} generation at these plateaus, which provides an experimentally accessible venue for distinguishing among the distinct models.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation from dynamic automorphism codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model of quantum computation comprised of low-weight measurement sequences that simultaneously encode logical information, enable error correction, and apply logical gates. These measurement sequences constitute a new class of quantum error-correcting codes generalizing Floquet codes, which we call dynamic automorphism (DA) codes. We construct an explicit example, the DA color code, which is assembled from short measurement sequences that can realize all 72 automorphisms of the 2D color code. On a stack of $N$ triangular patches, the DA color code encodes $N$ logical qubits and can implement the full logical Clifford group by a sequence of two- and, more rarely, three-qubit Pauli measurements. We also make the first step towards universal quantum computation with DA codes by introducing a 3D DA color code and showing that a non-Clifford logical gate can be realized by adaptive two-qubit measurements.</description>

      <title>Fractional Topological Charges in 2D Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions are characterised by an integer topological charge $\mathcal Q =\mp 1$, describing the winding of the magnetic orientation. Half-integer winding numbers, $\mathcal Q=\pm \frac{1}{2}$, can be obtained for magnetic vortices (merons). Here, we discuss the physics of magnets with fractional topological charge which is neither integer nor half-integer. We argue that in ferromagnetic films with cubic anisotropy, textures with $\mathcal Q=\pm\frac{1}{6} $ or $\pm\frac{1}{8}$ arise naturally when three or more magnetic domains meet. We also show that a single magnetic skyrmion with $\mathcal Q =-1$ can explode into four fractional defects, each carrying charge $\mathcal Q=-\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we investigate a point defect with a non-quantised fractional charge ($\mathcal Q\neq \frac{n}{m}, n,m\in\mathbb{Z}$) which can move parallel to a magnetic domain wall. Only defects with fractional charge lead to an Aharonov-Bohm effect for magnons. We investigate the resulting forces on a fractional defect due to magnon currents.</description>

      <title>Non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation in split-index matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.</description>

      <title>Variational minimization scheme for the one-particle reduced density matrix functional theory in the ensemble N-representability domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-particle reduced density-matrix (1-RDM) functional theory is a promising alternative to density-functional theory (DFT) that uses the 1-RDM rather than the electronic density as a basic variable. However, long-standing challenges such as the lack of Kohn--Sham scheme and the complexity of the pure $N$-representability conditions are still impeding its wild utilization. Fortunately, ensemble $N$-representability conditions derived in the natural orbital basis are known and trivial, such that almost every functionals of the 1-RDM are actually natural orbital functionals which do not perform well for all the correlation regimes. In this work, we propose a variational minimization scheme in the ensemble $N$-representable domain that is not restricted to the natural orbital representation of the 1-RDM. We show that splitting the minimization into the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the 1-RDM can open the way toward the development of functionals of the orbital occupations, which remains a challenge for the generalization of site-occupation functional theory in chemistry. Our approach is tested on the uniform Hubbard model using the M\"uller and the T\"ows--Pastor functionals, as well as on the dihydrogen molecule using the M\"uller functional.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced renormalization of exchange interactions in metallic two-dimensional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of spin-polarized charge carriers in metallic magnets provides a mechanism for spin-lattice interactions mediated by electron-phonon coupling. Here, we present a theory of this mechanism used to estimate its effect on the exchange interactions in 2D magnets. Starting from a square lattice model at half filling, we show that the presence of electron-phonon coupling with equilibrium phonon distribution leads to a notable suppression of exchange interactions with temperature. We then apply our approach to the prototypical 2D metallic ferromagnet, Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, with moderate electron-phonon coupling. We find that the exchange interactions undergo a renormalization, leading to a softening of the magnon modes, and suppression of the Curie temperature by $\sim$10\%. We expect that this effect can be further enhanced in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling, as well as for non-equilibrium distribution of phonons induced by strong laser fields or charge currents.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Signature of point nodal superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Angle-Resolved Photo-emission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 046402 (2023)] on PdTe, a 3D-Dirac semimetal and a superconductor with the transition temperature Tc ~ 4.3 K, have revealed compelling evidence of the presence of bulk nodes in the superconducting order parameter. To investigate the validity of this proposition, here we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of PdTe down to temperatures ~ 58 mK. We observed that the low temperature specific heat of PdTe with an externally applied magnetic field exhibits a power-law field dependence, a characteristic of unconventional superconductivity. Furthermore, the zero-field low-temperature electronic specific heat follows a cubic temperature dependence, which is a signature of the presence of bulk point nodes in PdTe. These intriguing observations suggest that PdTe is a rare and fascinating topological material that exhibits both Dirac semimetallic properties and superconductivity with point nodal gap symmetry.</description>
