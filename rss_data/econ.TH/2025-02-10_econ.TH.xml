      <title>Impartial utilitarianism on infinite utility streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When evaluating policies that affect future generations, the most commonly used criterion is the discounted utilitarian rule. However, in terms of intergenerational fairness, it is difficult to justify prioritizing the current generation over future generations. This paper axiomatically examines impartial utilitarian rules over infinite-dimensional utility streams. We provide simple characterizations of the social welfare ordering evaluating utility streams by their long-run average in the domain where the average can be defined. Furthermore, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions of the same axioms in a more general domain, the set of bounded streams. Some of these results are closely related to the Banach limits, a well-known generalization of the classical limit concept for streams. Thus, this paper can be seen as proposing an appealing subclass of the Banach limits by the axiomatic analysis.</description>

      <title>Social Choice Rules with Responsibility for Individual Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines normatively acceptable criteria for evaluating social states when individuals are responsible for their skills or productivity and these factors should be accounted for. We consider social choice rules over sets of feasible utility vectors \`a la Nash's (1950) bargaining problem. First, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for choice rules to be rationalized by welfare orderings or functions over ability-normalized utility vectors. These general results provide a foundation for exploring novel choice rules with the normalization and providing their axiomatic foundations. By adding natural axioms, we propose and axiomatize a new class of choice rules, which can be viewed as combinations of three key principles: distribution according to individuals' abilities, utilitarianism, and egalitarianism. Furthermore, we show that at the axiomatic level, this class of choice rules is closely related to the classical bargaining solution introduced by Kalai and Smorodinsky (1975).</description>
