      <title>Experimental Validation of String Oscillation in Subharmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lowest notes produced by string instruments are typically limited by the fundamental vibration of the strings. However, precise control of bow pressure can lead to the production of even lower notes. Despite significant interest in this counterintuitive technique and various proposed explanations, no conclusive evidence has been provided, making detailed discussions of the underlying mechanism challenging. In this study, we employ high-speed imaging to visualize the spatial vibration modes of stringed instruments, confirming Helmholtz motion and its modifications under subharmonic conditions. Finite element simulations further demonstrated that increased bow pressure amplifies frictional forces, suppressing standard vibrations and allowing subharmonic frequencies to emerge. Our results provide the clear experimental validation of the mechanism underlying subharmonic sound production, providing an avenue for further exploration of vibrational and oscillatory phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the locus formed by the maximum heights of an ultra-relativistic projectile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of relativistic projectiles in a uniform gravitational force field in an inertial frame. For the first time, we have found the curve that joins the points of maximum height of all trajectories followed by a projectile in the ultra-relativistic limit. The parametric equations of this curve produce an onion-like curve; in fact, it is one of the loops of a lemniscate-type curve. We also verify that the curve is an ellipse in the nonrelativistic approximation. These two limiting results are obtained by following two slightly distinct approaches. In addition, we calculate the nonrelativistic and ultra-relativistic approximations of the trajectory equation and parametric equations of the trajectory as functions of time. We also find the asymptotic behavior of the ultra-relativistic trajectory equations for points that are very distant from the launching point. All limiting cases in the article are studied in detail. Additionally, we discuss various physical issues related to some of our results. The content of the article is appropriate for advanced undergraduate students.</description>

      <title>Polarizations Underdescribe Vectorial Electromagnetic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves are described by not only polarization ellipses but also cyclically rotating vectors tracing out them. The corresponding fields are respectively directionless steady line fields and directional instantaneous vector fields. Here we study the seminal topic of electromagnetic scattering from the perspective of instantaneous vector fields and uncover how the global topology of the momentum sphere regulates local distributions of tangent scattered fields. Structurally-stable generic singularities of vector fields move cyclically along lines of linear polarizations and at any instant the index sum of all instantaneous singularities has to be the Euler characteristic $\chi=2$. This contrasts sharply with steady line fields, of which generic singularities constrained by the Euler characteristic locate on points of circular polarizations. From such unique perspective of instantaneous singularities, we discovered that for circularly-polarized waves scattered by electromagnetic duality-symmetric particles, since linearly-polarized scatterings are prohibited by helicity conservation, there must exist at least one dark direction along which the scattering is strictly zero. Two such dark directions can be tuned to overlap, along which the scattering would remain zero for arbitrary incident polarizations. We have essentially revealed that \textit{polarizations underdescribe vectorial electromagnetic waves and the instantaneous perspective is indispensable}. The complementarity we discover provides broader and deeper insights into not only electromagnetism, but also other branches of wave physics where singularities are generic and ubiquitous.</description>
