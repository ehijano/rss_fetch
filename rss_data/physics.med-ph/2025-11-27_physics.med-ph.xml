      <title>Strategic Development of a Hydrogen Supply Chain in Corsica: a Multi-criteria Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-objective framework for hydrogen supply chain (HSC) planning is developed for island contexts, incorporating Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) over multiple time periods. The model minimizes total system cost, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and a risk index criteria. The case study of Corsica is considered, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial analysis and infrastructure locating. The 2050 future design of the HSC is determined including site selection, capacity sizing, and technology choices. The proposed m-TOPSIS-based multi objectives solution shows a decentralized infrastructure with a levelized cost of hydrogen of ___6.55/kg, and greenhouse gas emissions under 2 kgCO___e/kg H___. The study also integrates water availability and tourism-induced demand variation as key drivers of energy planning in insular regions.</description>

      <title>Stopping power monitoring during proton therapy by means of prompt gamma timing: first experimental results with a homogeneous phantom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton therapy's full potential is limited by uncertainties that prevent optimal dose distribution. Monitoring techniques can reduce these uncertainties and enable adaptive treatment planning. Spatiotemporal Emission Reconstruction from Prompt-Gamma Timing (SER-PGT) is a promising method that provides insights into both particle range and stopping power, whose calculation would normally require knowledge about patient tissue properties that cannot be directly measured. We present the first experimental results using a 226.9 MeV synchrotron-proton beam impinging on a homogeneous phantom at a sub-clinical intensity (2 - 4 x 10^7 pps). SER-PGT uses data from a multi-detector setup: a thin and segmented Low Gain Avalanche Diode for proton detection and Lanthanum Bromide-based crystals for photon detection. The estimated stopping power profile showed an 8% +- 3% average error compared to NIST PSTAR values, and 2% +- 2% deviation relative to water at 100 MeV. Range assessment in a phantom with a 4 cm air-gap successfully identified the range shift with a 3 mm standard deviation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using SER-PGT to recover both range and stopping power information through particle kinematics and PGT measurements.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Anti-Equinus Orthosis with Electromyography Sensor for Neuromuscular Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equinus foot is a neuromuscular condition that affects ankle dorsiflexion, impairing gait and reducing quality of life. This study presents EquiSay, a dynamic anti-equinus orthosis equipped with an anterior elastic tension system and an electromyography (EMG) sensor to quantify muscle activation, particularly of the tibialis anterior. EquiSay provides dynamic support that improves foot posture and natural movement while enabling real-time neuromuscular monitoring.
  To address the limited availability of EMG data, the system incorporates a U-Net based model for generating synthetic EMG signals and a predictive framework for automatic calibration of minimum activation thresholds. Experimental results show improved dorsiflexion, increased patient satisfaction, and valuable clinical insights for rehabilitation planning. These findings highlight the potential of EquiSay as an assistive tool and as a platform for future AI-enhanced developments.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy via Projection-based Processing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) enables comprehensive visualization of the vasculature, thereby improving diagnostic reliability. Nevertheless, its clinical translation remains challenging, as the exponential growth in voxel count for full 3D reconstruction imposes heavy computational demands and extensive post-processing time. In this row-column array (RCA)-based 3D in vivo pig kidney ULM study, we reformulate each step of the full 3D ULM pipeline, including beamforming, clutter filtering, motion estimation, microbubble separation and localization into a series of computational-efficient 2D operations, substantially reducing the number of voxels to be processed while maintaining comparable accuracy. The proposed framework reconstructs each 0.75-s ensemble acquired at frame rate of 400 Hz, covering a 25*27.4*27.4 mm3 volume, in 0.52 s (70% of the acquisition time) on a single RTX A6000 Ada GPU, while maintaining ULM image quality comparable to conventional 3D processing. Quantitatively, it achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.93 between density maps and a voxel-wise velocity agreement with slope of 0.93 and R2 = 0.88, closely matching conventional 3D results, and for the first time, demonstrating potential for real-time feedback during scanning, which could improve robustness, reduce operator dependence and accelerate clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>A Brief History of Digital Twin Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Timing Behavior of Compton Scattering in BGO for Time-of-Flight PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bismuth germanate (BGO) is gaining renewed attention as a viable material for hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) detectors. While single-crystal studies have demonstrated excellent timing resolution by leveraging prompt Cherenkov photons, practical detector modules based on pixelated arrays introduce a high prevalence of inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events, complicating timing accuracy. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of InterCS on BGO Cherenkov timing using a dual-pixel detector coupled to a segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified into full-energy deposition (FED; primary crystal 511 keV absorption), InterCS, and penetration types via energy-weighted positioning and validated using GATE simulations, which also revealed that over 25% of the experimentally identified full-energy events involved intra-crystal scatter (IntraCS). For InterCS events, the optimal timestamp selection was achieved by choosing the earlier of the two timestamps, yielding a coincidence timing resolution of 221 ps FWHM (831 ps FWTM)-markedly worse than the 184 ps (603 ps FWTM) obtained for FED events. Furthermore, prompt photon yield was found to decrease measurably due to energy splitting: InterCS events averaged 4.73 detected photons in the first 1 ns, compared to 5.76 for FED events. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating time-aware, per-pixel timestamping strategies in pixelated BGO TOF-PET systems to maintain optimal timing performance in the presence of scatter.</description>

      <title>Investigating time- and orientation-dependent transverse relaxation from magnetic susceptibility of white matter microstructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse relaxation in MRI is modulated by magnetic field variations arising from tissue microstructure, offering a potential window into the underlying chemical composition and structural organization at the cellular scale. However, the transverse relaxation rate in white matter depends on both echo time and the orientation of axons relative to the external field. Such anisotropy complicates the interpretation of transverse relaxation in general and as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease. Understanding this anisotropy is therefore crucial for accurately analyzing MRI signals. While previous modeling studies have investigated these effects, they often relied on simplified or idealized tissue geometries. In this study, we investigate magnetic field variance and intra-axonal transverse relaxation using realistic axonal microstructure extracted from 3D electron microscopy, incorporating myelinated axons with embedded spherical susceptibility sources. We derive how transverse relaxation depends on the angle between axons and the external magnetic field. Simulations show that the time-dependent power-law signature arising from white matter structural disorder is weak and may be difficult to detect at currently achievable noise levels, echo times, and field strengths. This is because the power-law curvature over a typical range of echo times deviates only slightly from a linear trend. Our findings highlight the influence of axonal geometry on intra-axonal transverse relaxation and suggest that accounting for both time and orientation dependence may facilitate the development of more precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural, or social - are composed of units - such as stocks, neurons, or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationship between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series shares a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average, while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not, and, if so, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, with the major contribution to the underlying negative subgraph coming from the subcortical structures (and, to a lesser extent, from the limbic regions). At the mesoscopic level, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion, instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model, reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>
