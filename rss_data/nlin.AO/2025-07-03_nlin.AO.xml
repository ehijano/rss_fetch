      <title>Effect of phase-lag on synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transition to synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions both analytically and numerically in the presence of phase frustration ($\beta$). The higher order topology consists of pairwise and triadic couplings. The analytical framework for the investigation is based on the Ott-Antonsen ansatz which leads to a convenient low-dimensional model. Extensive bifurcation analysis of the low-dimensional model and the numerical simulation of the full networks are performed to explore the paths to synchronization. The combined analysis shows a complex dependence of the transition to synchronization on adaptation exponents, coupling strengths, phase lag parameter, and multilayer configuration. Various types of transitions to synchronization, namely continuous, tiered, and explosive, are exhibited by the system in different regions of the parameter space. In all the cases, a satisfactory match between the low-dimensional model and the numerical simulation results is observed. The origin of different transitions to synchronization is clearly understood using the low-dimensional model. Exploration of a wide region of the parameter space suggests that the phase frustration parameter inhibits tired as well as explosive synchronization transitions for fixed triadic coupling strength ($K_2$). On the other hand, discontinuous transition is promoted by the phase frustration parameter for fixed pairwise coupling strength ($K_1$). Moreover, the exponent of the adaptation function with the pairwise coupling decreases the width of the hysteresis, despite the dominance of the higher-order coupling for fixed $\beta$ and $K_2$. While, the exponent of the function adapted with higher-order coupling shows the opposite effect, it promotes bistability in spite of dominance of pairwise coupling strength for fixed $\beta$, and $K_1$.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Monty Hall Decision Problem with Reaction Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Monty Hall probability problem as a model system, we ask whether simple chemical reaction mechanisms can implement optimal strategies for non-trivial decision making. In this puzzle, a contestant chooses one of three doors (only one hides a prize), the host, knowing the content, opens another door revealing no prize, and finally the contestant must decide whether to stay with the original choice or switch to the remaining closed door. Assigning distinct molecular species to the player, initial choice, reveal step, and final decision, we encode the problem in mass-action kinetics. For pseudo-first-order conditions, tuning a single rate constant shifts the network continuously between "always-stay" (1/3 success) and "always-switch" (2/3 success) regimes. We derive closed-form, time-dependent expressions for the success kinetics, concluding with a brief discussion of proposed DNA strand-displacement implementations and kinetically hard-wired molecular decision-making.</description>
