      <title>Geometric Optimization of the First Robin Eigenvalue in Exterior Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the geometric optimization problem of the first Robin eigenvalue in exterior domains, specifically the lowest point of the spectrum of the Laplace operator under Robin boundary conditions in the complement of a bounded domain. In contrast to the Laplace operator on bounded domains, the spectrum of this operator is not purely discrete. The discrete nature of the first eigenvalue depends on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. In two dimensions, D. Krejcirik and V. Lotoreichik show that the ball maximizes the first Robin eigenvalue among all smooth, bounded, simply connected sets with given perimeter or given area, provided the eigenvalue is discrete.
  We extend these findings to higher dimensions. The discrete spectrum of the Laplace operator under Robin boundary conditions can be characterized through the Steklov eigenvalue problem in exterior domains, a topic studied by G. Auchmuty and Q. Han. Assuming that the lowest point of the spectrum is a discrete eigenvalue, we show that the ball is a local maximizer among nearly spherical domains with prescribed measure. However, in general, the ball does not emerge as the global maximizer for the first Robin eigenvalue under either prescribed measure or prescribed perimeter.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Domains for Scalar Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a scalar conservation law with strictly convex flux, by Oleinik's estimates the total variation of a solution with initial data $\overline{u}\in \bf{L}^\infty(\mathbb R)$ decays like $t^{-1}$. This paper introduces a class of intermediate domains $\mathcal P_\alpha$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, such that for $\overline u\in \mathcal P_\alpha$ a faster decay rate is achieved: $\mathrm{Tot.Var.}\bigl\{ u(t,\cdot)\bigr\}\sim t^{\alpha-1}$. A key ingredient of the analysis is a ``Fourier-type" decomposition of $\overline u$ into components which oscillate more and more rapidly. The results aim at extending the theory of fractional domains for analytic semigroups to an entirely nonlinear setting.</description>

      <title>Viscous shock waves of Burgers equation with fast diffusion and singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic stability of viscous shock waves for Burgers' equation with fast diffusion $u_t+f(u)_x=\mu (u^m)_{xx}$ on $\mathbb{R} \times (0, +\infty)$ when $0&lt;m&lt;1$. For the proposed constant states $u_-&gt;u_+=0$, the equation with fast diffusion $(u^m)_{xx}=m\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}}\right)_x$ processes a strong singularity at $u_+=0$, which causes the stability study to be challenging. We observe that, there exist two different types of viscous shocks, one is the non-degenerate shock satisfying Lax's entropy condition with fast algebraic decay to the singular state $u_+=0$, which causes much strong singularity to the system in the form of $m\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}}\right)_x$, and the other is the degenerate viscous shocks with slow algebraic decay to $u_+=0$, which makes less strong singularity to the system. In order to overcome the singularity at $u_+=0$, we technically use the weighted energy method and develop a new strategy where the weights related to the shock waves are carefully selected, while the chosen weights for the non-degenerate case are stronger than the degenerate case. Numerical simulations are also carried out in different cases to illustrate and validate our theoretical results. In particular, we numerically approximate the solution for different value of $0&lt;m&lt;1$, and find that the shapes of shock waves become steeper when the singularity $\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}}\right)_x$ is stronger as $m\rightarrow 0$, which indicates that the effect of singular fast diffusion on the solution is essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the viscosity solutions theory for integro-differential equations to the \emph{one-phase} Muskat equation (also known as the Hele-Shaw problem with gravity). We prove global well-posedness for the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann equation with bounded, uniformly continuous initial data, in all dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that semilinear parabolic evolution equations $u'=A+f(t,u)$ featuring H\"older continuous nonlinearities $ f=f(t,u)$ with at most linear growth possess global strong solutions for a general class of initial data. The abstract results are applied to a recent model describing front propagation in bushfires and in the context of a reaction-diffusion system.</description>

      <title>Some nonlinear problems for the superposition of fractional operators with Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the existence theory of a nonlinear problem of nonlocal type subject to Neumann boundary conditions. Differently from the existing literature, the elliptic operator under consideration is obtained as a superposition of operators of mixed order.
  The setting that we introduce is very general and comprises, for instance, the sum of two fractional Laplacians, or of a fractional Laplacian and a Laplacian, as particular cases (the situation in which there are infinitely many operators, and even a continuous distribution of operators, can be considered as well).
  New bits of functional analysis are introduced to deal with this problem. An eigenvalue analysis divides the existence theory into two streams, one related to a Mountain Pass method, the other to a Linking technique.</description>

      <title>Co-existence of Type II blow-ups with multiple blow-up rates for five-dimensional heat equation with critical nonlinear boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following five-dimensional heat equation with critical boundary condition \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u=\Delta u
  \mbox{ \ in \ } \mathbb{R}_+^5\times (0,T) ,
  \quad
  -\partial_{x_5}u =|u|^\frac{2}{3}u \mbox{ \ on \ } \pp \mathbb{R}^5_+ \times (0,T) . \end{equation*} Given $\mathfrak{o}$ distinct boundary points $q^{[i]} \in \partial \mathbb{R}_+^5$, and $\mathfrak{o}$ integers $l_i\in \mathbb{N}$ (possibly duplicated), $i=1,2,\dots, \mathfrak{o}$, for $T&gt;0$ sufficiently small, we construct a finite-time blow-up solution $u$ with a type II blow-up rate $(T-t)^{-3l_i -3}$ for $x$ near $q^{[i]}$. This seems to be the first result of the co-existence of type II blowups with different blow-up rates. To accommodate highly unstable blowups with different blowup rates, we first develop a unified linear theory for the inner problem with more time decay in the blow-up scheme through restriction on the spatial growth of the right-hand side, and then use vanishing adjustment functions for deriving multiple rates at distinct points. This paper is inspired by [25, 52, 60].</description>

      <title>Uniform Regularity for Incompressible MHD Equations in a Bounded Domain with Curved Boundary in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the initial boundary problem of the incompressible MHD equations in a bounded domain with general curved boundary in 3D with the general Navier-slip boundary conditions for the velocity field and the perfect conducting condition for the magnetic field, we establish the uniform regularity of conormal Sobolev norms and Lipschitz norms to addressing the anisotropic regularity of tangential and normal directions, which enable us to prove the vanishing dissipation limit as the viscosity and the magnetic diffusion coefficients tend to zero. We overcome the difficulties caused by the intricate interaction of boundary curvature, velocity field, and magnetic fields and resolve the issue caused by the problem that the viscosity and the magnetic diffusion coefficients are not required to be equal.</description>

      <title>Two Positive Normalized Solutions on Star-shaped Bounded Domains to the Br\'ezis-Nirenberg Problem, I: Existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new framework to prove the existence of two positive solutions with prescribed mass on star-shaped bounded domains: one is the normalized ground state and another is of M-P type. We merely address the Sobolev critical cases since the Sobolev subcritical ones can be addressed by following similar arguments and are easier. Our framework is based on some important observations, that, to the best of our knowledge, have not appeared in previous literatures. Using these observations, we firstly establish the existence of a normalized ground state solution, whose existence is unknown so for. Then we use some novel ideas to obtain the second positive normalized solution, which is of M-P type. It seems to be the first time in the literatures to get two positive solutions under our settings, even in the Sobolev subcritical cases. We further remark that our framework is applicable to many other equations.</description>

      <title>A first order in time wave equation modeling nonlinear acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on a small amplitude approximation of a Navier-Stokes-Fourier system modeling nonlinear acoustics. Omitting all third and higher order terms with respect to certain small parameters, we obtain a first order in time system containing linear and quadratic pressure and velocity terms.
  Subsequently, the well-posedness of the derived system is shown using the classical method of Galerkin approximation in combination with a fixed point argument. We first prove the well-posedness of a linearized equation using energy estimates and then the well-posedness of the nonlinear system using a Newton-Kantorovich type argument. Based on this, we also obtain global in time well-posedness for small enough data and exponential decay. This is in line with semigroup results for a linear part of the system that we provide as well.</description>

      <title>Travelling waves in a minimal go-or-grow model of cell invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a minimal go-or-grow model of cell invasion, whereby cells can either proliferate, following logistic growth, or move, via linear diffusion, and phenotypic switching between these two states is density-dependent. Formal analysis in the fast switching regime shows that the total cell density in the two-population go-or-grow model can be described in terms of a single reaction-diffusion equation with density-dependent diffusion and proliferation. Using the connection to single-population models, we study travelling wave solutions, showing that the wave speed in the go-or-grow model is always bounded by the wave speed corresponding to the well-known Fisher-KPP equation.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet problems associated to abstract nonlocal space-time differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let the abstract fractional space--time operator $(\partial_t + A)^s$ be given, where $s \in (0,\infty)$ and $-A \colon \mathsf{D}(A) \subseteq X \to X$ is a linear operator generating a uniformly bounded strongly measurable semigroup $(S(t))_{t\ge0}$ on a complex Banach space $X$. We consider the corresponding Dirichlet problem of finding a function $u \colon \mathbb{R} \to X$ such that $(\partial_t + A)^s u(t) = 0$ on $(t_0, \infty)$ and $u(t) = g(t)$ on $(-\infty, t_0]$, for given $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $g \colon (-\infty,t_0] \to X$. We derive a solution formula which expresses $u$ in terms of $g$ and $(S(t))_{t\ge0}$ and generalizes the well-known variation of constants formula for the mild solution to the abstract Cauchy problem $u' + Au = 0$ on $(t_0, \infty)$ with $u(t_0) = x \in \overline{\mathsf{D}(A)}$. Moreover, we include a comparison to analogous solution concepts arising from Riemann-Liouville and Caputo type initial value problems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability and transition threshold for the planar helical flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonlinear stability for the planar helical flow at high Reynolds number $Re$. We prove that if the initial velocity satisfies $$ \left\|U_0-(\delta^2\sin(m_0 y),\delta^2\cos(m_0 y),0)\right\|_{X_0}\leq c_0 Re^{-7/4} $$ for some $c_0&gt;0$ independent of $Re$, then the solution of 3-D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is global in time and does not transit away from the planar helical flow. Here $\delta&gt;1, m_0=\delta^{-1}$ and the norm $\|\cdot\|_{X_0}$ is defined in \eqref{eq:1.8}. This is a nonlinear stability result for 3-D non-shear flow and the transition threshold is less than $7/4$.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for addressing the singularly perturbed nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation:
  \begin{equation}
  -\varepsilon^2\Delta v + V(x) v =f(v),\ v&gt;0,\ \lim_{|x|\to \infty} v(x)=0,
  \end{equation}
where $V$ possesses a local maximum point and $f$ satisfies the Berestycki-Lions conditions.The key to our approach is the derivation of a refined lower bound on the gradient norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Dirichlet problem for elliptic systems with periodically distributed inclusions whose conduction parameter exhibits a significant contrast compared to the background media. We develop a unified method to quantify the convergence rates both as the periodicity of inclusions tends to zero and as the parameter approaches either zero or infinity. Based on the obtained convergence rates and a Campanato-type scheme, we also derive the regularity estimates that are uniform both in the periodicity and the contrast.</description>

      <title>Wave-front tracking for a quasi-linear scalar conservation law with hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we deal with the Cauchy problem for the quasi-linear scalar conservation law \[u_t+ {\cal F}(u)_t+u_x=0,\] where ${\cal F}$ is a specific hysteresis operator, namely the Play operator. Hysteresis models a rate-independent memory relationship between the input $u$ and its output. Its presence in the partial differential equation gives a particular non-local feature to the latter allowing us to capture phenomena that may arise in some application fields. Riemann problems and the interactions between shock lines are studied and via the so-called Wave-Front Tracking method a solution to the Cauchy problem with bounded variation initial data is constructed. The solution found satisfies an entropy-like condition, making it the unique solution in the class of entropy admissible ones.</description>

      <title>On an inhomogeneous coagulation model with a differential sedimentation kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inhomogeneous coagulation equation that contains a transport term in the spatial variable modeling the sedimentation of clusters. We prove local existence of mass conserving solutions for a class of coagulation kernels for which in the space homogeneous case instantaneous gelation (i.e., instantaneous loss of mass) occurs. Our result holds true in particular for sum-type kernels of homogeneity greater than one, for which solutions do not exist at all in the spatially homogeneous case. Moreover, our result covers kernels that in addition vanish on the diagonal, which have been used to describe the onset of rain and the behavior of air bubbles in water.</description>

      <title>On the non-local problem for Boussinesq type fractional equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the Boussinesq type fractional partial differential equation has attracted much attentions of researchers for its practical importance. In this paper we study a non-local problem for the Boussinesq type equation $D_t^\alpha u(t)+A D_t^\alpha u(t)+\nu^2A u(t)=0,\,\, 0&lt; t&lt; T,\,\, 1&lt;\alpha&lt;2,$ where $D_t^\alpha$ is the Caputo fractional derivative and $A$ is abstract operator. In the classical case, i.e. at $\alpha=2$, this problem was studied earlier and an interesting effect was discovered: the well-posedness of the problem significantly depends on the length of the time interval and the parameter $\nu$. This note shows that for the case of a fractional equation there is no such effect: the problem is well-posed for any $T$ and $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Constructing heat kernels on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, edge- and vertex-weighted graph with certain reasonable restrictions. We construct the heat kernel of the associated Laplacian using an adaptation of the parametrix approach due to Minakshisundaram-Pleijel in the setting of Riemannian geometry. This is partly motivated by the wish to relate the heat kernels of a graph and a subgraph, or of a domain and a discretization of it. As an application, assuming that the graph is locally finite, we express the heat kernel $H_G(x,y;t)$ as a Taylor series with the lead term being $a(x,y)t^r$, where $r$ is the combinatorial distance between $x$ and $y$ and $a(x,y)$ depends (explicitly) upon edge and vertex weights. In the case $G$ is the regular $(q+1)$-tree with $q\geq 1$, our construction reproves different explicit formulas due to Chung-Yau and to Chinta-Jorgenson-Karlsson. Assuming uniform boundedness of the combinatorial vertex degree, we show that a dilated Gaussian depending on any distance metric on $G$, which is uniformly bounded from below can be taken as a parametrix in our construction. Our work extends in part the recent articles [LNY21, CJKS23] in that the graphs are infinite and weighted.</description>

      <title>A numerical view on {\alpha}-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha$ belongs to $W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$. The method combines a projection operator with a generalized method of characteristics and an iteration scheme, which is based on enforcing minimal time steps whenever breaking times cluster. Numerical examples illustrate that these minimal time steps increase the efficiency of the algorithm substantially. Moreover, convergence of the wave profile is shown in $C([0, T], L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}))$ for any finite $T \geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Metric Sobolev spaces I: equivalence of definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of two works concerning the Sobolev calculus on metric measure spaces and its applications. In this work, we focus on several notions of metric Sobolev space and on their equivalence. More precisely, we give a systematic presentation of first-order $p$-Sobolev spaces, with $p\in[1,\infty)$, defined over a complete and separable metric space equipped with a boundedly-finite Borel measure. We focus on three different approaches: via approximation with Lipschitz functions; by studying the behaviour along curves, in terms either of the curve modulus or of test plans; via integration-by-parts, using Lipschitz derivations with divergence. Eventually, we show that all these approaches are fully equivalent. We emphasise that no doubling or Poincar\'{e} assumption is made, and that we allow also for the exponent $p=1$.
  A substantial part of this work consists of a self-contained and partially-revisited exposition of known results, which are scattered across the existing literature, but it contains also several new results, mostly concerning the equivalence of metric Sobolev spaces for $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous compensation of input delay and state/input quantization for linear systems via switched predictor feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a switched predictor-feedback law, which achieves global asymptotic stabilization of linear systems with input delay and with the plant and actuator states available only in (almost) quantized form. The control design relies on a quantized version of the nominal predictor-feedback law for linear systems, in which quantized measurements of the plant and actuator states enter the predictor state formula. A switching strategy is constructed to dynamically adjust the tunable parameter of the quantizer (in a piecewise constant manner), in order to initially increase the range and subsequently decrease the error of the quantizers. The key element in the proof of global asymptotic stability in the supremum norm of the actuator state is derivation of solutions' estimates combining a backstepping transformation with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments, for addressing the error due to quantization. We extend this result to the input quantization case and illustrate our theory with a numerical example.</description>

Abstract: We first define the trace on a domain $\Omega$ which is definable in an o-minimal structure. We then show that every function $u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ vanishing on the boundary in the trace sense satisfies Poincar\'e inequality. We finally show, given a definable family of domains $(\Omega_t)_{t\in \mathbb{R}^k}$, that the constant of this inequality remains bounded, if so does the volume of $\Omega_t$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative derivation of a two-phase porous media system from the one-velocity Baer-Nunziato and Kapila systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate two types of relaxation processes quantitatively in the context of small data global-in-time solutions for compressible one-velocity multi-fluid models. First, we justify the pressure-relaxation limit from a one-velocity Baer-Nunziato system to a Kapila model as the pressure-relaxation parameter tends to zero, in a uniform manner with respect to the time-relaxation parameter associated to the friction forces modeled in the equation of the velocity. This uniformity allows us to further consider the time-relaxation limit for the Kapila model. More precisely, we show that the diffusely time-rescaled solution of the Kapila system converges to the solution of a two-phase porous media type system as the time-relaxation parameter tends to zero. For both relaxation limits, we exhibit explicit convergence rates.     Our proof of existence results are based on an elaborate low-frequency and high-frequency analysis via the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and it includes three main ingredients: a refined spectral analysis for the linearized problem to determine the threshold of frequencies explicitly in terms of the time-relaxation parameter, the introduction of an effective flux in the low-frequency region to overcome the loss of parameters due to the overdamping phenomenon, and the renormalized energy estimates in the high-frequency region to cancel higher-order nonlinear terms. To show the convergence rates, we discover several auxiliary unknowns that reveal better structures. In conclusion, our approach may be applied to a class of non-symmetric partially dissipative hyperbolic system with rough coefficients which do not have any time-integrability, in the context of overdamping phenomenon. It extends the latest results of Danchin and the first author [15, 16].</description>

Abstract: Huisken's problem asks whether there is an elastic flow of closed planar curves that is initially contained in the upper half-plane but `migrates' to the lower half-plane at a positive time. Here we consider variants of Huisken's problem for open curves under the natural boundary condition, and construct various migrating elastic flows both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly Elastic Maps: Energy Minimizing Configurations of Membranes on Prescribed Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for nonlinearly elastic membranes undergoing finite deformations while confined to a regular frictionless surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a physically correct model of the analogy sometimes given to motivate harmonic maps between manifolds. The proposed stored-energy function is convex in the strain pair comprising the deformation gradient and the local area ratio. If the target surface is a plane, the problem reduces to 2-dimensional, polyconvex nonlinear elasticity addressed by J.M. Ball. On the other hand, the energy density is not rank-one convex for unconstrained deformations into $\mathbb{R}^3$. Nonetheless, we show that the problem admits an energy-minimizing configuration when constrained to lie on the given surface. For a class of Dirichlet problems, we demonstrate that the minimizing deformation is a homeomorphism onto its image on the given surface and establish the weak Eulerian form of the equilibrium equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the global-in-time $ L^2 $-solvability of the initial-boundary value problem for differential inclusions of doubly-nonlinear type, which arises from fracture mechanics, is proved. This problem is not covered by general existence theories due to the degeneracy and singularity of a dissipation potential along with the nonlinearity of elliptic terms. The existence of solutions is proved based on a minimizing movement scheme, which also plays a crucial role for deriving qualitative and asymptotic properties of strong solutions. Moreover, the solutions to the initial-boundary value problem comply with three properties intrinsic to brittle fracture: complete irreversibility, unilateral equilibrium of an energy and an energy balance law, which cannot generally be realized in dissipative systems. Furthermore, long-time dynamics of strong solutions is also treated, i.e., stationary limits of the global-in-time solutions are characterized as a solution to the stationary problem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov system in $\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}^3$, where the initial fluid density is allowed to vanish. We establish the uniform bound of the macroscopic density associated with the distribution function and prove the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the Cauchy problem with vacuum for either small initial energy or large viscosity coefficient. The uniform boundedness and the presence of vacuum enable us to show that as the time evolves, the fluid velocity decays, while the distribution function concentrates towards a Dirac measure in velocity centred at $0$, with an exponential rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work revisits a recent finding by the first author concerning the local convergence of a regularized scalar conservation law. We significantly improve the original statement by establishing a global convergence result within the Lebesgue spaces $L^\infty_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^+;L^p(\mathbb{R}))$, for any $p \in [1,\infty)$, as the regularization parameter $\ell$ approaches zero. Notably, we demonstrate that this stability result is accompanied by a quantifiable rate of convergence. A key insight in our proof lies in the observation that the fluctuations of the solutions remain under control in low regularity spaces, allowing for a potential quantification of their behavior in the limit as $\ell\to 0$. This is achieved through a careful asymptotic analysis of the perturbative terms in the regularized equation, which, in our view, constitutes a pivotal contribution to the core findings of this paper.</description>

Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for fractional (and non-fractional) nonlinear diffusion equations posed in bounded domains. Main results consist of well-posedness in an energy class with no sign restriction and convergence of such (possibly sign-changing) energy solutions to asymptotic profiles after a proper rescaling. They will be proved in a variational scheme only, without any use of semigroup theories nor classical quasilinear parabolic theories. Proofs are self-contained and performed in a totally unified fashion for both fractional and non-fractional cases as well as for both porous medium and fast diffusion cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in queueing theory, we consider a stochastic control problem whose state space is the $d$-dimensional positive orthant. The controlled process $Z$ evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance matrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the orthant's boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector $\theta(t)$ at each time $t$ based on the history of $Z$, and the cost rate at time $t$ depends on both $Z(t)$ and $\theta(t)$. In our initial problem formulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an infinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic control problem. Extending earlier work by Han et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2018, 8505-8510), we develop and illustrate a simulation-based computational method that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. For test problems studied thus far, our method is accurate to within a fraction of one percent, and is computationally feasible in dimensions up to at least $d=30$.</description>

While the leading, order $N$, contribution to $E_N$ has been known since [30,28] and the second order corrections (of order one) have been first determined in [5], our estimate also resolves the next term in the asymptotic expansion of $E_N$, which is of the order $(\log N) / N$.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the self-adjointness in $L^2$-setting of the operators acting as $-\nabla\cdot h\nabla$, with piecewise constant functions $h$ having a jump along a Lipschitz hypersurface $\Sigma$, without explicit assumptions on the sign of $h$. We establish a number of sufficient conditions for the self-adjointness of the operator with $H^s$-regularity for suitable $s\in[1,\frac{3}{2}]$, in terms of the jump value and the regularity and geometric properties of $\Sigma$. An important intermediate step is a link with Fredholm properties of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator on $\Sigma$, which is new for the Lipschitz setting.</description>

Abstract: We study a two-dimensional Pauli operator describing a charged quantum particle with spin $1/2$ moving on a plane in presence of an orthogonal Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux. We classify all the admissible self-adjont realizations and give a complete picture of their spectral and scattering properties. Symmetries of the resulting Hamiltonians are also discussed, as well as their connection with the Dirac operator perturbed by an Aharonov-Bohm singularity.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a computational framework to investigate and predict the complicated multiphase properties of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for sustainable technological progress. Although their electromechanical properties vary by phase, lead-free piezoelectric materials show a considerable thermo-electromechanical response. Lead-free materials such as Bi$_{0.5}$Na$_{0,5}$TiO$_{3}$ (BNT) and other BNT-type piezoelectric materials transition to rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases with temperature variation. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Multiple phases can occur simultaneously under specific thermal, electrical, and mechanical conditions, leading in complex multiphase behaviour. These materials' performance must be assessed by studying such behaviour. This study uses Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to simulate material micro-domain phase transitions. The computational model for BNT-type piezoelectric material covers temperature-induced ferroelectric domain switching and phase transitions. Therefore, the developed computational approach will assist us in better understanding the influence of these materials' complex multiphase behaviour on creating sustainable solutions with green technologies.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

      <title>Incremental data compression for PDE-constrained optimization with a data assimilation application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes an inexact gradient method based on incremental proper orthogonal decomposition (iPOD) to address the data storage difficulty in time-dependent PDE-constrained optimization, particularly for a data assimilation problem as a detailed demonstration for the key ideas. The proposed method is proved robust by rigorous analysis. We first derive a sharp data compression error estimate of the iPOD with the help of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. Then we demonstrate a numerical PDE analysis to show how to properly choose Hilbert space for the iPOD data compression so that the gradient error is under control. We further prove that for a convex problem with appropriately bounded gradient error, the inexact gradient method achieves the accuracy level of the optimal solution while not hurting the convergence rate compared with the usual gradient method. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results and validate the proposed method.</description>
