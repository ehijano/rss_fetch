      <title>Three-Dimensional Orbital Architectures and Detectability of Adjacent Companions to Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital properties of the (as-yet) small population of hot Jupiters with nearby planetary companions provide valuable constraints on the past migration processes of these systems. In this work, we explore the likelihood that dynamical perturbations could cause nearby inner or outer companions to hot Jupiter to leave the transiting plane, potentially leaving these companions undetected despite their presence at formation. Using a combination of analytical and numerical models, we examine the effects of stellar evolution on hot Jupiter systems with nearby companions and identify several possible outcomes. We find that while inner companions are generally unlikely to leave the transiting plane, outer companions are more prone to decoupling from the hot Jupiter and becoming non-transiting, depending on the system's initial orbital architecture. Additionally, we observe a range of dynamical behaviors, including overall stability, inclination excitation, and, in some cases, instability leading to the ejection or collision of planets. We also show that the effect of stellar obliquity (with respect to the mean planet of the planets) is to amplify these effects and potentially cause outer companions to attain non-mutually-transiting configurations more often. Our results highlight the complex dynamical pathways shaping the architectures of hot Jupiter systems.</description>

      <title>Water Production Rates from SOHO/SWAN Observations of Comets C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) and C/2022 E3 (ZTF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022 and 2023 the hydrogen comae of two long period comets, C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) and C/2022 E3 (ZTF), were observed with the Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) all-sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha camera on the SOlar and Heliosphere Observer (SOHO) satellite. SWAN obtains nearly daily full-sky images of the hydrogen Lyman-alpha distribution of the interstellar hydrogen as it passes through the solar system yielding information about the solar wind and solar ultraviolet fluxes that eat away at it by ionization and charge exchange. The hydrogen comae of comets, when of sufficient brightness, are also observed. Water production rates have been calculated over time for each of these comets, covering about 6 months mostly of the post-perihelion period of C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) and about 3 months around perihelion of C/2022 E3 (ZTF).</description>

      <title>HST/WFC3 Constraints on the Abundances of OH and FeH in the Atmosphere of the Ultra-Hot Neptune LTT-9779 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets residing within the hot-Neptune Desert are rare, and studying their atmospheres can provide valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary processes. We present the atmospheric characterization of the first known ultra-hot Neptune, LTT-9779 b, using transmission spectroscopic observations obtained with the HST/WFC3 G141 and G102 grisms. Using the Iraclis pipeline and TauREx3 retrieval code, we find that LTT-9779 b likely possesses a H/He-dominated primary atmosphere with an opaque aerosol layer and the pure cloudy, flat-line model is rejected with approximately 2.7-$\sigma$ confidence. Although we do not find conclusive evidence supporting the presence of any molecular species, we place 95% confidence level upper limits on the volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of hydroxyl radical (OH) and iron hydride (FeH) at $7.18\times10^{-2}$ and $1.52\times10^{-8}$, respectively. Notably, the retrieval results are inconsistent with predictions from equilibrium chemistry models, which favor higher $\rm H_2O$ abundances over OH. This discrepancy suggests that disequilibrium processes, such as photochemistry or vertical mixing, may have altered the atmospheric composition. Comparisons between HST, Spitzer and JWST data reveal no evidence of temporal variations in the atmospheric composition of the terminator region. Our results highlight the need for higher-resolution spectroscopy and secondary eclipse observations to resolve LTT-9779 b's temperature-pressure (T-P) profile and chemical inventory definitively.</description>

      <title>Global flow regimes of hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, stellar irradiation is a primary driver of atmospheric circulation and the wave structures that sustain it. We aim to investigate how variations in radiative and dynamical timescales influence global flow regimes, atmospheric circulation efficiency, and the interplay of wave structures across a sample of hot Jupiters. In particular, we explore a previously predicted transition in the global flow regime, where enhanced stellar irradiation suppresses the smaller-scale wave and eddy features that feed into superrotating jets and ultimately leads to simpler, day-to-night dominated flows. We simulate a suite of eight well-studied hot Jupiters with the THOR general circulation model, spanning equilibrium temperatures from about $1100$ K to $2400$ K. We develop a wavelet-based analysis method to decompose simulated wind fields into their underlying wave modes, which we validate on analytical examples. As a preliminary exploration of the flow regime of ultra-hot Jupiters, we perform an additional simulation for WASP-121b, where the mean molecular weight is set to represent an atmosphere dominated by atomic hydrogen. Our results confirm that increasing stellar irradiation diminishes atmospheric heat redistribution efficiency and weakens contributions from smaller-scale modes that are critical to sustain superrotation. As equilibrium temperatures rise, large-scale modes dominate the atmospheric circulation, driving a transition from jet-dominated flows toward day-to-night circulation. Additionally, by artificially lowering the mean molecular weight, we partially restore circulation efficiency and reintroduce a more complex, multi-scale flow pattern. These findings refine our understanding of how atmospheric circulation evolves with increasing irradiation and composition changes, offering a more nuanced framework for interpreting hot and ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Dynamical regimes of two eccentric and mutually inclined giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a basic planetary system composed by a Sun like star, a Jupiter-like planet an a Neptune-like planet in a wide range of orbital configurations not limited to the hierarchical case. We present atlases of resonances showing the domains of approx. 1300 mutual mean-motion resonances (MMRs) and their link to chaotic and regular dynamics. Following a semi-analytical method for the study of the secular dynamics we found two regimes for equilibrium configurations: one for low mutual inclinations were equilibrium is related to oscillations of the difference between the pericenter longitudes around 0 or 180 degrees, and another for high mutual inclinations where the equilibrium is given by defined values of the argument of the pericenters equal to integer multiples of 90 degrees. By numerical integration of the full equations of motion we calculate the fundamental frequencies of the systems in their diverse configurations and study their dependence with the orbital elements. According to the analysis of the fundamental frequencies we found two dynamical regimes depending on the initial mutual inclination and the limit between the two regimes occurs at some critical inclination 30&lt;ic&lt;40 defined by the occurrence of the secular resonance g1=g2. For i&lt;ic the dynamics is analogue a the classic secular model for low (e,i) with well defined three fundamental frequencies and free and forced modes, conserving quasi constant the mutual inclination. For i&gt;ic the dynamics is completely different with increasing changes in mutual inclination and emerging combinations of the fundamental frequencies and, depending on the case, dominated by the secular resonance or the vZLK mechanism.</description>

      <title>Modelling helium in exoplanet atmospheres. A revised network with photoelectron-driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The He I line at 1.08 $\mu$m is a valuable tracer of atmospheric escape in exoplanet atmospheres. We expand past networks used to predict the absorbing He(2$^3S$) by including, firstly, processes that involve H$_2$ and some molecular ions and, secondly, the interaction of photoelectrons with the atmosphere. We survey the literature on the chemical-collisional-radiative processes that govern the production-loss of He(2$^3S$). We simulate the atmospheric outflow from the Neptune-sized GJ 436 b by coupling a hydrodynamic model that solves the bulk properties of the gas and a Monte Carlo model that tracks the energy degradation of the photoelectrons. We identify Penning ionization of H as a key He(2$^3S$) loss process at GJ 436 b and update its rate coefficient to a value consistent with the most recent available cross sections. The update affects notably the predicted strength of the He I line. For GJ 436 b, photoelectron-driven processes (mainly ionization and excitation) modify the He(2$^3S$) population in layers too deep to affect the in-transit spectrum. The situation might be different for other atmospheres though. The spectral energy distribution of GJ 436 has a strong effect on the predicted in-transit signal. The published non-detections of the He I line for GJ 436 b are reasonably consistent with our model predictions for a solar-metallicity atmosphere when the model adopts a recently proposed spectral energy distribution. The interpretation of the He I line at 1.08 $\mu$m is model-dependent. Our revised network provides a general framework to extract more robust conclusions from measurements of this line, especially in atmospheres where H$_2$ remains abundant to high altitudes. We will explore additional, previously-ignored processes in future work.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of sulfur chemistry in a validated C/H/O/N chemical network: identification of key C/S coupling pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of SO2 in both WASP-39 b and WASP-107 b recently brought more attention to the modeling of photochemistry in exoplanets. However, sulfur kinetics data is lacking in the literature for the full C/H/O/N/S system. The networks used to model this chemistry neglect the coupling between sulfur and other C/H/O/N species. We aimed to integrate sulfur kinetics to our previously developed C_0-C_2/H/O/N chemical network, with the inclusion of its coupling to carbon and nitrogen chemistry, for conditions between 500 - 2500 K and 100 - 10^-6 bar, and any atomic composition. To achieve this reliability, we used a dual approach, deriving the network from other available combustion networks and from original ab initio calculations where data was lacking. This was performed together with an extensive validation of the network on 1606 experimental measurements from the literature on the combustion and pyrolysis of multiple sulfur compounds such as H2S, CH3SH, CS2 and OCS. To examine the consequences of this new chemical network on exoplanets atmospheric studies, we generated abundance profiles for GJ 436 b, GJ 1214 b, HD 189733 b, HD 209458 b, WASP-39 b and WASP-107 b using the 1D kinetic model FRECKLL, calculated the corresponding transmission spectra using TauREx 3.1 and compared these results with other chemical networks used in exoplanet modeling with sulfur. The coupling between carbon and sulfur chemistry is found to be impactful on both abundance profiles and observables, with CH2S being its key species. CS2 abundance is found to be probably much higher than anticipated in current kinetic networks for exoplanets. The detection of CS2 in TOI-270 d highlights the importance of using validated chemical networks to improve the reliability of our models, particularly in the JWST era. Combustion and pyrolysis data are largely available tools that reveal to be very useful for this task.</description>

      <title>The NEID Earth Twin Survey. II. Dynamical Masses in Seven High-acceleration Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of companion dynamical masses and orbital parameters of seven star systems from the NEID Earth Twin Survey with significant absolute astrometric accelerations between the epochs of Hipparcos and Gaia. These include four binary star systems (HD 68017 AB, 61 Cygni AB, HD 24496 AB, and HD 4614 AB) and three planetary systems (HD 217107, HD 190360, and HD 154345). Our analyses incorporate a long baseline of RVs that includes over 1100 previously unpublished measurements from NEID and MINERVA, extending the overall RV baseline for each system by $\approx$2.5 years, as well as relative astrometry for the stellar binary systems where the positions of both stars are well-measured. In each case, the combination of astrometry and RVs constrains the three-dimensional acceleration of the host star and enables precise dynamical masses. We publish true masses for three planets whose measurements were previously entangled with their inclinations, four stellar masses with $\lesssim$1% relative precision, and improved orbital solutions for all seven systems, including the first for HD 24496 AB. These solutions not only agree with previous estimates, but also improve their fidelity. We also explore each system for evidence of periodic signals in the residuals around our best-fit models, and discuss the potential that the three planetary systems have for being directly imaged. With dynamical mass estimates and reliable orbit ephemerides, these seven star systems represent promising benchmarks for future stellar and planetary characterization efforts, and are amenable for further improvement with the upcoming release of Gaia epoch astrometry.</description>

      <title>Determination of Jupiter's Primordial Physical State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and early evolution of Jupiter played a pivotal role in sculpting the large-scale architecture of the solar system, intertwining the narrative of Jovian early years with the broader story of the solar system's origins. The details and chronology of Jupiter's formation, however, remain elusive, primarily due to the inherent uncertainties of accretionary models, highlighting the need for independent constraints. Here we show that by analyzing the dynamics of Jupiter's satellites concurrently with its angular momentum budget, we can infer Jupiter's radius and interior state at the time of proto-solar nebula's dissipation. In particular, our calculations reveal that Jupiter was $2$ to $2.5$ times as large as it is today, 3.8 million years after the formation of the first solids in the solar system. Our model further indicates that young Jupiter possessed a magnetic field of approximately $B_{\rm{J}}^{\dagger} \approx 21$ mT (a factor of $\sim50$ higher than its present-day value) and was accreting material through a circum-Jovian disk at a rate of $\dot{M} = 1.2-2.4$ Jupiter masses per million years. Our findings are fully consistent with the core-accretion theory of giant planet formation and provide an evolutionary snapshot that pins down properties of the Jovian system at the end of the protosolar nebula's lifetime.</description>

      <title>Retention of surface water on tidally locked rocky planets in the Venus zone around M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial planets within the Venus zone surrounding M dwarf stars can retain surface ice caps on the perpetual dark side if atmospheric heat transport is inefficient, {as suggested by previous global climate simulations \citep[e.g.,][]{leconte2013}.} This condition is {proposed} to play a role in the potential regional habitability of these planets. However, the amount of surface ice may be limited by considering the water condensed from the steam atmosphere in a runaway greenhouse state, and the physical mechanism for triggering the condensation process is not clear. Here, we use a two-column moist radiative-convective-subsiding model to investigate the water condensation process on tidally locked planets from the runaway greenhouse state. We find that the water condensation process is characterized by two distinct equilibrium states under the same {incoming stellar flux}. The initiation of condensation corresponds to a warm, unstable state exhibiting positive Planck feedback, whereas the termination phase corresponds to a cold, stable state exhibiting negative Planck feedback. We further show that the surface water mass in the collapsed state {decreases with the} incoming stellar flux, background surface pressure, and optical thickness of non-condensible greenhouse gases, with a global equivalent depth of less than $\sim 20$ cm. Our two-column approach provides a straightforward way to understand the water evolution on Venus zone planets around M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>A planetary-mass candidate imaged in the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly imaged exoplanets in wide orbits challenge current gas giant formation theories. They need to form quickly and acquire enough material before the disk dissipates, which cannot be accommodated by in-situ formation by core accretion. We search for wide separation ($&gt;$ 100 au) planetary-mass companions with the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey (YSES). Here, we present a planetary-mass candidate companion discovered in the survey. We conducted follow-up observations of the candidate system after the first epoch observations and obtained six epochs of observations for this system between 2018 and 2024, and integral field spectroscopy of the stellar component. We report the detection of a candidate companion with H=22.04 $\pm$ 0.13 mag at a projected separation of 730 $\pm$ 10 au away from the primary star. High angular resolution imaging observations of the central star show it is a visual binary. Acceleration data, orbital fitting, spectral energy distribution fitting and radial velocity differences all suggest that there is at least one more unresolved low-mass stellar companion in this system. The planetary-mass candidate shows a significant proper motion comparable to that of the primary star. We estimate an age of 19-28 Myr for the primary star. We cannot confirm the companionship of the candidate due to the unknown barycentre of the stars. Long-term imaging and radial velocity monitoring of the central stars, along with spectroscopy of the candidate companion, are key to resolving the nature of this system. If confirmed, the candidate companion would have a mass of 3-5 Mj estimated with the ATMO evolutionary model. It would be another cold low-mass planet imaged similar to 51 Eri b and AF Lep b. Its extremely wide separation from the host star would challenge the formation theory of gas giant exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Insufficient evidence for DMS and DMDS in the atmosphere of K2-18 b. From a joint analysis of JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec, and MIRI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b have been interpreted as suggestive of a liquid water ocean with possible biological activity. Signatures of DMS and DMDS have been claimed in the near-infrared (using the NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments) and mid-infrared (using MIRI). However, the statistical significance of the atmospheric imprints of these potential biomarkers has yet to be quantified from a joint analysis of the entire planet spectrum. We test the robustness of the proposed DMS/DMDS detections by simultaneously modeling the NIRISS and NIRSpec observations jointly with the MIRI spectrum, considering different data reductions and modeling choices. We use three well-tested pipelines to re-reduce the JWST observations, and two retrieval codes to analyze the resulting transmission spectra as well as previously published data. Our joint analysis of the panchromatic (0.6 - 12 um) spectrum of K2-18 b finds insufficient evidence for the presence of DMS and/or DMDS in the atmosphere of the planet. Furthermore, other molecules containing methyl functional groups (e.g., ethane) with absorption bands similar to DMS/DMDS provide an equally good fit to the data. We find that any marginal preferences are the result of limiting the number of molecules considered in the model and oversensitivity to small changes between data reductions. Our results confirm that there is no statistical significance for DMS or DMDS in K2-18 b's atmosphere. While previous works have demonstrated this on MIRI or NIRISS/NIRSpec observations alone, our analysis of the full transmission spectrum does not support claims of potential biomarkers. Using the best-fitting model including DMS/DMDS on the published data, we estimate that ~25 more MIRI transits would be needed for a 3-sigma rejection of a flat line relative to DMS/DMDS features in the planet's mid-infrared transmission spectrum.</description>

      <title>Improving the discovery of near-Earth objects with machine-learning methods</title>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the digest2 parameters for candidates of the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) that were reported between 2019 and 2024. Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the inclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in near-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the NEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing time is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the candidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are insufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives and minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for NEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30 distinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as NEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based on selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs from the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also investigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is, the gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to classify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as input, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in distinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2 parameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a significant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting the loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%. Importantly, we show that most follow-up tracklets of initially misclassified NEOs are later correctly identified as NEOs.</description>

      <title>Plasma refilling of the lunar wake: plasma-vacuum interactions, electrostatic shocks, and electromagnetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plasma void forms downstream of the Moon when the solar wind impacts the lunar surface. This void gradually refills as the solar wind passes by, forming the lunar wake. We investigate this refilling process using a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The early stage of refilling follows plasma-vacuum interaction theory, characterized by exponential decay of plasma density into the wake, along with ion acceleration and cooling in the expansion direction. Our PIC simulation confirms these theoretical predictions. In the next stage of the refilling process, the counter-streaming supersonic ion beams collide, generating Debye-scale electrostatic shocks at the wake's center. These shocks decelerate and thermalize the ion beams while heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions along magnetic field lines. Additionally, fast magnetosonic waves undergo convective growth via anomalous cyclotron resonance as they co-propagate with temperature-anisotropic ion beams toward the wake's center. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves may also be excited through normal cyclotron resonance, counter-propagating with these anisotropic ion beams. Our findings provide new insights into the kinetic aspects of lunar wake refilling and may enhance interpretation of spacecraft observations.</description>

      <title>Electric fields and waves in the Venus nightside magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On November 6, 2024, the Parker Solar Probe flew past Venus to make the first accurate electric field measurement in the nightside Venusian magnetosphere. To achieve this result, the electric field antennas were current biased in a way never before experienced by an electric field detector. This biasing requirement, that the positive bias current in the Venus shadow be about equal to the electron thermal current, is discussed and illustrated. About one minute of useful electric f ield data in the eight-minute nightside magnetosphere crossing was obtained, during which the only feature observed was a few Hz signal. This result, along with the magnetic field measurements, showed that there were few if any electromagnetic waves, such as low-frequency electromagnetic turbulence or whistlers, in the nightside crossing. Instead, a few Hertz, purely electrostatic signal was found. This suggests that the interaction of the solar wind with an unmagnetized body having an ionosphere may be different from that of previously studied magnetized bodies. In the sunlit flanks, many electromagnetic wave modes were observed. These results describe the first step in the proper technique for future measurements of electric fields in shadow.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation on the Compressive Behavior of Hierarchical Granular Piles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical granular piles composed of aggregates are key structural features in both geoscience and planetary science, from fault gouge in seismic zones to the internal structures of comets. Although experimental studies have suggested a multi-step evolution in their packing structure, this hypothesis has lacked numerical validation. In this study, we performed large-scale numerical simulations using the discrete element method to investigate the compressive behavior of hierarchical granular piles. We successfully reproduced and confirmed a three-stage evolution process: (i) rearrangement of the aggregate packing structure, (ii) plastic deformation of small aggregates, and (iii) elastic deformation of constituent particles. Additionally, we developed a semi-analytical model for the compression curve, offering insights into the compressive stages and structural dynamics. Our findings have applications in modeling the internal density profiles of comets and in understanding the early thermal evolution of small icy bodies.</description>

      <title>Observing the Sun with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST): Forecasting Full-disk Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionised the field of solar millimetre astronomy with its high angular resolution and cadence. However, with a limited field of view (FOV), targeted observations of highly dynamic phenomena such of flares are challenging. A large aperture single-dish telescope with a large FOV, such as the future Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), would prove useful in observing such phenomena, as one could scan the full solar disk on shorter timescales. We aimed to explore what FOVs, detector counts, and scan strategies are suitable for AtLAST to push the required full-disk scan times below 1 minute, enabling regular observations of dynamic solar phenomena. Utilising the maria code, we were able to simulate solar observations with AtLAST, and thoroughly explored how instrumental properties and scanning strategies affect the full-disk observations in the planned frequency bands. We find the double-circle scan pattern, currently employed at ALMA for full-disk mapping to also be an acceptable way of scanning the Sun with AtLAST. Using small to intermediately sized instruments (1000 - 50,000 detector elements), the estimated observational cadence would be less than 1 minute across AtLAST's frequency range with a reasonable pixel spacing. Using instruments with larger FOVs ($\gtrapprox 0.25^\circ$, equivalent to $\gtrapprox$ 1 R$_\odot$), we find a simple circular scan to be more efficient, achieving cadences on second time scales, but requiring more detector elements ($\gtrapprox$ 100,000). We find that a large FOV single-dish telescope such as AtLAST could provide the solar millimetre community with hitherto unachievable observations, namely full-disk observations at high cadence and adequate resolution. With cadences potentially down to seconds, such an instrument would be ideal in the study of quickly evolving solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>Detecting Exomoons in Free-Floating-Planet Events from Space-based Microlensing Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a planet is ejected from its star-planet system due to dynamical interactions, its satellite may remain gravitationally bound to the planet. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will be capable of detecting a large number of low-mass free-floating planet events (FFPs) from a bulge microlensing survey. We assess the feasibility of detecting satellites (a.k.a., exomoons) orbiting FFPs by simulating CSST light curves and calculating the detection efficiency as a function of satellite-to-planet mass ratios (q) and projected separations (s) in units of the Einstein radius. For a Neptune-class FFP in the Galactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect Earth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and has sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has some sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an Earth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for detecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like source. We also calculate the satellite detection efficiency for the dedicated microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), which demonstrates greater sensitivity than CSST, particularly for M-dwarf sources. Notably, some of the Neptune-Earth systems detectable by CSST and Roman may exhibit significant tidal heating.</description>

      <title>The Receding Cosmic Shoreline of Mid-to-Late M Dwarfs: Measurements of Active Lifetimes Worsen Challenges for Atmosphere Retention by Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets is a key goal of exoplanetary astronomy, one that may now be within reach given the upcoming campaign to conduct a large-scale survey of rocky M-dwarf worlds with the James Webb Space Telescope. It is imperative that we understand where known planets sit relative to the cosmic shoreline, the boundary between planets that have retained atmospheres and those that have not. Previous works modeled the historic XUV radiation received by mid-to-late M-dwarf planets using a scaling relation calibrated using more massive stars, but fully convective M dwarfs display unique rotation/activity histories that differ from Sun-like stars and early M dwarfs. We synthesize observations of the active lifetimes of mid-to-late M dwarfs to present an updated estimate of their historic XUV fluence. For known planets of inactive, mid-to-late M dwarfs, we calculate a historic XUV fluence that is 2.1-3.1 times the canonical XUV scaling relation on average, with the larger value including corrections for the pre-main-sequence phase and energetic flares. We find that only the largest terrestrial planets known to orbit mid-to-late M-dwarfs are likely to have retained atmospheres within the cosmic shoreline paradigm. Our calculations may help to guide the selection of targets for JWST and may prove useful in interpreting the results; to this end, we define a novel Atmosphere Retention Metric (ARM) that indicates the distance between a planet and the cosmic shoreline, and tabulate the ARM for known mid-to-late M-dwarf planets.</description>

      <title>Inferring Fireball Velocity Profiles and Characteristic Parameters of Meteoroids from Incomplete Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting additional information from old or incomplete fireball datasets remains a challenge. To address missing point-by-point observations, we introduce a method for estimating atmospheric flight parameters of meteoroids using metaheuristic optimization techniques. Using a fireball catalog from the European Fireball Network (EN), we reconstruct velocity profiles, meteoroid bulk densities, mass loss rates, and ablation and ballistic coefficients, based on the initial and terminal points' height, velocity, and mass with the purely dynamical $\alpha$-$\beta$ model. Additionally, the method's performance is compared to the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project (MORP) derived fits, confirming the robustness of the computed parameters for objects with asteroidal compositions. Our findings show that $\alpha$-$\beta$ model yields parameters consistent with the photometric and dynamic mass estimates in the EN catalog for $P_E$ type I events. However, in the implementation proposed here, $\alpha$-$\beta$ model encounters limitations in accurately representing the final deceleration of more fragile high-velocity meteoroids. This is likely due to challenges in representing complex fragmentation processes by fitting only two points, even when initial and terminal residuals are minimal. The retrieved $\alpha$-$\beta$ distribution differs from the one derived from MORP data, likely due to the imposed mass constraints, which strongly influence the results, especially the bulk density. The results suggest that $P_E$ constraints reduce fitting accuracy (from 90% to 44%), while flexibility and freedom from assumptions improve $\alpha$-$\beta$ performance. The method yields 26% of the events compatible with the catalog $P_E$ classification. Our approach is well-suited for interpreting historical or sparse datasets.</description>
