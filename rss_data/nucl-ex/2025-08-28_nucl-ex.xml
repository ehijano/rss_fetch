      <title>$\Sigma^{+}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of $\Sigma^{+}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV is presented. The measurement is performed at midrapidity in both minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The $\Sigma^{+}$ is reconstructed via its weak-decay topology in the decay channel $\Sigma^{+} \rightarrow {\rm p} + \pi^{0}$ with $\pi^{0} \rightarrow \gamma + \gamma$. In a novel approach, the neutral pion is reconstructed by combining photons that convert in the detector material with photons measured in the calorimeters. The transverse-momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) distributions of the $\Sigma^{+}$ and its rapidity densities ${\rm d}N$/${\rm d}y$ in both event classes are reported. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectrum in minimum-bias collisions is compared to QCD-inspired event generators. The ratio of $\Sigma^{+}$ to previously measured $\Lambda$ baryons is in good agreement with calculations from the Statistical Hadronization Model. The high efficiency and purity of the novel reconstruction method for $\Sigma^{+}$ presented here will enable future studies of the interaction of $\Sigma^{+}$ with protons in the context of femtoscopic measurements, which could be crucial for understanding the equation of state of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>First Observation of Solar Neutrino Interactions on $^{13}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SNO+ Collaboration reports the first evidence of $^{8}\text{B}$ solar neutrinos interacting on $^{13}\text{C}$ nuclei. The charged current interaction proceeds through $^{13}\text{C} + \nu_e \rightarrow {}^{13}\text{N} + e^-$ which is followed, with a 10 minute half-life, by ${}^{13}\text{N} \rightarrow {}^{13}\text{C} + e^+ +\nu_e .$ The detection strategy is based on the delayed coincidence between the electron and the positron. Evidence for the charged current signal is presented with a significance of 4.2$\sigma$. Using the natural abundance of $^{13}\text{C}$ present in the scintillator, 5.7 tonnes of $^{13}\text{C}$ over 231 days of data were used in this analysis. The 5.6$^{+3.0}_{-2.3}$ detected events in the data set are consistent with the expectation of 4.7$^{+0.6}_{-1.3}$ events. This result is the second real-time measurement of CC interactions of $^{8}\text{B}$ neutrinos with nuclei and constitutes the lowest energy observation of neutrino interactions on $^{13}\text{C}$ generally. This enables the first direct measurement of the CC $\nu_e$ reaction to the ground state of ${}^{13}\text{N}$, yielding an average cross section of $(16.1 ^{+8.5}_{-6.7} (\text{stat.}) ^{+1.6}_{-2.7} (\text{syst.}) )\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^{2}$ over the relevant $^{8}\text{B}$ solar neutrino energies.</description>

      <title>Spectral line-shape in collinear laser spectroscopy after atomic charge exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collinear laser spectroscopy experiments on fast, neutral beams have been extensively used for studies on short-lived radioactive nuclei, taking advantage of its high sensitivity. The resulting resonance line-shape is known to show significant distortion, due to the energy exchange during the charge-exchange neutralization process, which can cause large systematic uncertainty in the determined centroid. A model for the line shape was constructed and simulated to be compared to measured Al, Si, and Ni hyperfine spectra. It is shown that the distortion is caused mainly by the transfer of electron into many different energy levels in the projectile atom and subsequent decays, rather than secondary inelastic collisions, which were often assumed in the line shape analysis before. The model can also be applied to other projectile-alkali pairs, providing a reliable line-shape with less fitting parameters than conventional phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Configuration mixing effects on neutrinoless $\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixing and coexistence of intrinsic nuclear shapes play an important role to determine the low-energy structure of heavy nuclei, and are expected to affect nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. This problem is addressed in the interacting boson model with configuration mixing that is formulated by using the nuclear energy density functional theory. It is shown that significant amounts of mixing of normal and deformed intruder configurations are present in the ground and excited $0^+$ states in the even-even nuclei that are parent or daughter nuclei of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. An illustrative application to the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays of $^{76}$Ge, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, and $^{150}$Nd shows that the inclusion of the configuration mixing reduces the NMEs for most of the $0^+_1$ $\to$ $0^+_1$ $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

      <title>$\Xi NN$ three-baryon force from SU(3) chiral effective field theory: A femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The development of SU(3) chiral effective field theory has opened the way to a systematic exploration of three-baryon forces (3BFs), a key ingredient in hypernuclear and dense matter physics. However, $\Xi NN$ 3BF based on SU(3) chiral EFT has not been studied until now.
  Purpose: We apply SU(3) chiral EFT for the first time to derive $\Xi NN$ potentials in momentum space. Then, we investigate how the $\Xi NN$ 3BF affects the correlation function of deuteron-$\Xi^-$ pair created through heavy-ion collisions.
  Methods: To reduce the number of low-energy constants involved in the $\Xi NN$ potentials, we employ the decuplet saturation approximation, by which only two of them remain unconstrained.
  Results: We found that the effect of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF on the deuteron-$\Xi^-$ correlation function is at most about 4%. This is because the deuteron and $\Xi^-$ interact with each other mainly at low momentum, corresponding to peripheral scattering, where the influence of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF is limited.
  Conclusions: High-momentum scattering of the deuteron off $\Xi^-$ is expected to be a promising probe of the $\Xi NN$ 3BF, offering an alternative to femtoscopic analyses of the correlation function.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for jet modification in the presence of the QGP background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet interactions with the color-deconfined QCD medium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are conventionally assessed by measuring the modification of the distributions of jet observables with respect to their baselines in proton-proton collisions. Deep learning methods enable per-jet evaluation of these modifications, enhancing the use of jets as precision probes of the nuclear medium. In this work, we predict the jet-by-jet fractional energy loss $\chi$ for jets evolving through a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. To approximate realistic experimental conditions, we embed medium-modified jets in a thermal background and apply Constituent Subtraction for background removal. Two network architectures are studied: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet images, and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) using particle clouds. We find that CNNs achieve accurate predictions for background-free jets but degrade in the presence of the QGP background and remain below the background-free baseline even after background subtraction. In contrast, DGCNNs applied to background-subtracted particle clouds maintain high accuracy across the entire $\chi$ range, demonstrating the advantage of point-cloud-based graph neural networks that exploit full jet structure under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Thomson coefficient of quark-gluon plasma in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collision experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider offer a unique platform to study several key properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of strongly interacting matter. Quarks, being the electrically charged particles, can induce an electric current in the medium in response to the temperature gradients. Hence, the QGP medium can behave like a thermoelectric medium. The thermoelectric coefficients, such as the Seebeck and Thomson coefficients, can help us to understand the intricate transport phenomenon of the medium. In peripheral collisions, the intense, transient, and time-dependent magnetic field created due to spectator protons significantly influences the thermoelectric properties of the QGP medium, affecting the charge and heat transport. This work uses the quasi-particle model to calculate the Thomson coefficient in QGP. The Thomson effect, describing the continuous heating or cooling of the charge-carrying medium in the presence of temperature gradients, remains largely unexplored in QGP. The Seebeck effect, which relates temperature gradients to induced electric fields, has been widely studied in the literature. For the first time, we calculate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. We have studied their dependence on temperature, baryon chemical potential, center of mass energy, and time-dependent magnetic field with different decay parameters. The transverse Thomson effect originates due to the presence of the Nernst effect in the presence of a magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the higher-order thermoelectric transport properties of the QGP medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry properties of pair correlations in heavy deformed nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleons are known to form pairing correlations with various types of spin-symmetries. Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''</description>

      <title>Photonuclear Tomography in Ultraperipheral Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of photonuclear tomography as a novel technique for probing the internal structure of nuclei. In this approach, ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) serve as a source of intense fluxes of virtual photons, which induce coherent production of vector mesons. By analyzing the probabilities and cross sections of these photon-induced processes, we propose a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of nucleons within the nucleus. Our framework provides a systematic way to access information on the nuclear geometry probed in UPCs, offering new opportunities for studies of nuclear structure using particle production as a probe. Numerical calculations for selected examples illustrate the feasibility and potential of this method.</description>
