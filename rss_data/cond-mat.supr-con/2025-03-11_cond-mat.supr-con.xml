      <title>Spin-polarized superconductivity from excitonic Cooper pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of spin-polarized superconductivity from the condensation of excitonic Cooper pairs, which are charge-$2e$ bosonic quasiparticles made of Cooper pairs strongly hybridized with excitons. By solving a model of spin-polarized electrons using the strong-coupling expansion to the second order, we demonstrate the emergence of excitonic Cooper pairs from electron-hole fluctuations upon doping a strongly correlated insulator. We characterize their binding energy, effective mass, and the resulting superconducting transition temperature. We propose possible realization of spin-polarized superconductivity in twisted semiconductors with honeycomb moir\'e superlattice.</description>

      <title>Pressure Effect on the Spin Density Wave Transition in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{6.96}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-pressure studies reveal a stark contrast between the superconducting properties of double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. While La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ exhibits bulk superconductivity, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ displays filamentary behavior, suggesting that superconductivity is confined to phase interfaces rather than the bulk. Since magnetism emerges near the superconducting phase, understanding its differences in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ is essential for clarifying their underlying electronic and magnetic properties. In this work we study the magnetic responce of La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{6.96}$ under pressures up to 2.3 GPa using the muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) technique. The application of external pressure increases the N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$ from approximately 161 K at ambient pressure ($p=0$) to about 170 K at $p=2.3$ GPa. The temperature dependence of the internal magnetic field $B_{\rm int}(T)$ (i.e., the magnetic order parameter) follows the power-law relation $B_{\rm int} = B_{\rm int}(0) \left(1 - \left[T/T_{\rm N}\right]^\alpha \right)^\beta$, with consistent exponent values of $\alpha\simeq 1.95$ and $\beta\simeq 0.35$ across different pressures. The value of the ordered moments at the Ni sites, which is proportional to $B_{\rm int}$, remain unaffected by pressure. Our findings suggest that the magnetic properties of double-layer RP nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are broadly unaffected by Pr to La substitution.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd-parity pairings offer a natural pathway for realizing topological superconductivity. When two identical even-parity superconductors form a $\pi$-junction, the metallic material sandwiched between them experiences an effective odd-parity pairing, facilitating the emergence of topological superconductivity in the intermediate region. In this work, we consider the intermediate material to be a two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Dirac semimetal. When the two superconductors are conventional s-wave superconductors, we find that a helical topological superconductor can be realized. This phase is characterized by the presence of a pair of helical Majorana edge states. Interestingly, when the superconductors are $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductors, we observe not only the helical topological superconductor but also an unconventional topological superconductor. The latter is distinguished by the existence of two pairs of helical Majorana edge states, despite the fact that the global topological invariants for this system take on trivial values. By further applying an in-plane magnetic field, we demonstrate that second-order topological superconducting phases can be achieved. These phases host isolated Majorana corner modes as well as twofold Majorana corner modes. Our findings reveal that two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals can support a rich variety of topological superconducting phases, offering a versatile platform for exploring exotic topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Magnon-mediated superconductivity on ferromagnetic wallpaper fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional superconductivity mediated by magnetic fluctuations at the interface between a ferromagnetic insulator and the nonsymmorphic topological crystalline insulator with a fourfold-degenerate Dirac point, wallpaper fermion. We demonstrate that BCS pairing with zero center-of-mass momentum induces chiral $p$-wave superconductivity, and the Amperean pairing with center-of-mass momentum $2k_{\rm F}$ can give rise to a parity-mixed superconducting state. We find that the Amperean pairing exhibits a mixture of $s$-wave and $p$-wave components due to the multiband nature of the wallpaper fermion and the easy-axis anisotropy of the ferromagnetic insulator. Additionally, we find that the stability of the superconducting state with BCS and the Amperean pairing is governed by the easy-axis anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Relative phase between $s_{\pm}$ superconducting order parameter components in a two-band model with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain solutions for Eliashberg equations within the Nambu representation for a two-band model of iron-based superconductors with nonmagnetic impurities. Two cases of a transition between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states are considered: (i) the transition is accompanied by the abrupt change of the order parameter sign within one of the bands and (ii) the change is smooth. For both cases, we studied the role of a gauge defined by the coefficients preceding the Pauli matrices $\hat\tau_1$ and $\hat\tau_2$ in a self-energy expansion, which correspond to the components of the order parameter. We show that the absolute value of the order parameter is conserved for solutions in the clean and in the Born limits. In an intermediate case, between the Born and unitary limits, result depends on the solution for the clean limit. We show that a common gauge for the Eliashberg equations in which one of the order parameter components vanishes is essential for adequate description of the multiband superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of next-nearest neighbor hopping on the pairing and critical temperatures of the attractive Hubbard model on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attractive Hubbard model plays a paradigmatic role in the study of superconductivity (superfluidity) and has become directly realizable in ultracold atom experiments on optical lattices. However, the critical temperatures, $T_c$'s, remain lower than the lowest temperatures currently achievable in experiments. Here, we explore a possible route to enhance $T_c$ by introducing an additional next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, $t^\prime$, in a two-dimensional square lattice. We perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to compute response functions such as pairing correlation functions, superfluid density, and uniform spin susceptibility. Our results show that a judicious choice of $t^\prime$ can increase $Tc$ by up to $50\%$ compared to the case with only nearest-neighbor hopping. In contrast, the preformed pairs temperature scale, named pairing temperature, $T_p$, decreases with increasing $|t^{\prime}/t|$, which should represent a reduction of the pseudogap region, favoring a more BCS-like behavior at intermediate coupling. We further analyze the interacting density of states to characterize the transition from a pseudogap regime to a fully gapped superconducting state. These findings suggest that NNN hopping could be a viable route to increase $T_c$ to values closer to experimentally accessible temperature scales.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Multipolar Order and Multipole-Induced Superconductivity in PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipolar moments entail a new route to tackle frontier problems in superconductivity (SC). A key progress in the search for multipolar SC is the discovery of Pr$Tr_2$Al$_{20}$ ($Tr =$ Ti, V), which possesses quadrupolar and octupolar but no magnetic dipolar moments. The Kondo entanglement of these multipolar moments with conduction electrons leads to exotic SC within the multipolar ordered phase, though the precise nature of the SC remains unexplored. We experimentally investigate the SC gap structure of SC in PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ and its La-doping evolution. Our results indicate deviations from a single $s$-wave gap, instead favoring nodal $d$-wave or multiple gaps. While the SC is robust against La dilution, the SC gap structure changes with minimal La doping, coinciding with a sharp change in the ferroquadrupolar (FQ) order. This suggests an intimate link between the quadrupolar order parameter and SC pairing, providing insight into the coexistence of SC with multipolar order.</description>

      <title>Engineering Andreev Bound States for Thermal Sensing in Proximity Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal response of proximity Josephson junctions (JJs) is governed by the temperature ($T$)-dependent occupation of Andreev bound states (ABS), making them promising candidates for sensitive thermal detection. In this study, we systematically engineer ABS to enhance the thermal sensitivity of the critical current ($I_c$) of proximity JJs, quantified as $|\,dI_c/dT\,|$ for the threshold readout scheme and $|\,dI_c/dT \cdot I_c^{-1}\,|$ for the inductive readout scheme. Using a gate-tunable graphene-based JJ platform, we explore the impact of key parameters -- including channel length, transparency, carrier density, and superconducting material -- on the thermal response. Our results reveal that the proximity-induced superconducting gap plays a crucial role in optimizing thermal sensitivity. Notably, we see a maximum $|\,dI_c/dT \cdot I_c^{-1}\,|$ value of $0.6\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ at low temperatures with titanium-based graphene JJs. By demonstrating a systematic approach to engineering ABS in proximity JJs, this work establishes a versatile framework for optimizing thermal sensors and advancing the study of ABS-mediated transport.</description>

      <title>Anomalous behaviour of the temperature dependencies of the upper critical fields in (Dy1-xErx)Rh3.8Ru0.2B4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, a detailed analysis of the behaviour of the temperature dependences of the upper critical fields Hc2(T) has been carried out in the compounds (Dy1-xErx)Rh3.8Ru0.2B4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4). It is found that the Hc2(T) in (Dy0.8Er0.2)Rh3.8Ru0.2B4 has an inflection point at 3 kOe, which may be related to the low-temperature magnetic ordering, while a more exotic mechanism caused by the transition from ordinary singlet to triplet superconductivity is not excluded. For the first time, the experimental Hc2(T) dependences of (Dy1-xErx)Rh3.8Ru0.2B4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4) compounds have been fitted within the framework of Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory (WHH) with the Maki parameter alpha &gt; 0, indicating that spin-paramagnetic effects due to magnetic exchange interactions play an essential role in suppressing superconductivity in these compounds.</description>

      <title>Prediction of high-temperature ambient-pressure superconductivity in hexagonal boron-rich clathrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent predictions of superconductivity in B-C framework clathrates, we employ density functional theory to explore potential superconductors among hexagonal hydride-substituted compounds with compositions XB$_8$C, XB$_7$C$_2$, XB$_6$C$_3$, XB$_3$C$_6$, XB$_2$C$_7$, and XBC$_8$. Our high-throughput calculations on 96 compounds reveal several dynamically stable candidates exhibiting superconductivity at ambient pressure. Analysis of electronic structures and electron-phonon coupling demonstrates that CaB$_8$C, SrB$_8$C, and BaB$_8$C possess superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$) exceeding 50 K, with CaB$_8$C exhibiting the highest predicted $T_c$ of 77.1 K among all stable compounds studied. These findings expand the family of B-C clathrate superconductors and provide valuable insights for experimental efforts aimed at discovering novel superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Vortex frequency locking and Shapiro steps in superconductor open nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movement of magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) in superconductors leads to dissipation and is influenced by various ordering effects arising from vortex-vortex, vortex-defect, and vortex-edge interactions. Under combined dc and ac stimuli, when the distance traveled by fluxons during an ac cycle corresponds to an integer multiple of the vortex lattice period, the superconductor's current-voltage (I-V) curve displays synchronization (Shapiro) steps. However, in planar constrictions, frequency-locking effects rely on a perfectly ordered vortex lattice and are typically observed when periodic vortex pinning arrays dominate over intrinsic uncorrelated disorder. Here, we propose 3D superconducting open nanotubes as systems free of periodic disorder, where the I-V curves are expected to display pronounced Shapiro steps. Using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, we attribute the predicted effect to a reduction in the dimensionality of vortex motion. Namely, rolling a planar film into a tube causes the 2D vortex array, which initially moves throughout the film, to evolve into quasi-1D vortex chains that are restricted to areas where the normal component of the magnetic field is near its maximum. The discussed effects are relevant for superconducting devices, where vortex nucleation frequency and voltage stabilization by an external ac stimulus can enhance their operation.</description>

      <title>Helical edge states and enhanced superconducting gaps in Bi islands on FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By measuring scanning tunneling spectroscopy on some large Bi islands deposited on FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ superconductors, we observe clear evidence of topological in-gap edge states with double peaks at about $\pm 1.0$ meV on the spectra measured near the perimeter of the islands. The edge states spread towards the inner side of the islands over a width of 2-3 nm. The two edge-state peaks at positive and negative energies both move to higher values with increase of the magnetic field, and they disappear near the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ of FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$. The edge states are interpreted as the counter-propagating topological edge states induced by the strong spin-orbit coupling effect of the Bi island, and the zero-energy mode emerges when the edge states touch each other in some small Bi islands. Meanwhile, enhanced superconducting gaps are observed in the central regions of these Bi islands, which may be induced by the enhanced pair potential of the topological surface state. Our observations provide useful message for the nontrivial topological superconductivity on specific Bi islands grown on FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ substrate.</description>

      <title>Volume dependence of microwave induced excess quasiparticles in superconducting resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of quasiparticles typically degrades the performance of superconducting microwave circuits. The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of the role of lattice vibrations in the formation of the pseudogap state in strongly correlated electron systems has been investigated concerning changes in the electron-phonon coupling parameters and the concentration of doped charge carriers. We apply the polaronic version of the generalized tight-binding method to analyze the band structure of a realistic multiband two-dimensional model that incorporates the electron-lattice contributions of both Holstein and Peierls types. It has been demonstrated that the emergence of polaronic effects begins with the modulation of spectral function intensity. However, within a specific region of the phase diagram, a significant transformation of the electron band structure and pseudogap state occurs. It results from coherent polaron excitations that create a partially flat band near the Fermi level. This process leads to a change in the topology of the Fermi surface and the emergence of corresponding features in the density of states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents comprising Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Probing the Design Space of InSb Topological Superconductor Nanowires for the Realization of Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection. Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to host MZMs. We employ eigenspectra analysis and quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states, transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</description>

      <title>Origin of switchable quasiparticle-interference chirality in loop-current phase of kagome metals measured by scanning-tunneling-microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral loop-current (LC) phase in kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K) has attracted considerable attention as a novel quantum state driven by electron correlations. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments have provided strong evidence for the chiral LC phase through the detection of chirality in the quasiparticle interference (QPI) signal. However, the fundamental relationship between ``QPI chirality'' and ``LC chirality'' remains unexplored. For instance, the QPI signal is unchanged even when all LC orders are inverted. Furthermore, only the chiral LC order cannot induce QPI chirality. At present, the true essence of kagome metals that we should learn from the remarkable QPI experiments remains elusive. To address this, we investigate the origin of the QPI signal in the LC phase using a large unit-cell tight-binding model for kagome metals. The LC phase gives rise to a $Z_3$ nematic phase, characterized by three distinct directors, under the Star-of-David bond order. Our findings demonstrate that the QPI chirality induced by a single impurity at site Z, denoted as $\chi_Z$, can take values of $\pm1$ (chiral) or 0 (achiral), depending on the direction of the $Z_3$ nematic order. Prominent QPI chirality originates from extremely dilute impurities ($\lesssim$0.1%) in the present mechanism. Notably, $\chi_Z$ ($=\pm1$, 0) changes smoothly with minimal free-energy barriers by applying a small magnetic field $B_z$, accompanied by a switching of the $Z_3$ nematic director. This study provides a comprehensive explanation for the observed ``$B_z$-switchable QPI chirality'' in regions with dilute impurities, offering fundamental insight into the chiral LC in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle poisoning of superconducting qubits with active gamma irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a high-energy particle, such as a $\gamma$-ray or muon, impacts the substrate of a superconducting qubit chip, large numbers of electron-hole pairs and phonons are created. The ensuing dynamics of the electrons and holes changes the local offset-charge environment for qubits near the impact site. The phonons that are produced have energy above the superconducting gap in the films that compose the qubits, leading to quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting ground state when the phonons impinge on the qubit electrodes. An elevated density of quasiparticles degrades qubit coherence, leading to errors in qubit arrays. Because these pair-breaking phonons spread throughout much of the chip, the errors can be correlated across a large portion of the array, posing a significant challenge for quantum error correction. In order to study the dynamics of $\gamma$-ray impacts on superconducting qubit arrays, we use a $\gamma$-ray source outside the dilution refrigerator to controllably irradiate our devices. By using charge-sensitive transmon qubits, we can measure both the offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning due to the $\gamma$ irradiation at different doses. We study correlations between offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning for different qubits in the array and compare this with numerical modeling of charge and phonon dynamics following a $\gamma$-ray impact. We thus characterize the poisoning footprint of these impacts and quantify the performance of structures for mitigating phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning.</description>

      <title>Spatial Chern-Simons Interactions and Complex Magnetic Penetration Depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:1610.07414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the Landau-Ginzburg theory in the presence of spatial Chern-Simons interactions, which typically emerge in Weyl semimetals due to domain-wall motion. We demonstrate that the incorporation of a purely spatial Chern-Simons term, which violates parity, into the Landau-Ginzburg free energy leads to a complex magnetic penetration depth. This characteristic indicates that, aside from possessing an effective penetration depth, the magnetic field on the surface of the superconductor experiences periodic spatial oscillations, which significantly deviates from the conventional Meissner effect. In particular, we observe that as the degree of parity breaking, quantified by the strength of the spatial Chern-Simons term, increases, a vortex solution with magnetic field inversion may emerge. With the discovery of superconductivity in certain Weyl semimetals, we anticipate the possibility of experimentally observing this phenomenon in these materials.</description>

      <title>Orientation-dependent superconductivity and electronic structure of the rare-earth metal/KTaO3 interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based interfaces has attracted considerable interest, while the underlying origin remains an open question. Here we report a different approach to tune the interfacial electron gas and superconductivity by forming interfaces between rare-earth (RE) metals (RE being La, Ce, Eu) and KTaO3 substrates with different orientations. We found that the interfacial superconductivity is strongest for the Eu/KTaO3 interfaces, becomes weaker in La/KTaO3 and is absent in Ce/KTaO3. Using in-situ photoemission, we observed distinct valence bands associated with RE metals, as well as a pronounced orientation dependence in the interfacial electronic structure, which can be linked to the orientation-dependent superconductivity. The photoemission spectra show similar double-peak structures for the (111) and (110) oriented interfaces, with an energy separation close to the LO4 phonon of KTaO3. Detailed analyses suggest that this double-peak structure could be attributed to electron-phonon coupling, which might be important for the interfacial superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $(T_c)$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$), while further $T_c$ improvements may be achieved with applied strain. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $(\Delta)$ and electron-phonon coupling $(\lambda)$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which may be influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the challenging problem of identifying the quantum spin liquid candidate in the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. By integrating the Gutzwiller-guided density matrix renormalization group method with analytical analyses, we present clear evidence that the ground state is a Z$_2$ Dirac spin liquid. This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.</description>

      <title>Inductively coupled Josephson junctions: a platform for rich neuromorphic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are by nature neuromorphic hardware devices capable of mimicking excitability and spiking dynamics. When coupled together or combined with other superconducting elements, they can emulate additional behaviors found in biological neurons. From a technological point of view, JJ-based neuromorphic systems are particularly appealing since they present THz-speed processing and they operate with near-zero power dissipation. In this work we study a system of inductively coupled JJs and focus on the nonlinear dynamical aspects of its neurocomputational properties. In particular, we report on spiking behavior related to a saddle-node off invariant cycle bifurcation and excitability type 2, synchronization, first spike latency effects, and multistability. Special emphasis is placed on the bursting dynamics the system is capable of reproducing, and a new underlying mechanism is proposed beyond the approach followed in prior works.</description>

Abstract: We study the nature of orbital correlations present in the bilayer nickelate within a minimal two-orbital tight-binding model to gain insights into their possible role in stabilizing the less-known weakly-insulating state. The latter has been observed experimentally at ambient pressure. In order to achieve this objective, we examine the static orbital susceptibilities within the random-phase approximation. Our study highlights the sensitivity of orbital correlations to various factors including the interlayer coupling, carrier concentration, band-structure details such as the orbital contents, the number of bands contributing at the Fermi level etc. We relate this sensitiveness to the modification of the Fermi surfaces as well as their orbital contents dependent on aforementioned factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a dominant ferromagnetic instability coexisting with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>The route of shear to Ising superconductivity in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moir\'e supercell. In this regime, the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. The strong signal of symmetry breaking favors the onset of a pairing instability in which the electrons with opposite spin projection in the Cooper pairs live in different valleys. The Fermi lines become distorted due to the repulsive Coulomb interaction, which makes the screening highly anisotropic, leading easily to attraction in some of the interaction channels. We also show that the sheared graphene bilayers offer the possibility to realize the combined breakdown of parity and valley symmetry, making them very suitable to study the interplay between correlations and topology in a two-dimensional electron system.</description>
