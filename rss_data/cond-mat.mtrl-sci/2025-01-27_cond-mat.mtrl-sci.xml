      <title>AtomProNet: Data flow to and from machine learning interatomic potentials in materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the atomistic simulations of materials science move from traditional potentials to machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), the field is entering the second phase focused on discovering and explaining new material phenomena. While MLIP development relies on curated data and flexible datasets from ab-initio simulations, transitioning seamlessly between ab-initio workflows and MLIP frameworks remains challenging. A global survey was conducted to understand the current standing (progress and bottleneck) of the machine learning-guided materials science research. The survey responses have been implemented to design an open-source software to reduce the access barriers of MLIP models for the global scientific community. Here, we present AtomProNet, an open-source Python package that automates obtaining atomic structures, prepares and submits ab-initio jobs, and efficiently collects batch-processed data for streamlined neural network (NN) training. Finally, we compared empirical and start-of-the-art machine learning potential, showing the practicality of using MLIPs based on computational time and resources.</description>

      <title>Topological Influence of Sextets on Graphene Oxide Nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene Oxide (GO) remains a perennial chemical enigma despite its utility in preparing graphene and its functionalization. Epoxides and tertiary alcohols are construed as primary functional groups, but the structural motifs, spectra, and physicochemical properties remain largely inexplicable. Our graph theoretic perturbational analysis of introducing defects (sp3 carbons) on graphene shows the induction of sextets that topologically force 1, 4-quinoidal channels. Edge defects minimize these, whose propagation is halted by vertex anti-defects. Molecular models show that epoxidation creates a diradical centered on two cove-end carbons due to close-lying frontier orbitals. This drives the cascade addition of hydroxides, yielding the 1:2 ratio of epoxides and hydroxides. This nanostructure accounts for the cation exchange, acidity, anionic nature of GO, and topological conditions that break its sigma framework. The simulated spectra of a 2D sheet with this nanostructure correlate pleasantly with experiments, emphasizing the dominant role of sextet topology on the surface chemistry of graphene.</description>

      <title>First-principles Study of Metallic-atom Diffusion in Thermoelectric Material Mg$_3$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ is a promising thermoelectric material that consists of nontoxic and earth-abundant elements. We investigate metallic-atom diffusion in Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ by calculating the defect formation energy and the diffusion energy barrier for several kinds of metallic-atom impurities. We find that early transition metals, including $4d$ elements, with a large atomic radius have a high defect formation energy, whereas Mg and late transition metals such as Ni, Cu, and Zn have relatively low formation energies as interstitial impurities. Interstitial Ni, which is found to have a very low defect formation energy, might diffuse in the $ab$ plane at high temperatures with the energy barrier of 0.7 eV, while it seems difficult to diffuse in the $c$ direction. Interstitial Cu has a higher defect formation energy than Ni but has a low energy barrier of $\sim$0.4 eV for diffusion in the $ab$ plane. This study will offer important knowledge for developing a thermoelectric device of Mg$_3$Sb$_2$.</description>

      <title>Observation of Giant Orbital Hall Effect in Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a giant room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overtures the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient method for calculating magnon-phonon coupling from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear magnon-phonon coupling hybridizes magnon and phonon bands at the same energy and momentum, resulting in an anticrossing signature.This hybrid quasiparticle benefits from a long phonon lifetime and efficient magnon transport, showing great potential for spintronics and quantum information science applications.In this paper, we present an efficient and accurate first-principles approach for calculating linear magnon-phonon couplings.We first calculate the magnon spectra from linear spin wave theory with spin Hamiltonian and first-principles exchange constants, which compared well with time-dependent density-functional theory.We then obtain the magnon-phonon coupling from the derivative of off-diagonal exchange constants in real space, calculated from the Hellmann-Feynman forces of the spin-constrained configurations, avoiding the use of cumbersome finite-difference methods.Our implementation allows calculating coupling coefficients at an arbitrary wave vector in the Brillouin zone in a single step, through Fourier interpolation of real-space supercell calculations. We verify our implementation through two-dimensional magnetic systems, monolayer $\mathrm{CrI_3}$, in agreement with experiments, and extend its application to monolayer $\mathrm{CrTe_2}$. We emphasize the role of nonmagnetic atoms in superexchange interactions and magnon-phonon coupling, which have been overlooked previously. We suggest effective tuning of magnon-phonon coupling through strain, doping, and terahertz excitations, for spintronics and quantum magnonics applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal and dimensional stability of photocatalytic material ZnPS$_3$ under extreme environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc phosphorus trisulfide (ZnPS$_3$), a promising material for photocatalysis and energy storage, is shown in this study to exhibit remarkable stability under extreme conditions. We explore its optical and structural properties under high pressure and cryogenic temperatures using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and density functional theory (DFT). Our results identify a pressure-induced phase transition starting at 6.75 GPa and stabilizing by 12.5 GPa, after which ZnPS$_3$ demonstrates robust stability across a broad pressure range of 15 to 100 GPa. DFT calculations predict a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition at 100 GPa, while PL measurements reveal defect-assisted emissions that quench under pressure due to enhanced non-radiative recombination. At cryogenic temperatures, PL quenching intensifies as non-radiative processes dominate, driven by a rising Gr\"uneisen parameter and reduced phonon population. Cryogenic X-ray diffraction (XRD) also reveals a high mean thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of (4.369 $\pm$ 0.393) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$, among the highest reported for 2D materials. This unique combination of tunable electronic properties under low pressure and high thermal sensitivity makes ZnPS$_3$ a strong candidate for sensing applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Integrating Deep-Learning-Based Magnetic Model and Non-Collinear Spin-Constrained Method: Methodology, Implementation and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-collinear spin-constrained method that generates training data for deep-learning-based magnetic model, which provides a powerful tool for studying complex magnetic phenomena at the atomic scale. First, we propose a projection method for atomic magnetic moments by applying a radial truncation to the numerical atomic orbitals. We then implement a Lagrange multiplier method that can yield the magnetic torques of atoms by constraining the magnitude and direction of atomic magnetic moments. The method is implemented in ABACUS with both plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbital basis. We benchmark the iron (Fe) systems with the new method and analyze differences from calculations with the plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbitals basis in describing magnetic energy barriers. Based on more than 30,000 first-principles data with the information of magnetic torque, we train a deep-learning-based magnetic model DeePSPIN for the Fe system. By utilizing the model in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we successfully predict Curie temperatures of $\alpha$-Fe close to experimental values.</description>

      <title>Efficiently charting the space of mixed vacancy-ordered perovskites by machine-learning encoded atomic-site information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs) are promising alternatives to three-dimensional lead halide perovskites for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Mixing these materials creates a vast compositional space, allowing for highly tunable electronic and optical properties. However, the extensive chemical landscape poses significant challenges in efficiently screening candidates with target properties. In this study, we illustrate the diversity of electronic and optical characteristics as well as the nonlinear mixing effects on electronic structures within mixed VODPs. For mixed systems with limited local environment options, the information regarding atomic-site occupation in-principle determines both structural configurations and all essential properties. Building upon this concept, we have developed a model that integrates a data-augmentation scheme with a transformer-inspired graph neural network (GNN), which encodes atomic-site information from mixed systems. This approach enables us to accurately predict band gaps and formation energies for test samples, achieving Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 21 meV and 3.9 meV/atom, respectively. Trained with datasets that include (up to) ternary mixed systems and supercells with less than 72 atoms, our model can be generalized to medium- and high-entropy mixed VODPs (with 4 to 6 principal mixing elements) and large supercells containing more than 200 atoms. Furthermore, our model successfully reproduces experimentally observed bandgap bowing in Sn-based mixed VODPs and reveals an unconventional mixing effect that can result in smaller band gaps compared to those found in pristine systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular origins of colossal barocaloric effects in plastic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, orientationally disordered crystals, or plastic crystals, have transformed the field of solid-state cooling due to the significant latent heat and entropy changes associated with their temperature induced molecular order-disorder phase transition, which can produce colossal caloric effects under external field stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these huge caloric effects remain inadequately understood, and general principles for enhancing the performance of caloric plastic crystals are lacking. Previous studies have predominantly focused on molecular rotations, overlooking other potentially critical factors, such as lattice vibrations and molecular conformations. In this study, we employ classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to both replicate and elucidate the microscopic origins of the experimentally observed colossal barocaloric (BC) effects -- those driven by hydrostatic pressure -- in the archetypal plastic crystal neopentyl glycol (NPG). Our MD simulations demonstrate that in NPG, the combined BC response and phase-transition entropy changes arising from lattice vibrations and molecular conformations are nearly equal to those from molecular reorientations, contributing 45% and 55%, respectively. These findings suggest that, alongside hydrogen bonding -- which directly impacts molecular rotational dynamics -- lattice vibrational and molecular structural features, often overlooked, must be integrated into the rational design and modeling of advanced caloric plastic crystals. These insights are not only of significant fundamental interest but also essential for driving the development of next-generation solid-state refrigeration technologies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and crystal electric field studies of two Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the low-temperature magnetic properties of two Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice compounds NaSrYb(BO$_3$)$_2$ and K$_3$YbSi$_2$O$_7$ via thermodynamic measurements followed by crystal electric field (CEF) calculations. Magnetization and specific heat data as well as the CEF energy levels confirm that the ground state is characterized by the low-lying Kramers' doublet of Yb$^{3+}$ with effective spin-1/2 ($J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$). A small Curie-Weiss temperature and scaling of magnetic isotherms corroborate very weak magnetic correlations among $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ spins. The crystal field parameters are calculated using the point charge model and the CEF Hamiltonian is determined for both the compounds. The simulation using the eigenvalues of the CEF Hamiltonian reproduces the experimental susceptibility, magnetic isotherm, and magnetic specific heat data very well. The large separation between the ground state and first excited state doublets implies that the ground state is a Kramers' doublet with $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ at low temperatures, endorsing the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>New phase space of hardness materials and synergic enhancement of hardness and toughness in superconducting Ti2Co and Ti4Co2X (X = B, C, N, O)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to traditional superhard materials with high electron density and strong covalent bonds, alloy materials mainly composed of metallic bonding structures typically have great toughness and lower hardness. Breaking through the limits of alloy materials is a preface and long term topic, which is of great significance and value for improving the comprehensive mechanical properties of alloy materials. Here, we report on the discovery of a cubic alloy semiconducting material Ti2Co with large Vickers of hardness Hvexp = 6.7 GPa and low fracture toughness of KICexp =1.51 MPa m0.5. Unexpectedly, the former value is nearly triple of the Hvcal = 2.66 GPa predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the latter value is about one or two orders of magnitude smaller than that of ordinary titanium alloy materials (KICexp = 30-120 MPa m0.5).These specifications place Ti2Co far from the phase space of the known alloy materials, but close to medium hardness materials such as MgO or TiO2. Upon incorporation of oxygen into structural void positions, both values were simultaneously improved for Ti4Co2O to = 9.7 GPa and 2.19 MPa m0.5, respectively. Further DFT calculations on the electron localization function of Ti4Co2X (X = B, C, N, O) vs. the interstitial elements indicate that these simultaneous improvements originate from the coexistence of Ti-Co metallic bonds, the emergence of newly oriented Ti-X covalent bonds, and the increase of electron concentration. Moreover, the large difference between Hvexp and Hvcal of Ti2Co suggests underlying mechanism concerning the absence of the O(16d) or Ti2-O bonds in the O-(Ti2)6 octahedron.Our discovery expands the phase space of alloy materials and illuminates the path of exploring superconducting materials with excellent mechanical performances.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-induced second-harmonic generation in quantum paraelectrics: hot-phonon effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent terahertz-pump second-harmonic-generation(SHG)-probe measurements of quantum paraelectrics observed a significant long-lived non-oscillatory SHG component following an ultrafast resonant excitation of the soft mode, which was interpreted as a signature of terahertz-induced transient ferroelectric order. Here we propose a temperature-dependent dynamic model incorporating the hot-phonon effect to simulate the soft-mode behaviors under ultrafast terahertz excitation. Its application to paraelectric KTaO3 produces quantitatively most of the features exhibited in our time-resolved SHG measurements and those in existing literature, including a long-lived non-oscillatory SHG response, SHG oscillations at twice the soft-mode frequency, SHG dampings as well as temperature and field-strength dependencies. We conclude that the observed terahertz-induced non-oscillatory SHG response in quantum paraelectrics is a consequence of the induced nonequilibrium hot-phonon effect, offering an alternative to its existing interpretation as a signature of transient ferroelectric order.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical Processing of Pure Magnesium: Hot Extrusion, Hot Rolling and Cold Drawing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study on thermomechanical processing of pure Mg was conducted through sequential hot extrusion, hot rolling, and cold drawing operations. Three different extrusion ratios (6:1, 25:1, and 39:1) were investigated at 350{\deg}C, revealing that 39:1 ratio produced an optimal bimodal grain structure with beneficial twin morphology. Subsequently, hot rolling experiments were performed at varying linear speeds (26- and 130-mm s-1) and interpass annealing times (2.5 and 10 minutes). Results demonstrated that higher rolling speeds led to finer microstructure, while longer interpass annealing times resulted in reduced twin fraction and more inhomogeneous microstructure. The processed material was then subjected to cold drawing with approximately 12% true strain per pass. Different annealing conditions (275{\deg}C and 375{\deg}C for 2.5-10 minutes) between drawing passes were evaluated. Analysis showed that annealing at 375{\deg}C for 2.5-5 minutes provided optimal softening for subsequent deformation. Fracture analysis revealed a mixed ductile-brittle behavior, with twin-matrix interfaces serving as preferred crack propagation paths This study establishes optimal processing parameters for pure Mg wire production, highlighting the critical role of twin characteristics and restoration processes in determining material formability during multi-step thermomechanical processing.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy with Adaptive Physics Informed Deep Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed deep learning framework to address common limitations in Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), such as diffraction limited resolution, noise, and undersampling due to low laser power conditions. The optical system's point spread function (PSF) and common CLSM image degradation mechanisms namely photon shot noise, dark current noise, motion blur, speckle noise, and undersampling were modeled and were directly included into model architecture. The model reconstructs high fidelity images from heavily noisy inputs by using convolutional and transposed convolutional layers. Following the advances in compressed sensing, our approach significantly reduces data acquisition requirements without compromising image resolution. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on simulated CLSM images of diverse structures, including lipid droplets, neuronal networks, and fibrillar systems. Comparisons with traditional deconvolution algorithms such as Richardson-Lucy (RL), non-negative least squares (NNLS), and other methods like Total Variation (TV) regularization, Wiener filtering, and Wavelet denoising demonstrate the superiority of the network in restoring fine structural details with high fidelity. Assessment metrics like Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), underlines that the AdaptivePhysicsAutoencoder achieved robust image enhancement across diverse CLSM conditions, helping faster acquisition, reduced photodamage, and reliable performance in low light and sparse sampling scenarios holding promise for applications in live cell imaging, dynamic biological studies, and high throughput material characterization.</description>

      <title>Large Negative Magnetoresistance in Antiferromagnetic Gd2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth chalcogenides provide a great platform to study exotic quantum phenomena such as superconductivity and charge density waves. Among various interesting properties, the coupling between magnetism and electronic transport has attracted significant attention. Here, we report the investigation of such coupling in {alpha}-Gd2Se3 single crystals through magnetic, calorimetric, and transport property measurements. {alpha}-Gd2Se3 is found to display an antiferromagnetic ground state below 11 K with metamagnetic spin-flop transitions. The magnetic fluctuations remain strong above the transition temperature. Transport measurements reveal an overall metallic transport behavior with a large negative magnetoresistance of ~ 65% near the magnetic transition temperature, together with positive MR near the field-induced spin-flop transitions, which can be understood in terms of the suppression of spin scattering by the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Interaction energies in nematic liquid crystal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish, as $\rho\to 0$, an asymptotic expansion for the minimal Dirichlet energy of $\mathbb S^2$-valued maps outside a finite number of three-dimensional particles of size $\rho$ with fixed centers $x_j\in\mathbb{R}^3$, under general anchoring conditions at the particle boundaries. Up to a scaling factor, this expansion is of the form \begin{align*} E_\rho = \sum_j \mu_j -4\pi\rho \sum_{i\neq j} \frac{\langle v_i,v_j\rangle}{|x_i-x_j|} +o(\rho)\,, \end{align*} where $\mu_j$ is the minimal energy after zooming in at scale $\rho$ around each particle, and $v_j\in\mathbb{R}^3$ is a torque determined by the far-field behavior of the corresponding single-particle minimizer. The above expansion highlights Coulomb-like interactions between the particle centers. This agrees with the \textit{electrostatics analogy} commonly used in the physics literature for colloid interactions in nematic liquid crystal. That analogy was pioneered by Brochard and de Gennes in 1970, based on a formal linearization argument. We obtain here for the first time a precise estimate of the energy error introduced by this linearization procedure.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale Integration of Single-Crystalline MoS$_2$ for Flexible Electronics Enabled by Oxide Dry-transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin, single-crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on sapphire substrates exhibit exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, positioning them as excellent channel materials for flexible electronics. However, conventional wet-transfer processes for integrating these materials onto flexible substrates often introduce surface contamination, significantly degrading device performance. Here, we present a wafer-scale dry-transfer technique using a high-dielectric oxide as the transfer medium, enabling the integration of 4-inch single-crystalline MoS$_2$ onto flexible substrates. This method eliminates contact with polymers or solvents, thus preserving the intrinsic electronic properties of MoS$_2$. As a result, the fabricated flexible field-effect transistor (FET) arrays exhibit remarkable performance, with a mobility of 117 cm$^2$/Vs, a subthreshold swing of 68.8 mV dec$^{-1}$, and an ultra-high current on/off ratio of $10^{12}$-values comparable to those achieved on rigid substrates. Leveraging the outstanding electrical characteristics, we demonstrated MoS$_2$-based flexible inverters operating in the subthreshold regime, achieving both a high gain of 218 and ultra-low power consumption of 1.4 pW/$\mu$m. Additionally, we integrated a flexible tactile sensing system driven by active-matrix MoS$_2$ FET arrays onto a robotic gripper, enabling real-time object identification. These findings demonstrate the simultaneous achievement of high electrical performance and flexibility, highlighting the immense potential of single-crystalline TMDC-based flexible electronics for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Unconventional Spin-Orbit Torque Efficiency: First Numerical Study on the Influence of Crystallographic Texture and Polycrystalline Effects on Low-Symmetry Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied as a key mechanism in spintronics applications. However, conventional SOT materials limit the spin polarization direction to the in-plane orientation, which is suboptimal for efficient magnetization switching. Recently, spins currents with spin polarization along multiple directions have been observed in low-symmetry materials, offering a promising energy-efficient strategy for the field-free switching of magnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the efficiency of this mechanism is highly dependent on the crystallographic texture of the SOT materials, a critical factor that, to date, has not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, we present the first comprehensive numerical investigation into the impact of both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic textures of SOT materials on the unconventional SOT generated by Dresselhaus-like and out-of-plane spin polarizations. By employing a theoretical orientation distribution function, we calculate the effective unconventional SOT values for SOT materials with tunable crystallographic texture. This analysis provides a framework for the synthesis and optimization of future low-symmetry SOT materials for the first time, which can enhance operational efficiency for spintronics applications in magnetoresistive random-access memory and spin logic devices.</description>

      <title>Prerequisite of superconductivity: SDW rather than tetragonal structure in double-layer La3Ni2O7-x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pressure-induced high-temperature superconductivity(Tc) in nickelates La3Ni2O7-x has sparked significant interest to explore its superconductivity at ambient pressure.Lan+1NinO3n+1(n=2,3)adopts an orthorhombic structure with tilted NiO6 octahedra and undergoes a spin-density-wave(SDW) transition at ambient pressure, while the octahedral tilting and the SDW are suppressed by pressure, and high pressure induces a structural transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal, and the high-Tc superconductivity is achieved in the tetragonal structure. This tetragonal structure is widely believed to be crucial for the pressure-induced superconductivity. Whether the pressure-stabilized tetragonal structure is a prerequisite for achieving nickelate superconductivity at ambient pressure is under hot debate. Here, by post-annealing of the orthorhombic La3Ni2O7-x as grown microcrystals with noticeable oxygen defects in high oxygen pressure environment, tetragonal La3Ni2O6.96 single crystals are successfully obtained at ambient pressure. In contrast to the orthorhombic La3Ni2O7-x, the tetragonal La3Ni2O7-x exhibits metallic behavior without a SDW transition at ambient pressure. Moreover, no superconductivity is observed at high pressure up to ~ 70 GPa. On the other hand, by utilizing Helium as the pressure medium, we have revisited the superconducting structure in pressurized orthorhombic La3Ni2O6.93. Our results indicate that the orthorhombic structure is quite robust against pressure, and no structural transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal happens, and the superconductivity under high pressure is achieved in orthorhombic structure rather than tetragonal structure claimed previously. All these results suggest that tetragonal structure is not prerequisite for achieving superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-x.</description>

      <title>A chemical bonding based descriptor for predicting the impact of quantum nuclear and anharmonic effects on hydrogen-based superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum nuclear effects (QNEs) can significantly alter a material's crystal structure and phonon spectra, impacting properties such as thermal conductivity and superconductivity. However, predicting a priori whether these effects will enhance or suppress superconductivity, or destabilize a structure, remains a grand challenge. Herein, we address this unresolved problem by introducing a descriptor, based upon the integrated crystal orbital bonding index (iCOBI), to predict the influence of QNEs on a crystal lattice's dynamic stability, phonon spectra and superconducting properties. We find that structures with atoms in symmetric chemical bonding environments exhibit greater resilience to structural perturbations induced by QNEs, while those with atoms in asymmetric bonding environments are more susceptible to structural alterations, resulting in enhanced superconducting critical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Ambient pressure growth of bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity over 90 K under high pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been discovered as a high temperature superconductor with Tc near 80 K above 14 GPa.[1-3] The search for nickelate superconductors with higher Tc, the preparation of high-quality single crystals, and the removal of high-pressure conditions including single crystal growth under high gas pressure and achievement of high Tc superconductivity under high pressure, are the most challenging tasks. Here, we present ambient pressure flux growth of high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals with superconductivity up to 91 K under high pressure. Single crystals of bilayer La3-xRxNi2O7-y with dimensions up to 220 um on the edge were successfully grown using flux method at atmosphere conditions. Single crystal X-ray diffraction, nuclear quadrupole resonance, energy dispersion spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements evidenced high quality of bilayer La2SmNi2O7-y single crystals in average structure and local structure. Superconductivity has been observed in high pressure resistivity measurements of annealed La2SmNi2O7-y single crystals with Tc onset up to 91 K, which is the highest among the known superconducting nickelates. Our results not only demonstrate a new and easy-to-access method for synthesizing high-quality bilayer nickelate single crystals, but also providing a direction for discovering superconducting nickelates with higher Tc.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Inversion from Small-Angle Scattering for Charged Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop Monte Carlo simulations for uniformly charged polymers and machine learning algorithm to interpret the intra-polymer structure factor of the charged polymer system, which can be obtained from small-angle scattering experiments. The polymer is modeled as a chain of fixed-length bonds, where the connected bonds are subject to bending energy, and there is also a screened Coulomb potential for charge interaction between all joints. The bending energy is determined by the intrinsic bending stiffness, and the charge interaction depends on the interaction strength and screening length. All three contribute to the stiffness of the polymer chain and lead to longer and larger polymer conformations. The screening length also introduces a second length scale for the polymer besides the bending persistence length. To obtain the inverse mapping from the structure factor to these polymer conformation and energy-related parameters, we generate a large data set of structure factors by running simulations for a wide range of polymer energy parameters. We use principal component analysis to investigate the intra-polymer structure factors and determine the feasibility of the inversion using the nearest neighbor distance. We employ Gaussian process regression to achieve the inverse mapping and extract the characteristic parameters of polymers from the structure factor with low relative error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report magnetization changes generated by an electric field in ferromagnetic Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Two classes of phenomena have been revealed. First, over a wide range of magnetic fields, the magnetoelectric signal is odd in the electric field and reversible. Employing a macroscopic spin model and atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory with Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate that the magnetoelectric response results from the inverse piezoelectric effect that changes the trigonal single-ion magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Second, in the metastable regime of ferromagnetic hystereses, the magnetoelectric effect becomes non-linear and irreversible in response to a time-dependent electric field, which can reorient the magnetization direction. Interestingly, our observations are similar to those reported for another dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor Cr$_x$(Bi$_{1-y}$Sb$_y$)$_{1-x}$Te$_3$, in which magnetization was monitored as a function of the gate electric field. Those results constitute experimental support for theories describing the effects of time-dependent perturbation upon glasses far from thermal equilibrium in terms of an enhanced effective temperature.</description>

      <title>Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic energy levels in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of the training process, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.</description>

      <title>An NV- center in magnesium oxide as a spin qubit for hybrid quantum technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent predictions suggest that oxides, such as MgO and CaO, could serve as hosts of spin defects with long coherence times and thus be promising materials for quantum applications. However, in most cases specific defects have not yet been identified. Here, by using a high-throughput first-principles framework and advanced electronic structure methods, we identify a negatively-charged complex between a nitrogen interstitial and a magnesium vacancy in MgO with favorable electronic and optical properties for hybrid quantum technologies. We show that this NV- center has stable triplet ground and excited states, with singlet shelving states enabling optical initialization and spin-dependent readout. We predict several properties, including absorption, emission, and zero-phonon line energies, as well as zero-field splitting tensor, and hyperfine interaction parameters, which can aid in the experimental identification of this defect. Our calculations show that due to a strong pseudo-Jahn Teller effect and low frequency phonon modes, the NV- center in MgO is subject to a substantial vibronic coupling. We discuss design strategies to reduce such coupling and increase the Debye-Waller factor, including the effect of strain and the localization of the defect states. We propose that the favorable properties of the NV- defect, along with the technological maturity of MgO, could enable hybrid classical-quantum applications, such as spintronic quantum sensors and single qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Low temperature state in strontium titanate microcrystals using in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heat maps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.</description>

Abstract: The tuning of the Fermi level in tin telluride, a topological crystalline insulator, is essential for accessing its unique surface states and optimizing its electronic properties for applications such as spintronics and quantum computing. In this study, we demonstrate that the Fermi level in tin telluride can be effectively modulated by controlling the tin concentration during chemical vapor deposition synthesis. By introducing tin-rich conditions, we observed a blue shift in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy core-level peaks of both tin and tellurium, indicating an upward shift in the Fermi level. This shift is corroborated by a decrease in work function values measured via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, confirming the suppression of Sn vacancies. Our findings provide a low-cost, scalable method to achieve tunable Fermi levels in tin telluride, offering a significant advancement in the development of materials with tailored electronic properties for next-generation technological applications.</description>

      <title>Giant Strain Tunability in Polycrystalline Ceramic Films via Helium Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful tool routinely used to control and enhance properties such as ferroelectricity, magnetic ordering, or metal-insulator transitions. Epitaxial strain in thin films allows manipulation of in-plane lattice parameters, achieving strain values generally up to 4%, and above in some specific cases. In polycrystalline films, which are more suitable for functional applications due to their lower fabrication costs, strains above 1% often cause cracking. This poses challenges for functional property tuning by strain engineering. Helium implantation has been shown to induce negative pressure through interstitial implantation, which increases the unit cell volume and allows for continuous strain tuning with the implanted dose in epitaxial monocrystalline films. However, there have been no studies on the transferability of helium implantation as a strain-engineering technique to polycrystalline films. Here, we demonstrate the technique's applicability for strain engineering beyond epitaxial monocrystalline samples. Helium implantation can trigger an unprecedented lattice parameter expansion of up to 3.2% in polycrystalline BiFeO3 films without causing structural cracks. The film maintains stable ferroelectric properties with doses up to 1E15 He/cm2. This finding underscores the potential of helium implantation in strain engineering polycrystalline materials, enabling cost-effective and versatile applications.</description>

      <title>Origin of Anomalous Hall effect in Cr-doped RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RuO$_2$ is one of the most highlighted candidates for altermagnetism. However, the most recent muon spin spectroscopy and neutron studies demonstrated the absence of magnetic order in this system. The electronic structure of RuO$_2$ hints at a possibility of realizing a magnetically ordered state upon hole doping, and such a possibility was explored experimentally in Cr-doped RuO$_2$, where it was suggested that this system exhibits the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to altermagnetism. In this manuscript, based on our density functional calculations, we revise the results obtained for this system and propose a different interpretation of experimental results. Our calculations suggest that extra holes are bound to Cr impurity and do not dope Ru bands, which remain nonmagnetic. Thus, the observed AHE is not due to the altermagnetism but stems entirely from magnetic Cr ions.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Growth and Properties of Sputter-Deposited Phase-Change Superlattice Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly textured chalcogenide films have recently gained significant interest for phase-change memory applications. Several reports have highlighted that programming efficiency improves in devices featuring superlattice stacks, such as Ge2Sb2Te5/Sb2Te3. However, to be technologically relevant, these films must be deposited on foundry-scale wafers using processes compatible with back end of the line (BEOL) integration and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as, for example, sputter deposition. In this work, we present our observations on the influence of temperature, pressure, and seeding layer parameters on the sputter growth processes of superlattice films. By measuring various material properties, we construct a pseudo-phase diagram to illustrate the growth of both individual and superlattice films with different periodicities on technologically relevant substrates, namely SiO2 and carbon. These results provide important insights into the structure, intermixing and electro-optical properties of superlattice films,</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of amorphous ternary phase diagrams: the importance of interaction parameters</title>

Abstract: Understanding phase diagrams is essential for material selection and design, as they provide a comprehensive representation of the thermodynamics of mixtures. This work delivers a broad and systematic overview of possible ternary phase diagrams for amorphous systems representative of polymers, small organic molecules, and solvents. Thanks to computationally efficient methods, an unprecedented library of $&gt;$80,000 ternary phase diagrams is generated based on a systematic screening of interaction parameters. Twenty-one phase diagram types, including unreported ones, are identified. They are classified according to simple rules related to the number of immiscible material pairs, of miscibility gaps, and of three-phase regions. They are mapped onto the three-dimensional interaction parameters space, providing a clear picture of their likelihood and existence conditions. Four well-known phase-diagram types with 0, 1, 2, or 3 immiscible pairs are found to be the most likely. The numerous uncommon phase diagrams are mostly observed within a small parameter window around the critical interaction parameter values. For the most common phase diagram types, we show that the size of the processability window becomes sensitive to interaction parameter variations close to critical values. The sensitivity decreases for materials with increasing molar size. Finally, successful comparisons of simulated and experimental phase diagrams showcase the real-world relevance of this theoretical analysis. The presented results lay a robust foundation for rational design of solution processing conditions and for blend morphology control. Immediate applications include organic thin films and the identification of green solvents for sustainable processing.</description>

      <title>Interactive Multiscale Modeling to Bridge Atomic Properties and Electrochemical Performance in Li-CO$_2$ Battery Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their performance relies on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with a Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form toroidal and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be significantly improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.</description>

      <title>Structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu compounds characterized by a neural-network-based potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tungsten-copper (W-Cu) compounds are widely utilized in various industrial fields due to their exceptional mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a neural-network-based deep potential (DP) model that covers a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 0 to 3,000 K, and pressures, varying from 0 to 10 GPa. This study presents a model trained using density functional theory data for full concentration CuxW100-x compounds. Through this model, we systematically investigate the structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu alloys and have the following findings. First, the bulk modulus (B) and Young's modulus (E) of W-Cu alloys exhibit a linear decline as the Cu content increases, indicating a softening trend in the CuxW100-x compounds as the Cu concentration rises. Second, a higher Cu content results in higher critical strain and lower critical stress for these compounds. A brittle-to-ductile transition in the deformation mode predicted is predicted at around 37.5 at. % Cu content. Third, tensile loading tests in the W-Cu gradient structure reveal that Cu-poor region serves as a barrier, hindering shear band propagation while promoting new shear band formation in the Cu-rich region. The above results from the DP model are anticipated to aid in exploring the physical mechanisms underlying the complex phenomena of W-Cu systems and contribute to the advancement of methodologies for materials simulation.</description>

Abstract: Exploring new unconventional superconductors is of great value for both fundamental research and practical applications. It is a long-term challenge to develop and study more hole-doped superconductors in 1111 system of iron-based superconductors. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity with a critical transition temperature up to 30.7 K in the compound CaFeAsF by a post-annealing treatment in air atmosphere. The superconducting behaviors are verified in both the single-crystalline and polycrystalline samples by the resistance and magnetization measurements. The analysis by combining the depth-resolved time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements shows that the introduction of oxygen elements and the consequent changing in Fe valence by the annealing treatment may lead to the hole-type doping, which is the origin for the occurrence of superconductivity. Our results pave the way for further in-depth investigations on the hole-doped 1111 system in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electric-field switchable chirality in rhombohedral graphene Chern insulators stabilized by tungsten diselenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chern insulators host topologically protected chiral edge currents with quantized conductance characterized by their Chern number. Switching the chirality of a Chern insulator, namely, the direction of the edge current, is highly challenging due to topologically forbidden backscattering but is of considerable importance for the design of topological devices. Nevertheless, this can be achieved by reversing the sign of the Chern number through a topological phase transition. Here, we report electrically switchable chirality in rhombohedral multilayer graphene-based Chern insulators. By introducing moire superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observed a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moire band with the Chern number tunable from -1, 1 to 2. Furthermore, integrating monolayer tungsten diselenide at the moireless interface of rhombohedral decalayer graphene/h-BN superlattices stabilizes the Chern insulators, enabling quantized anomalous Hall resistance of h/2e^2. Remarkably, the Chern number can be switched from -1 to 2 using displacement fields. Our work establishes rhombohedral multilayer graphene moire superlattices as a versatile platform for topological engineering, with switchable chirality offering significant promise for integrating chiral edge currents into topological electronic circuits.</description>

      <title>Elastic softness of low-symmetry frustrated $A$Ti$_2$O$_5$ ($A$ = Co, Fe)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthorhombic pseudobrookites CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ have a low-symmetry crystal structure comprising magnetic Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions and nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ ions, where the orbital-nondegenerate Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions form one-dimensional chains running along the orthorhombic $a$ axis. These compounds undergo an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \sim$ 26 K for CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and $T_N \sim$ 40 K for FeTi$_2$O$_5$. Ultrasound velocity measurements on single crystals of CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ reveal that CoTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits unusual elastic softness above $T_N$ in the symmetry-lowering elastic mode of $ac$-plane shear elastic modulus, inconsistent with the structural symmetry breaking caused by antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$. This suggests the presence of two distinct types of magnetostructural fluctuations above $T_N$ that should be a precursor to the symmetry-lowering lattice distortion at $T_N$. In contrast, FeTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits either negligible or smaller elastic softness, indicating weaker spin-lattice coupling. These findings highlight CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ as unique spin-latticed-coupled frustrated systems with low crystal symmetry, where, while the exchange interactions are quasi-one-dimensional in nature, the frustration is released by further lowering the crystal symmetry through three-dimensional spin-lattice coupling, which is stronger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics, fundamentally shaping the behavior of electronic systems and inducing the emergence of novel phenomena. The Hall effect, a key concept in this field, demonstrates how symmetry breaking, particularly of time-reversal symmetry, influences electronic transport properties. Recently, the nonlinear Hall effect has extended this understanding by generating a transverse voltage that modulates at twice the frequency of the driving alternating current without breaking time-reversal symmetry. This effect is closely tied to the symmetry and quantum geometric properties of materials, offering a new approach to probing the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Here, we provide a review of the theoretical insights and experimental advancements in the nonlinear Hall effect, particularly focusing on its realization in two-dimensional materials. We discuss the challenges still ahead, look at potential applications for devices, and explore how these ideas might apply to other nonlinear transport phenomena. By elucidating these aspects, this review aims to advance the understanding of nonlinear transport effects and their broader implications for future technologies.</description>

      <title>Emittance Minimization for Aberration Correction II: Physics-informed Bayesian Optimization of an Electron Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-{\AA}ngstr\"om probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Magnetic measurements under high pressure with a quantum sensor in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic measurements under high-pressure conditions are pivotal for the study of superconductivity and magnetic materials but remain challenging due to the micrometer-sized sample in diamond anvil cells (DAC). In this study, we propose a quantum sensing approach utilizing negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_B^-$) spin defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride for high resolution magnetic measurements under pressure. The optical and spin properties of VB$^-$ defects were systematically studied under high-pressure conditions, revealing a significant pressure-induced shift in zero-field splitting (ZFS), approximately three times larger than that of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pressure-dependent magnetic transition and variations in the Curie temperature of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flake using V$_B^-$ defects under pressures. Notably, the maximum operational pressure for V$_B^-$ defects was determined to be approximately 11 GPa, attributed to a structural phase transition in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This work establishes the way for two-dimensional quantum sensing technologies under high-pressure environments.</description>
