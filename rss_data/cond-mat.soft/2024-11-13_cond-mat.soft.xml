      <title>Rubber wear: experiment and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the wear rate (mass loss per unit sliding distance) of a tire tread rubber compound sliding on concrete paver surfaces under dry and wet conditions, at different nominal contact pressures of $\sigma_0 = 0.12$, $0.29$, and $0.43 \ {\rm MPa}$, and sliding velocities ranging from $v= 1 \ {\rm \mu m/s}$ to $1 \ {\rm cm/s}$. We find that the wear rate is proportional to the normal force and remains independent of the sliding speed. Sliding in water and soapy water results in significantly lower wear rates compared to dry conditions. The experimental data are analyzed using a theory that predicts wear rates and wear particle size distributions consistent with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>A Composite Hydrogel of Porous Gold Nanorods and Gelatin: Nanoscale Structure and Rheo-Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating nanomaterials into hydrogels allows for the creation of versatile materials with properties that can be precisely tailored by manipulating their nanoscale structures, leading to a wide range of bulk properties. Investigating the structural and property characteristics of composite hydrogels is crucial in tailoring their performance for specific applications. This study focuses on investigating the correlation between the structural arrangement and properties of a composite hydrogel of thermoresponsive polymer, gelatin, and light-responsive antimicrobial porous gold nanorods, $PAuNR$. The rheo-mechanical properties of the composite hydrogels are correlated with their nanoscale structural characteristics, investigated using small-angle neutron scattering ($SANS$). Analysis of $SANS$ data reveals a decrease in the fractal dimension of $PAuNRs$ incorporated hydrogel matrix, as compared to pure gelatin. Incorporating $PAuNRs$ results in formation of softer composite hydrogel as evident from decrease in viscoelastic moduli, critical yield strain, denaturation temperature and swelling ratio. Our results demonstrates that the structural modulation at the nanoscale can be precisely controlled through adjusting $PAuNRs$ concentration and temperature providing an fabrication mechanism for hydrogels with desired elastic properties. The reduced elasticity of the composite hydrogel and light sensitive/antimicrobial property of the $PAuNRs$ makes this system suitable for specific biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, device fabrication and stimuli based controlled drug delivery devices respectively.</description>

      <title>Modelling viscoelastic adhesion and friction in sliding contact mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our recent study on rough adhesive contacts of viscoelastic materials in steady-state sliding, focusing on the interplay between adhesion and viscoelasticity by means of a novel energy approach. We investigate tribological features over a wide range of velocity values, exploring the effect of small- and large- scale viscoelasticity on the overall contact behavior. The former is associated with viscoelastic dissipation close to the adhesive neck at the contact edges; the latter refers to material hysteresis involving the entire bulk of the solid. Depending on the sliding velocity, we predict highly enhanced adhesive strength compared to the purely elastic conditions, increased friction compared to the adhesiveless case, and non-monotonic trend of the energy release rates at the contact leading and trailing edges. Most of our results are supported by existing experiments.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of poly(ethylene oxide)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poly(ethylene oxide) is an important polymer with many applications, e.g., as solid-state electrolyte in batteries. Its relaxation dynamics, characterizing its molecular and submolecular motions, which is relevant for many of these applications, was investigated numerous times, mostly employing dielectric spectroscopy. However, the various dynamic processes revealed by these studies were interpreted in conflicting ways and even their nomenclature in literature is highly inconsistent. Here we present the results of a detailed investigation of this polymer employing dielectric spectroscopy covering a relatively broad frequency and temperature range. We clearly detect four intrinsic relaxation processes. The slowest one most likely represents a so-called normal mode, reflecting global motions of the polymer chains, an interpretation that was not considered in previous works. The second process can be unequivocally identified with the segmental alpha relaxation, which governs glassy freezing and the glass transition. The third, only rarely detected process corresponds to the Johari-Goldstein relaxation of poly(ethylene oxide), widely overlooked in previous studies. The fourth and fastest process is unrelated to the supercooled and glassy state of this polymer and probably due to local, intramolecular motions.</description>

      <title>Rate- and temperature-dependent strain hardening in glassy polymers: Micromechanisms and constitutive modeling based on molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform molecular dynamics simulations under uniaxial tension to investigate the micromechanisms underlying strain hardening in glassy polymers. By decomposing the stress into virial components associated with pair, bond, and angle interactions, we identify the primary contributors to strain hardening as the stretching of polymer bonds. Interestingly, rather than the average bond stretch, we find that the key contributions to stress response come from a subset of bonds at the upper tail of the stretch distribution. Our results demonstrate that the stress in the hardening region can be correlated with the average stretch of the most extended bonds in each polymer chain, independent of temperatures and strain rates. These bonds, which we denote as load-bearing bonds, allow us to define a local load-bearing deformation gradient in continuum mechanics that captures their contribution to the hardening stress tensor. Building on this insight, we incorporate the load-bearing mechanism into a constitutive framework with orientation-induced back stress, developing a model that accurately reproduces the stress response of the molecular systems over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates in their glassy state.</description>

      <title>$NVU$ view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems exhibit strikingly invariant structure and dynamics when energy polydispersity is introduced [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by energy polydispersity, which is in contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue - and validate by simulations of up to 30% polydispersity - that this invariance reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. $NVU$ dynamics is defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy; because this dynamics is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same structure and dynamics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as for the single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is shown to be significantly affected by the introduction of size polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Transparent and Electrically Switchable Thin Film Tactile Actuators Based on Molecular Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most tactile actuators create tactile sensations through vibrations or the mechanical and electrochemical formation of bumps. However, tactile sensations of real objects arise from friction which is derived not only from physical topography, but also surface chemistry. Here, we show that molecular rearrangement can be leveraged to create new classes of tactile actuators based on the phases of liquid crystals embedded in a solid and transparent polymer film. We found that humans can feel differences by touch, especially between planar alignment and its disrupted phase, as actuated by a DC electrical field. In subjective terms, the sensation was described as a tacky to polished-like feeling. We attribute the mechanism of tactile contrast to microscale phase separation and changes in molecular orientation, as the nanoscale differences in topography are too small to be detected on their own by humans. This molecular rearrangement occurs quicker (&lt;17 ms) than actuation through ionic or fluid movement. This enables a new class of tactile actuators based on molecular orientation (TAMO) for haptic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium phase transitions in hybrid Voronoi models of cell colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a stiff nucleus whose effect in modeling the collective behavior of cell aggregates is usually underestimated. However, increasing experimental evidence links nuclear modifications with phenotypic transition, like the one between epithelial and mesenchymal states. In this work, we explore the effect of short-range repulsive forces in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the self-propelled Voronoi model. We show that the competition between steric repulsions (representing nuclear/cellular compressibility) and Vertex interactions (mimicking cell-cell adhesion/interaction and cytoskeleton organization) generate a variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions from Motility-Induced Phase Separation to mesenchymal-like phases up to disordered confluent configurations. Notably, we found that tuning the nucleus's effective size/compressibility provides an additional way to cross the boundary between the different possible phases in line with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Wetting, Algebraic Curves and Conformal Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of wetting in a two-component square-gradient model of interfaces in a fluid mixture, showing three-phase bulk coexistence, have revealed some highly surprising features. Numerical results show that the density profile paths, which form a tricuspid shape in the density plane, have curious geometric properties, while conjectures for the analytical form of the surface tensions imply that nonwetting may persist up to the critical end points, contrary to the usual expectation of critical point wetting. Here, we solve the model exactly and show that the profile paths are conformally invariant quartic algebraic curves that change genus at the wetting transition. Being harmonic, the profile paths can be represented by an analytic function in the complex plane which then conformally maps the paths onto straight lines. Using this, we derive the conjectured form of the surface tensions and explain the geometrical properties of the tricuspid and its relation to the Neumann triangle for the contact angles. The exact solution confirms that critical point wetting is absent in this square-gradient model.</description>

      <title>Generating forces in confinement via polymerization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how to produce forces using biomolecular building blocks is essential for the development of adaptive synthetic cells and living materials. Here we ask whether a dynamic polymer system can generate deformation forces in soft compartments by pure self-assembly, motivated by the fact that biological polymer networks like the cytoskeleton can exert forces, move objects, and deform membranes by simply growing, even in the absence of molecular motors. We address this question by investigating polymer force generation by varying the release rate, the structure, and the interactions of self-assembling monomers. First, we develop a toy computational model of polymerization in a soft elastic shell that reveals the emergence of spontaneous bundling which enhances shell deformation. We then extend our model to account more explicitly for monomer binding dynamics. We find that the rate at which monomers are released into the interior of the shell is a crucial parameter for achieving deformation through polymer growth. Finally, we demonstrate that the introduction of multivalent particles that can join polymers can either improve or impede polymer performance, depending on the amount and on the structure of the multivalent particles. Our results provide guidance for the experimental realization of polymer systems that can perform work at the nanoscale, for example through rationally designed self-assembling proteins or nucleic acids.</description>

      <title>Selecting Relevant Structural Features for Glassy Dynamics by Information Imbalance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the identification of relevant structural features that contribute to the dynamical heterogeneity in a model glass-forming liquid. By employing the recently proposed information imbalance technique, we select these features from a range of physically motivated descriptors. This selection process is performed in a supervised manner (using both dynamical and structural data) and an unsupervised manner (using only structural data). We then apply the selected features to predict future dynamics using a machine learning technique. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this approach in identifying the dominant mechanisms governing the glassy slow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimal design accelerates discovery of material properties from bubble dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optimal sequential experimental design approach is developed to computationally characterize soft material properties at the high strain rates associated with bubble cavitation. The approach involves optimal design and model inference. The optimal design strategy maximizes the expected information gain in a Bayesian statistical setting to design experiments that provide the most informative cavitation data about unknown soft material properties. We infer constitutive models by characterizing the associated viscoelastic properties from measurements via a hybrid ensemble-based 4D-Var method (En4D-Var). The inertial microcavitation-based high strain-rate rheometry (IMR) method ([1]) simulates the bubble dynamics under laser-induced cavitation. We use experimental measurements to create synthetic data representing the viscoelastic behavior of stiff and soft polyacrylamide hydrogels under realistic uncertainties. The synthetic data are seeded with larger errors than state-of-the-art measurements yet match known material properties, reaching 1% relative error within 10 sequential designs (experiments). We discern between two seemingly equally plausible constitutive models, Neo-Hookean Kelvin--Voigt and quadratic Kelvin--Voigt, with a probability of correctness larger than 99% in the same number of experiments. This strategy discovers soft material properties, including discriminating between constitutive models and discerning their parameters, using only a few experiments.</description>

      <title>Transient Elasticity -- A Unifying Framework for Thixotropy, Polymers, and Granular Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Having the elastic strain relax while observing energy conservation and entropy production yields a model called hydrodynamics of transient elasticity (HoTE). It interpolates between solid- and fluid-dynamics and provides a broad framework for many systems such as polymers, granular media, thixotropic and yield-stress fluids. Focusing on the last two systems, this paper shows that, with little efforts at model sculpting, HoTE easily accounts for many effects, including: static and dynamic yield stress, over- and under-shoot of stresses at rate jumps, hysteresis at rate ramps and rate inversion, "viscosity bifurcation", acceleration on a tilted plane, shear band, elastic shear waves, aging and rejuvenation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete numerical method based on the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) approach to simulate two-fluid Hele-Shaw flow subject to the Saffman-Taylor interfacial instability, in the case where the displaced fluid is non-Newtonian. Focusing on fluids for which the most relevant non-Newtonian aspect of the thin-gap flow is shear-thinning, we introduce a history-dependent aspect into the algorithm, modeling shear-rate-dependent fluid viscosity. The main finding is that the morphology of the emerging patterns, characterized by the fractal dimension, is modified in a nontrivial manner by the shear-thinning nature of the displaced fluid. In particular, we consistently find that shear-thinning leads to the formation of patterns characterized by a smaller fractal dimension, compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and global order controls bifurcations in nonreciprocal systems without a conservation law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in the short-range interacting nonreciprocal Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Long-lived states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady states via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in nonreciprocal matter without conservation laws.</description>
