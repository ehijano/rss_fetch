      <title>Learning noisy tissue dynamics across time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from wound healing to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. This machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train it compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional formulation of curved nematic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In soft matter, the phase of nematic liquid crystals can be made from anisotropic molecules in single component materials, or as a suspension of mesoscopic nematogens. The later offers more versatility in the experimental design of complex shapes, in particular thin curved shells, and is often found in biological systems at multiple scales from cells to tissues. Here, we investigate theoretically the transition from three-dimensional nematics to a two-dimensional description restricted to a tangent plane, using a mean-field approach. We identify a transition from first to second order isotropic-nematic transition in presence of weak tangential anchoring. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a two-dimensional description of thin nematic shells is relevant. Nonetheless, using the example of active nematic stress, we identify physical differences between two- and three-dimensional descriptions in curved geometry. Finally, we construct a thin film approximation of nematohydrodynamics for a nematic shell in contact with a curved substrate. All together, those results show that a tangential restriction of nematic orientation must be used with care in presence of curvature, activity, or weak anchoring boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Counting, Computing, and Pattern Recognition with Self-Assembling Non-Reciprocal DNA Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the intrinsic dynamics of physical systems for information processing opens new avenues for computation embodied in matter. Using simulations of a model system, we show that assemblies of DNA tiles capable of self-organizing into multiple target structures can perform basic computational tasks analogous to those of finite-state automata when equipped with programmable non-reciprocal interactions that drive controlled dynamical transitions between these structures. By establishing design rules for multifarious self-assembly while budgeting the energy input required to drive these non-equilibrium transitions, we demonstrate that these systems can execute a wide variety of tasks including counting, computing modulo functions, and recognizing specific input patterns. This framework integrates memory, sensing, and actuation within a single physical platform, paving the way toward energy-efficient physical computation embedded in materials ranging from DNA and enzymes to proteins and colloids.</description>

      <title>Flexel ecosystem: simulating mechanical systems from entities with arbitrarily complex mechanical responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearities and instabilities in mechanical structures have shown great promise for embedding advanced functionalities. However, simulating structures subject to nonlinearities can be challenging due to the complexity of their behavior, such as large shape changes, effect of pre-tension, negative stiffness and instabilities. While traditional finite element analysis is capable of simulating a specific nonlinear structure quantitatively, it can be costly and cumbersome to use due to the high number of degrees of freedom involved. We propose a framework to facilitate the exploration of highly nonlinear structures under quasistatic conditions. In our framework, models are simplified by introducing `flexels', elements capable of intrinsically representing the complex mechanical responses of compound structures. By extending the concept of nonlinear springs, flexels can be characterized by multi-valued response curves, and model various mechanical deformations, interactions and stimuli, e.g., stretching, bending, contact, pneumatic actuation, and cable-driven actuation. We demonstrate that the versatility of the formulation allows to model and simulate, with just a few elements, complex mechanical systems such as pre-stressed tensegrities, tape spring mechanisms, interaction of buckled beams and pneumatic soft gripper actuated using a metafluid. With the implementation of the framework in an easy-to-use Python library, we believe that the flexel formulation will provide a useful modeling approach for understanding and designing nonlinear mechanical structures.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned domain partitioning for computationally efficient coupling of continuum and particle simulations of membrane fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All simulation approaches eventually face limits in computational scalability when applied to large spatiotemporal domains. This challenge becomes especially apparent in molecular-level particle simulations, where high spatial and temporal resolution leads to rapidly increasing computational demands. To overcome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine simulations with different levels of resolution offer a promising solution. In this context, we present a machine learning-based decision model that dynamically selects between simulation methods at runtime. The model is built around a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) that predicts the expected discrepancy between particle and continuum simulation results, enabling the localized use of high-fidelity particle simulations only where they are expected to add value. This concurrent approach is applied to the simulation of membrane fabrication processes, where a particle simulation is coupled with a continuum model. This article describes the architecture of the decision model and its integration into the simulation workflow, enabling efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations.</description>

      <title>From Interface Dynamics to Darcy Scale Description of Multiphase Flow in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An outstanding characteristic of porous media, desired in many applications, is the large surface area, which facilitates solid-fluid interactions, making porous media an extreme case in colloid and interface science. In two-fluid systems, wetting and the balance of capillary and viscous forces control fluid displacement processes, leading to a wide range of complex flow regimes with rich spatio-temporal dynamics. Macroscopic two-phase flow is historically described through the phenomenological extensions of Darcy's law. Besides many other shortcomings and inconsistencies, it covers only connected pathway flow in the capillary-dominated flow regime in a rigorous manner while other flow regimes with moving interfaces and associated topological changes are entirely implicit. Given the lack of adequate descriptions, upscaling multiphase flow from pore to Darcy scale represents a long-standing challenge paving into the fields of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and integral geometry. In this review, we compare novel concepts which have been largely motivated by experimental insights, enabled by significant advances in pore-scale imaging and modeling over the last decade.</description>

      <title>Exact results for dissipation and steady creeping flow in three-dimensional chiral active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral active fluids consist of self-spinning particles that rotate as a result of a continuous injection of energy on the microscopic scale (e.g., by activity or an external field). The hydrodynamics of such fluids is described by antisymmetric contributions in the viscosity tensor -called odd viscosity-, which are allowed by symmetry due to the presence of a non-trivial spin angular momentum density. By generalising the Helmholtz minimum dissipation theorem to systems with odd viscosity, we show that incompressible three-dimensional odd fluids in the presence of sources that induce flow (e.g. surfaces that impose boundary conditions) admit a unique solution for their steady flow fields at low Reynolds number. Furthermore, we prove that such flows dissipate more energy than ordinary Stokes flow, provided that the flow field is affected by odd viscosity. As an example, we consider a model fluid described by one shear viscosity and one odd viscosity in the creeping flow regime. We explicitly compute the stress tensor when such a fluid is subjected to a point force density. Finally, we compute exact results for the pressure and flow fields around a translating and rotating spherical particle from their singularity representations. From these solutions and our extended Helmholtz theorem, we explain why a translating sphere dissipates more energy when odd viscosity is present, whereas a rotating sphere does not.</description>

      <title>Multi-level mechanical modeling and computational design framework for weft knitted fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a multi-level modeling and design framework for weft knitted fabrics, beginning with a volumetric finite element analysis capturing their mechanical behavior from fundamental principles. Incorporating yarn-level data, it accurately predicts stress-strain responses, reducing the need for extensive physical testing. A simplified strain energy approach homogenizes the results into three key variables, enabling rapid, accurate predictions in minutes. After validation against experiments, our framework can simulate new knit fabrics without additional tests. In real-world scenarios, fabrics often feature variations in yarn materials or patterns. The framework extends to heterogeneous fabrics, showing that transitions between distinct regions can be captured using simple mechanical analogies: springs in series and parallel. This allows heterogeneous textiles to be treated as idealized patchworks of homogeneous pieces, preserving predictive accuracy. The method is demonstrated by designing and producing a compression sleeve with uniform pressure, illustrating how the framework supports development of knits tailored to specific assistance levels and anatomical features. By combining volumetric finite element analysis, simplified model through homogenization, and controlled material transitions, this approach provides a scalable, high-fidelity path toward next-generation weft knitted fabric design.</description>

      <title>Dumbbell dimer dynamics in three-dimensional chiral fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergent orientational dynamics of a dumbbell dimer -- two asymmetric monomers connected by a linking spring -- in a three-dimensional chiral environment with odd viscosity. In classical systems with conserved parity symmetry, reciprocal oscillations of a dimer does not lead to rotational motion. Here, through an analytical calculation, we find that the presence of chirality in the system induces rotational dynamics as function of the expansion/contraction of the dimer. By incorporating thermal fluctuations, we further find that the rotational diffusivity is affected by the coupling between conformational fluctuations and rotational motion. Our results provide insights into problems where the parity symmetry is broken and can be used as a building block to study similar models at the collective level. These problems include multi-component molecular machines in odd-viscous fluids and systems with charged polymers where oddity is present through external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Effects Underlying Dynamic Heterogeneity in Miscible Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) with Poly(ethylene oxide)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Although often attributed to differences in the intrinsic dynamics of each component, the molecular origin of their coupling and its dependencies remain unclear. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of polyethylene oxide (PEO)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends, across the full range of compositions and multiple thermal regimes, to characterize local fluctuations and sub-chain relaxations for both PEO and PMMA. By constructing probability distributions of local composition and computing entropic measures, we connect nanoscale heterogeneity to differences in mobility between PEO and PMMA, extending beyond mean-field treatments. While PMMA segmental fluctuations in blends broadly align with $T_\text{g}$-equivalent neat PMMA systems, PEO exhibits enhanced mobility correlated with increased free volume and broader, more diverse local compositions upon blending. Rouse-mode analysis, used to probe relaxation dynamics over different length scales, shows that PEO relaxation approaches neat-like behavior in PEO-rich domains, whereas PMMA relaxation accelerates uniformly across all mode numbers. Given the local mobility enhancement of PMMA by PEO, this uniform shift suggests a nanoscale facilitation process that extends PEO's influence beyond its immediate environment. These findings link the statistics of local compositional heterogeneity to dynamic asymmetry across length scales, provide physical insight into the behavior of this archetypal blend system, and establish a framework for analyzing dynamic coupling in others.</description>

      <title>Granular jamming and rheology in microgravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how granular materials behave in low gravity is crucial for planetary science and space exploration. It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>Machine learning many-body potentials for charged colloids in primitive 1:1 electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective interactions between charged particles dispersed in an electrolyte are most commonly modeled using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential, where the ions in the suspension are coarse-grained out at mean-field level. However, several experiments point to shortcomings of this theory, as the distribution of ions surrounding colloids is governed by nontrivial correlations in regimes of strong Coulomb coupling (e.g. low temperature, low dielectric constant, high ion valency, high surface charge). Insight can be gained by explicitly including the ions in simulations of these colloidal suspensions, even though direct simulations of dispersions of highly charged spheres are computationally demanding. To circumvent slow equilibration, we employ a machine-learning (ML) framework to generate density-dependent ML potentials that accurately describe the effective colloid interactions at given system parameters. These ML potentials enable fast simulations and make large-scale simulations of charged colloids in suspension possible, opening the possibility for a systematic study of their phase behaviour, in particular gas-liquid and fluid-solid coexistence.</description>
