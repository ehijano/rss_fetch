      <title>Introduction to Engineering Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This lecture presents an overview of the basic concepts and fundamentals of Engineering Materials within the framework of accelerator applications. After a short introduction, main concepts relative to the structure of matter are reviewed, like crystalline structures, defects and dislocations, phase diagrams and transformations. The microscopic description is correlated with physical properties of materials, focusing in metallurgical aspects like deformation and strengthening. Main groups of materials are addressed and described, namely, metals and alloys, ceramics, polymers, composite materials, and advanced materials, where brush-strokes of tangible applications in particle accelerators and detectors are given. Deterioration aspects of materials are also presented, like corrosion in metals and degradation in plastics.</description>

      <title>Three Dimensional Theory of the Ion Channel Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ion channel laser (ICL) is a plasma-based alternative to the free electron laser (FEL) that uses the electric field of a uniform-density ion channel rather than the magnetic field of an undulator to induce transverse oscillations of a relativistic electron bunch and thereby produce coherent radiation via a collective electromagnetic instability. The powerful focusing of the ion channel generally yields significantly higher gain parameters in the ICL as compared to the FEL. This permits lasing in extremely short distances using electron bunches with an energy spread as large as a few percent; a value readily achievable with current plasma-based accelerators. ICLs, however, impose stringent transverse phase space requirements on the electron beam beyond what is required in FELs. In this work, we present a novel 3D theory of the off-axis planar ICL that accounts for a number of effects including diffraction, transverse guided mode shape, frequency and betatron phase detuning, and nonzero spread in energy and undulator parameter. We derive the ICL pendulum and field equations, which we use to write down the 3D Maxwell-Klimontovich equations. After linearizing, we obtain an integro-differential equation describing the $z$-evolution of the radiation mode. The 3D ICL dispersion relation is obtained using a Van Kampen normal mode expansion. We numerically solve the $z$-evolution equation to compute radiation power growth rates and transverse guided mode profiles over a range of different ICL parameters. We note the ICL's large gain bandwidth and examine the gain reduction due to 3D effects, energy spread, and emittance. Electron beam phase space and emittance requirements for lasing are derived. Finally, we make general observations about the general performance and feasibility of the ICL and discuss future prospects.</description>

      <title>First Electron Acceleration in a Tunable-Velocity Laser Wakefield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>
