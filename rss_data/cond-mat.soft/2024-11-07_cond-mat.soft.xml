      <title>Crystalline and polycrystalline regimes in a periodically sheared 2-dimensional system of disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A layer of monodisperse circular steel disks in a nearly square horizontal cell forms, for shear amplitudes SA $\le$ 0.08, hexagonal close-packed crystallites that grow and merge until a single crystal fills the container. Increasing the shear amplitude leads to another reproducible regime, 0.21 $\le$ SA $\le$ 0.27, where a few large polycrystallites grow, shrink, and rotate with shear cycling, but do not evolve into a single crystal that fills the container. These results are robust within certain ranges of applied pressure and shear frequency.</description>

      <title>Magic sizes enable minimal-complexity, high-fidelity assembly of programmable shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic methods enable designing subunits that self-assemble into structures with well-defined sizes and architectures, but yields are frequently suppressed by the formation of off-target metastable structures. Increasing the complexity (number of distinct inter-subunit interaction types) can inhibit off-target structures, but leads to slower kinetics and higher synthesis costs. Here, we use icosahedral shells formed of programmable triangular subunits as a model system, and identify design principles that produce the highest target yield at the lowest complexity. We use a symmetry-based construction to create a range of design complexities, starting from the maximal symmetry Caspar-Klug assembly up to the fully addressable, zero-symmetry assembly. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the most prominent defects leading to off-target assemblies are a class of disclinations. We derive symmetry-based rules for identifying the optimal (lowest-complexity, highest-symmetry) design that inhibits these disclinations, leading to robust, high-fidelity assembly of targets with arbitrarily large sizes. Optimal complexity varies non-monotonically with target size, with `magic' sizes appearing for high-symmetry designs in which symmetry axes do not intersect vertices of the triangular net. The optimal designs at magic sizes require $12$ times fewer inequivalent interaction-types than the (minimal symmetry) fully addressable construction.</description>

      <title>Effect of applied magnetic fields on the morphology of nematic nanobridges in slit pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we report a molecular dynamics study of the effect of the application of magnetic fields on the morphology of nematic nanobridges of 32000 oblate Gay-Berne particles in slit pores favouring homeotropic anchoring. In absence of magnetic fields, previous studies show that there are different conformations of the nanobridge, depending on the slit pore width $D$ and the wettability of the walls. Under the application of uniform magnetic field cycles, in which the intensity of the field is increased stepwise until a maximum value and then decreased at the same rate, switching between different nanobridge conformations can be observed if the magnetic field is applied in a perpendicular direction to the global nematic director of the nanobridge. However, there are situations in which the initial bridge conformation is recovered after the magnetic field application, indicating that the switching can only be observed if there are different locally stable nanobridge conformations under the same thermodynamic conditions. Moreover, magnetic fields can destabilize the nanobridge, leading to its breakdown into isolated nanodroplets attached to a single wall.</description>

      <title>Estimation of spatial and time scales of collective behaviors of active matters through learning hydrodynamic equations from particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for learning hydrodynamic equations from particle-based simulations of active matter. Our method leverages coarse-graining in both space and time to bridge microscopic particle dynamics with macroscopic continuum models. By employing spectral representations and sparse regression, we efficiently estimate partial differential equations (PDEs) that capture collective behaviors such as flocking and phase separation. This approach, validated using hydrodynamic descriptions of the Vicsek model and Active Brownian particles, demonstrates the potential of data-driven strategies to uncover the universal features of collective dynamics in active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Active magneto gyrator: Memory induced trapped diamagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically explore the dynamics of a charged active particle coupled to two thermal baths kept at two different temperatures in two dimensions. The particle is confined to an asymmetric harmonic potential and a magnetic field of constant magnitude is applied perpendicular to the plane of motion of the particle. For such a system, as opposed to Brownian gyrator, the potential asymmetry and temperature gradient are not the key factors for the gyration, as long as finite activity and magnetic field are present. The system shows only a paramagnetic behavior in the absence of either potential asymmetry or temperature gradient. However, by tuning the temperature gradient or potential asymmetry, the system as a function of the duration of activity can exhibit paramagnetic, diamagnetic, or co-existence of both the phases. Interestingly, the magnetic moment vanishes for parameters for which the system possesses a non-equilibrium steady state and hence, a magnetic transition is observed through these non-magnetic points. Further, when the system is suspended in a viscoelastic medium characterized by a finite memory, it exhibits a magnetic transition in the activity-memory parameter space through a non-magnetic line. This non-magnetic line is sensitive to temperature gradient and potential asymmetry. It interestingly forms a closed loop with a diamagnetic phase inside the loop and the entire regime outside as paramagnetic. This results in the emergence of a trapped diamagnetic phase existing only within a finite regime of activity-memory parameter space. This phase eventually disappears as the temperature gradient increases (or decreases) depending on the sign of the potential asymmetry. Moreover, it is observed that by tuning the system parameters, one can obtain zero magnetic moment even for parameter ranges that defy the equilibrium condition of the system.</description>

      <title>Effect of Random Pinning on the Yielding Transition of Amorphous Solid under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03874v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of random pinning, where we freeze the relaxation degrees of freedom for a fraction of randomly selected particles, on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear through extensive computer simulations. Using Kob-Anderson model as our model glass former, we pin a fraction of the particles. These pinned particles can move affinely under the imposed oscillatory shear deformation but are not allowed to relax through subsequent rearrangements due to plastic events. As the fraction of pinned particles increases, the system transitions from being a fragile glass former to a strong glass former. This gives us opportunity to examine how changes in fragility impact the yielding transition. Our results demonstrate notable differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers under random pinning. This aligns with previous observations where fragility was altered by changing the packing fraction in soft sphere model albeit with a main difference that random pinning significantly suppresses the formation of shear bands, even in well-annealed glass samples.</description>

      <title>The effects of fibre spatial distribution and relative orientation on the percolation and mechanics of stochastic fibre networks: A model of peptide hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structures of fibre networks can vary greatly due to fibre interactions during formation. We have modified the steps of generating Mikado networks to create two new model classes by altering the spatial distribution and relative orientation of their fibres to mimic the structures of self-assembling peptide hydrogels (SAPHs), whose physical properties depend strongly on their fibres' interactions. The results of our models and experiments on a set of beta-sheet forming SAPHs show that modifying a network's structure affects the percolation threshold and the mechanical behaviour of the material, both near percolation and at higher densities.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic motion of sliding droplets on strained soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft materials are ubiquitous in technological applications that require deformability, for instance, in flexible, water-repellent coatings. However, the wetting properties of pre-strained soft materials are only beginning to be explored. Here we study the sliding dynamics of droplets on pre-strained soft silicone gels, both in tension and in compression. Intriguingly, in compression we find a non-monotonic strain dependence of the sliding speed: mild compressions decelerate the droplets, but stronger compressions lead again to faster droplet motion. Upon further compression, creases nucleate under the droplets until finally, the entire surface undergoes the creasing instability, causing a ``run-and-stop" droplet motion. We quantitatively elucidate the speed modification for moderate pre-strains by incremental viscoelasticity, while the acceleration for larger strains turns out to be linked to the solid pressure, presumably through a lubrication effect of expelled oligomers.</description>

      <title>Homotopy classification of knotted defects in bounded domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nozaki et.~al.\ gave a homotopy classification of the knotted defects of ordered media in three-dimensional space by considering continuous maps from complements of spatial graphs to the order parameter space modulo a certain equivalence relation. We extend their result by giving a classification scheme for ordered media in handlebodies, where defects are allowed to reach the boundary. Through monodromies around meridional loops, global defects are described in terms of planar diagrams whose edges are colored by elements of the fundamental group of the order parameter space. We exhibit examples of this classification in octahedral frame fields and biaxial nematic liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Collective Dynamics of Intelligent Active Brownian Particles with Visual Perception and Velocity Alignment in 3D: Spheres, Rods, and Worms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many living systems, such as birds and fish, exhibit collective behaviors like flocking and swarming. Recently, an experimental system of active colloidal particles has been developed, where the motility of each particle is adjusted based on its visual detection of surrounding particles. These particles with visual-perception-dependent motility exhibit group formation and cohesion. Inspired by these behaviors, we investigate intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) equipped with visual perception and velocity alignment in three dimensions using computer simulations. The visual-perception-based self-steering describes the tendency of iABPs to move toward the center of mass of particles within their visual cones, while velocity alignment encourages alignment with neighboring particles. We examine how the behavior varies with the visual cone angle theta, self-propulsion speed (Peclet number Pe), and the interaction strengths of velocity alignment (Omega_a) and visual-based self-steering (Omega_v). Our findings show that spherical iABPs form clusters, worm-like clusters, milling behaviors, and dilute-gas phases, consistent with 2D studies. By reducing the simulation box size, we observe additional structures like band-like clusters and dense baitball formations. Additionally, rod-like iABPs form band-like, worm-like, radiating, and helical structures, while iABP worms exhibit streamlined and blob-like structures. Many of these patterns resemble collective behaviors in nature, such as ant milling, fish baitballs, and worm clusters. Advances in synthetic techniques could enable nanorobots with similar capabilities, offering insights into multicellular systems through active matter.</description>

      <title>Free energy of self-avoiding polymer chain confined between parallel walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and computing the entropic forces exerted by polymer chains under confinement is important for many reasons, from research to applications. However, extracting properties related to the free energy, such as the force (or pressure) on confining walls, does not readily emerge from conventional polymer dynamics simulations due to the entropic contributions inherent in these free energies. Here we propose an alternative method to compute such forces, and the associated free energies, based on empirically measuring the average force required to confine a polymer chain between parallel walls connected by an artificial elastic spring. This measurement enables us to interpolate the expression for the free energy of a confined self-avoiding chain and offer an analytical expression to complement the classical theory of ideal chains in confined spaces. Therefore, the significance of our method extends beyond the findings of this paper: it can be effectively employed to investigate the confinement free energy across diverse scenarios where all kinds of polymer chains are confined in a gap between parallel walls.</description>

      <title>Quasi-electrostatic eigenmode analysis of anisotropic particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties that arise from the directional and multispectral nature of anisotropic materials, leading to numerous potential applications in photonics, biomedicine, and magnetism. Furthermore, anisotropic particles are ubiquitous in naturally occurring and existing systems such as ice and dust grains, liquid crystal droplets, and ferromagnetic particles, and they correspond to atoms in magnetic fields and anisotropic molecules. However, despite considerable effort, the complexity that they introduce to the theory has significantly limited their eigenmode analysis, hindering their understanding and broad applicability. Here we analytically derive the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of anisotropic spheres and ellipsoids. We show that anisotropic particles exhibit novel radiation patterns. In addition, we identify axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting in uniaxial and biaxial particles and eigenvalue degeneracy in uniaxial spheres. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers in unexplored spectral regions and apply to additional fields of physics such as magnetism, heat conduction, and atomic and molecular physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical soap films drain under the influence of gravity, as indicated by the downward motion of colorful horizontal interference fringes observed on their surfaces. In this study conducted with rectangular soap films, we experimentally characterize the descent dynamics of these isothickness fringes and report its self-similar nature. We also show that this result is equivalent to thickness profiles exhibiting a separation of space and time. By integrating new measurements with data from the literature across various conditions, we validate these properties and establish the universality of the dynamics, governed by a single physical scalar. Our findings provide new insights for proposing a drainage model and understanding the mechanism of marginal regeneration at the origin of the process.</description>

      <title>On the origins of reverse Janssen effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider experimentally and computationally the phenomenon of the reverse Janssen effect, involving the counterintuitive finding that the force on the base of a column containing granular particles may be larger than the weight of the granular material itself. This finding is in contrast to the common Janssen effect, for which the force on the base is smaller than the particle weight, illustrating one of the best-known differences between granular and liquid systems. We find that the reverse Janssen effect is strongly influenced by the pouring protocol: under Earth's gravitational field, we find that the reverse Janssen effect is strongly and consistently influenced by the pouring height, as well as by (to somewhat lesser degree) pouring flux. Pouring grains from the height measured in tens of particle diameters leads to a reverse Janssen effect that is an order of magnitude stronger than the one found for small pouring heights of few particle diameters. This influence of the particles' delivery protocol allows for the development of a better understanding of the general features of the reverse Janssen effect and of the comparison between experiments and simulations reported in this and previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the decomposition of the pressure into the kinetic and the intermolecular contributions, we show that the pressure anisotropy in the fluid interface, which is the source of the interfacial tension, comes solely from the latter contribution. The pressure anisotropy due to the intermolecular force between the fluid particles in the same or the different fluid components is approximately proportional to the multiplication of the corresponding fluid density gradients, and from the molecular dynamics simulation of the liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interfaces, we demonstrate that the density gradient theory (DGT) by van der Waals gives the leading order approximation of the free energy density in inhomogeneous systems, neglecting the Tolman length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>
