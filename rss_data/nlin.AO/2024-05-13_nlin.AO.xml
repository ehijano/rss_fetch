      <title>Impact of pulse exposure on chimera state in ensemble of FitzHugh-Nagumo systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider the influence of a periodic sequence of Gaussian pulses on a chimera state in a ring of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. We found that on the way to complete spatial synchronization one can observe a number of variations of chimera states that are not typical for the parameter range under consideration. For example, the following modes were found: breathing chimera, chimera with intermittency in the incoherent part, traveling chimera with strong intermittency, and others. For comparison, here we also consider the impact of a harmonic influence on the same chimera, and to preserve the generality of the conclusions, we compare the regimes caused by both a purely positive harmonic influence and a positive-negative one.</description>

      <title>Multiple stochastic resonances and inverse stochastic resonances in asymmetric bistable system under the ultra-high frequency excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high frequency linear frequency modulation (UHF-LFM) signal, as a kind of typical non-stationary signal, has been widely used in microwave radar and other fields, with advantages such as long transmission distance, strong anti-interference ability, and wide bandwidth. Utilizing optimal dynamics response has unique advantages in weak feature identification under strong background noise. We propose a new stochastic resonance method in an asymmetric bistable system with the time-varying parameter to handle this special non-stationary signal. Interestingly, the nonlinear response exhibits multiple stochastic resonances (MSR) and inverse stochastic resonances (ISR) under UHF-LFM signal excitation, and some resonance regions may deviate or collapse due to the influence of system asymmetry. In addition, we analyze the responses of each resonance region and the mechanism and evolution law of each resonance region in detail. Finally, we significantly expand the resonance region within the parameter range by optimizing the time scale, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed time-varying scale method. The mechanism and evolution law of MSR and ISR will provide references for researchers in related fields.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control of recurrent neural networks using conceptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks excel at predicting and generating complex high-dimensional temporal patterns. Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data. In a Machine Learning setting, the network's parameters are adapted during a training phase to match the requirements of a given task/problem increasing its computational capabilities. After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.</description>

      <title>A stochastic approximation for the finite-size Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a stochastic model reduction of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for finitely many coupled phase oscillators with phase frustration. Whereas in the thermodynamic limit coupled oscillators exhibit stationary states and a constant order parameter, finite-size networks exhibit persistent temporal fluctuations of the order parameter. These fluctuations are caused by the interaction of the synchronized oscillators with the non-entrained oscillators. We present numerical results suggesting that the collective effect of the non-entrained oscillators on the synchronized cluster can be approximated by a Gaussian process. This allows for an effective closed evolution equation for the synchronized oscillators driven by a Gaussian process which we approximate by a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our reduction reproduces the stochastic fluctuations of the order parameter and leads to a simple stochastic differential equation for the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of a small heterogeneous chain network of neurons in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonlinear bidirectionally coupled heterogeneous chain network whose dynamics evolve in discrete time. The backbone of the model is a pair of popular map-based neuron models, the Chialvo and the Rulkov maps. This model is assumed to proximate the intricate dynamical properties of neurons in the widely complex nervous system. The model is first realized via various nonlinear analysis techniques: fixed point analysis, phase portraits, Jacobian matrix, and bifurcation diagrams. We observe the coexistence of chaotic and period-4 attractors. Various codimension-1 and -2 patterns for example saddle-node, period-doubling, Neimark-Sacker, double Neimark-Sacker, flip- and fold-Neimark Sacker, and 1:1 and 1:2 resonance are also explored. Furthermore, the study employs two synchronization measures to quantify how the oscillators in the network behave in tandem with each other over a long number of iterations. Finally, a time series analysis of the model is performed to investigate its complexity in terms of sample entropy.</description>

      <title>Exploring simplicity bias in 1D dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06989</link>

Abstract: Arguments inspired by algorithmic information theory predict an inverse relation between the probability and complexity of output patterns in a wide range of input-output maps. This phenomenon is known as \emph{simplicity bias}. By viewing the parameters of dynamical systems as inputs, and resulting (digitised) trajectories as outputs, we study simplicity bias in the logistic map, Gauss map, sine map, Bernoulli map, and tent map. We find that the logistic map, Gauss map, and sine map all exhibit simplicity bias upon sampling of map initial values and parameter values, but the Bernoulli map and tent map do not. The simplicity bias upper bound on output pattern probability is used to make \emph{a priori} predictions for the probability of output patterns. In some cases, the predictions are surprisingly accurate, given that almost no details of the underlying dynamical systems are assumed. More generally, we argue that studying probability-complexity relationships may be a useful tool in studying patterns in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>
