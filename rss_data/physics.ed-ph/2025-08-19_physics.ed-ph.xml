      <title>High School Science Profile Predicts Adults' Views on the Future of AI and STS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the long term influence of high school science education on adults' engagement with artificial intelligence (AI) and their views on science-technology-society (STS) issues. Drawing on longitudinal data from the Korea Employment Education Panel (KEEP) II (n = 2,348), which tracked general high school students from 2016 to 2023, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine how science interest and achievement in adolescence predict AI use and perceptions in adulthood. Results indicate that high school science achievement, but not science interest, directly predicted AI use at age 24. AI use significantly influenced both positive and negative perceptions of AI, which in turn shaped sophisticated perspectives on STS domains - human-AI relationship, quality of life, and science and technology monopolization. Indirect effects suggest that high school science interest can influence adult perceptions of AI and STS views, mediated by science achievement and AI use. These findings provide rare empirical evidence linking secondary science education to adult engagement with AI.</description>

      <title>Click, Watch, Learn: The Impact of Student Self-Study Materials on Physics E&amp;M Course Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance in introductory courses, particularly physics, is often crucial for student success in STEM majors and can impact an individual's tendency to persist in their chosen field. To enhance students' individual learning experiences, faculty at many universities have worked to develop open-access, self-study materials to help build conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. Faculty at Texas A&amp;M University have contributed to these efforts, creating more than 200 online video resources and a broad bank of prior exams available to students. This work explores and measures the impact that these resources can have on student course outcomes in an introductory, calculus-based electricity and magnetism course. Data were collected from three fall semesters, 2021-2023, including classroom performance, a conceptual assessment, and relevant university level data to contextualize student background and pre-class abilities. Similar to prior studies, we found that relevant prior preparation in mathematics was the strongest predictor of student performance, with prior physics knowledge being a weaker but still statistically significant predictor. Students' utilization of supplemental old exams was the second highest predictor of student performance. First generation students were observed to have a slightly lower average performance on exams. However, interaction terms in the regression models indicated that first generation students using supplemental old exams were able to close this gap. Through anonymous surveys, students reported warm impressions of the materials, with over 80 per cent of students sharing that they had a noticeable contribution to their learning outside of the classroom and 98 per cent stating they would recommend them to their peers.</description>

      <title>Developing a ChatGPT-Based Tool for Physics Experiment Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how advanced AI assistants can help physics educators create practical teaching tools without specialized programming skills. Using the square-wave synthesis experiment as a case, we target common obstacles in laboratory instruction-complex setup, unstable signals, and limited class time-and show how AI-assisted development can shift attention from wiring and calibration to core physical ideas.
  To address this need, we guided an AI assistant through iterative prompts to generate a clean, runnable program that visualizes square-wave synthesis from its component sine waves. The tool supports step-by-step construction of the waveform, adjustable parameters (amplitude, frequency, and phase), and immediate comparison with an ideal reference using simple error measures. We packaged the result as a standalone application so it runs reliably on standard classroom computers, enabling pre-lab demonstrations and interactive exploration that reduce procedural friction and highlight underlying concepts.
  Building on this proof of concept, we argue the same workflow extends to other topics-such as simple harmonic motion and optical interference-where adjustable parameters and real-time visualization deepen understanding. We conclude that AI-assisted co-design can improve teaching efficiency, enhance student engagement with foundational principles, and provide a scalable path for developing customizable physics education tools.</description>

      <title>Engaging young people for a more inclusive national energy transition: A participatory modelling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Participatory research in energy system modelling can generate bottom-up knowledge to explore co-designed future net-zero energy system scenarios. However, it often fails to facilitate collective learning, explore explicitly informed perspectives, and frequently ignores underrepresented groups like youth, among whom distrust about the energy transformation process is growing. By modifying a national electricity system model to reflect young people's socio-techno-environmental insights gathered through school workshops, this study presents a framework for envisioning future net-zero power systems in Norway. Given pupil priorities regarding certain power system aspects and their cumulative impact, substantial shifts occur in national renewable capacity potentials (approximately plus or minus 50%), system costs (-7% to +25%), technology mixes (notably onshore wind from 40% to 0%), transmission capacities (near doubling), and regional equity assessments. We find that costly youth-driven system designs do not necessarily guarantee equitable systems. Although applied to young people in Norway, the proposed workshop-informed modelling framework serves as a tool to meaningfully engage diverse groups and capture their perspectives, thereby further democratising energy system planning. The approach is expected to help address social acceptance challenges through enhanced understanding of trade-offs in the energy transformation process.</description>
