      <title>Existence of Optimal Contracts for Principal-Agent Problem with Drift Control and Quadratic Effort Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of optimal contracts of the principal-agent problem is a long-standing problem. According to the general framework in Cvitani\'c et al. [2], this existence can be derived from the existence of a classical solution to a degenerated fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation problem. In this work we consider the simple case with drift control and quadratic cost function, then prove the existence of classical solution to that PDE.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stock Return Distributions and Pricing Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides evidence that stock returns, after truncation, might be modeled by a special type of continuous mixtures or normals, so-called $q$-Gaussians. Negative binomial distributions might model the counts for extreme returns. A generalized jump-diffusion model is proposed, and an explicit option pricing formula is obtained.</description>

      <title>Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection in Long-Term Investments with Unknown Distribution: Online Estimation, Risk Aversion under Ambiguity, and Universality of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard approach for constructing a Mean-Variance portfolio involves estimating parameters for the model using collected samples. However, since the distribution of future data may not resemble that of the training set, the out-of-sample performance of the estimated portfolio is worse than one derived with true parameters, which has prompted several innovations for better estimation. Instead of treating the data without a timing aspect as in the common training-backtest approach, this paper adopts a perspective where data gradually and continuously reveal over time. The original model is recast into an online learning framework, which is free from any statistical assumptions, to propose a dynamic strategy of sequential portfolios such that its empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, and growth rate asymptotically achieve those of the true portfolio, derived with perfect knowledge of the future data.
  When the distribution of future data follows a normal shape, the growth rate of wealth is shown to increase by lifting the portfolio along the efficient frontier through the calibration of risk aversion. Since risk aversion cannot be appropriately predetermined, another proposed algorithm updates this coefficient over time, forming a dynamic strategy that approaches the optimal empirical Sharpe ratio or growth rate associated with the true coefficient. The performance of these proposed strategies can be universally guaranteed under stationary stochastic markets. Furthermore, in certain time-reversible stochastic markets, the so-called Bayesian strategy utilizing true conditional distributions, based on past market information during investment, does not perform better than the proposed strategies in terms of empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, or growth rate, which, in contrast, do not rely on conditional distributions.</description>

      <title>Real-world models for multiple term structures: a unifying HJM semimartingale framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for modeling multiple term structures arising in financial, insurance, and energy markets, adopting an extended Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) approach under the real-world probability. We study market viability and characterize the set of local martingale deflators. We conduct an analysis of the associated stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), addressing existence and uniqueness of solutions, invariance properties and existence of affine realizations.</description>
