      <title>Inversion for Inferring Solar Meridional Circulation: The Case with Constraints on Angular Momentum Transport inside the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out inversions of travel times as measured by Gizon et al. (2020) to infer the internal profile of the solar meridional circulation (MC). A linear inverse problem has been solved by the regularized least-squares method with a constraint that the angular momentum (AM) transport by MC should be equatorward (HK21-type constraint). Our motivation for using this constraint is based on the result by Hotta and Kusano (2021) where the solar equator-fast rotation was reproduced successfully without any manipulation. The inversion result indicates that the MC profile is a double-cell structure if the so-called HK21 regime, in which AM transported by MC sustains the equator-fast rotation, correctly describes the physics inside the solar convective zone. The sum of the squared residuals computed with the inferred double-cell MC profile is comparable to that computed with the single-cell MC profile obtained when we exclude the HK21-type constraint, showing that both profiles can explain the data more or less at the same level. However, we also find that adding the HK21-type constraint degrades the resolution of the averaging kernels. Although it is difficult for us to determine the large-scale morphology of the solar MC at the moment, our attempt highlights the relevance of investigating the solar MC profile from both theoretical and observational perspectives.</description>

      <title>The Absolute Age of NGC 3201 derived from Detached Eclipsing Binaries and the Hess Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 3201 using $10,000$ sets of theoretical isochrones constructed through Monte Carlo simulation using the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program. These isochrones take into consideration of uncertainty introduced by the choice of stellar evolution parameters. We fit isochrones with 3 detached eclipsing binaries and obtained an age independent of distance. We also fit isochrones with differential reddening corrected HST photometry data utilizing two different Hess diagram based fitting methods. Results from 3 different methods analyzing 2 different types of data agree to within $1 \sigma$, and we find the absolute age of NGC 3201 $= 11.85 \pm 0.74$ Gyr. We also perform variable importance analysis to study the uncertainty contribution from individual parameters and we find the distance is the dominance source of uncertainty in photometry based analysis while total metallicity, Helium abundance, $\alpha$-element abundance, mixing length, and treatment of helium diffusion are important source of uncertainties for all 3 methods.</description>

      <title>A two-minute burst of highly polarised radio emission originating from low Galactic latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several sources of repeating coherent bursts of radio emission with periods of many minutes have now been reported in the literature. These ``ultra-long period'' (ULP) sources have no clear multi-wavelength counterparts and challenge canonical pulsar emission models, leading to debate regarding their nature. In this work we report the discovery of a bright, highly-polarised burst of radio emission at low Galactic latitude as part of a wide-field survey for transient and variable radio sources. ASKAP\,J175534.9$-$252749.1 does not appear to repeat, with only a single intense two-minute $\sim 200$\,mJy burst detected from 60~hours of observations. The burst morphology and polarisation properties are comparable to those of classical pulsars but the duration is more than one hundred times longer, analogous to ULPs. No comparable bursts are detected in the rest of our widefield survey to date. Combined with the existing ULP population, this suggests that these sources have a strong Galactic latitude dependence and hints at an unexplored population of transient and variable radio sources in the thin disk of the Milky Way. The resemblance of this burst with both ULPs and pulsars calls for a unified coherent emission model for objects with spin periods from milliseconds to tens of minutes. However, whether or not these are all neutron stars or have the same underlying power source remains open for debate.</description>

      <title>Ariel stellar characterisation II. Chemical abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen for 181 planet-host FGK dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the ultimate goals of the ESA Ariel space mission is to shed light on the formation pathways and evolution of planetary systems in the Solar neighbourhood. Such an endeavour is only possible by performing a large chemical survey of not only the planets, but also their host stars, inasmuch as stellar elemental abundances are the cipher key to decode the planetary compositional signatures. This work aims at providing homogeneous abundances of C, N, and O of a sample of 181 stars belonging to the Tier 1 of the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample. We applied the spectral synthesis and the equivalent width methods to a variety of atomic and molecular indicators (C I lines at 5052 and 5380.3 A, [O I] forbidden line at 6300.3 A, C_2 bands at 5128 and 5165 A, and CN band at 4215 A) using high-resolution and high S/N spectra collected with several spectrographs. We provide carbon abundances for 180 stars, nitrogen abundances for 105 stars, and oxygen abundances for 89 stars. We analyse the results in the light of the Galactic chemical evolution, and in terms of the planetary companions properties. Our sample basically follows the typical trends with metallicity expected for the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] abundance ratios. The fraction between C and O abundances, both yields of primary production, is consistent with a constant ratio as [O/H] increases, whereas the abundance of N tends to increase with the increasing of the O abundance, supporting the theoretical assumption of a secondary production of nitrogen. The [C/N], [C/O], and [N/O] ratios are also correlated with [Fe/H], which might introduce biases in the interpretation of the planetary compositions and formation histories if host stars of different metallicity are compared. We provide relations that can be used to qualitatively estimate whether the atmospheric composition of planets is enriched or not with respect to the host stars.</description>

      <title>Period-luminosity and period-luminosity-metallicity relations for Galactic RR Lyrae stars in the Sloan bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars are excellent tracers of the old population II due to their period-luminosity (PL) and period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations. While these relations have been investigated in detail in many photometric bands, there are few comprehensive studies about them in Sloan-like systems. We present PL and PLZ relations (as well as their counterparts in Wesenheit magnitudes) in the Sloan-Pan-STARSS gP1rP1iP1 bands obtained for Galactic RR Lyrae stars in the vincinity of the Sun. The data used in this paper were collected with the network of 40 cm telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory, and geometric parallaxes were adopted from Gaia Data Release 3. We derived PL and PLZ relations separately for RRab and RRc-type stars, as well as for the mixed population of RRab+RRc stars. To our knowledge, these are the first PL and PLZ relations in the Sloan bands determined using RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic field.</description>

      <title>Fine Structure of the Age-Chromospheric Activity Relation in Solar-Type Stars: II. H$\alpha$ Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excess chromospheric emissions within deep photospheric lines are effective proxies of stellar magnetism for FGK stars. This emission decays with stellar age and is a potential determinant of this important stellar quantity. We report absolutely calibrated H$\alpha$ chromospheric fluxes for 511 solar-type stars in a wide interval of precisely determined masses, $[$Fe/H$]$, ages, and evolution states from high S/N, moderately high$-$resolution spectra. The comparison of H$\alpha$ and H+K chromospheric fluxes reveals a metallicity bias (absent from H$\alpha$) affecting Ca II H+K fluxes thereby metal-rich stars with deep line profiles mimic low chromospheric flux levels, and vice versa for metal-poor stars. This bias blurs the age-activity relation, precluding age determinations for old, inactive stars unless mass and $[$Fe/H$]$ are calibrated into the relation. The H+K lines being the most widely studied tool to quantify magnetic activity in FGK stars, care should be exercised in its use whenever wide ranges of mass and $[$Fe/H$]$ are involved. The H$\alpha$ age-activity-mass-metallicity calibration appears to be in line with the theoretical expectation that (other parameters being equal) more massive stars possess narrower convective zones and are less active than less massive stars, while more metal-rich stars have deeper convective zones and appear more active than metal-poorer stars. If regarded statistically in tandem with other age diagnostics, H$\alpha$ chromospheric fluxes may be suitable to constrain ages for FGK stars with acceptable precision.</description>

      <title>Doppler Dimming and Brightening Effects in Solar Prominences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored the impact that Doppler dimming and brightening effects from bulk motions of solar prominences have on the formation of Lya, Ha, and MgII h line profiles. We compared two schemes in which these effects manifest; when the prominence is moving radially away from the solar surface (radial case), and when the prominence is moving parallel to the solar surface (horizontal case). To do this, we analysed 13,332 model profiles generated through the use of the 1D NLTE (i.e. departures from Local Thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer (RT) code Promweaver, built on the Lightweaver NLTE RT framework to mimic the behaviour and output of the 1D NLTE RT code PROM. We found that horizontal velocities are just as, or more important than radial velocities. This demonstrates that horizontal velocities need to be accounted for when attempting to do any sort of forward modelling.</description>

      <title>Periodic variable A-F spectral type stars in the southern TESS continuous viewing zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We accurately identify and classify the variability of A-F stars in the southern continuous viewing zone of the TESS satellite. The brightness limit was set to 10 mag to ensure the utmost reliability of our results and allow for spectroscopic follow-up observations using small telescopes. We aim to compare our findings with existing catalogues of variable stars. The light curves from TESS and their Fourier transform were used to manually classify stars in our sample. Cross-matching with other catalogues was performed to identify contaminants and false positives. We have identified 1171 variable stars (51 % of the sample). Among these variable stars, 67 % have clear classifications, which includes $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor pulsating stars and their hybrids, rotationally variables, and eclipsing binaries. We have provided examples of the typical representatives of variable stars and discussed the ambiguous cases. We found 20 pairs of stars with the same frequencies and identified the correct source of the variations. Additionally, we found that the variations in 12 other stars are caused by the contamination with the light of faint nearby large-amplitude variable stars. To compare our sample with other variable star catalogues, we have defined two parameters reflecting the agreement in identification of variable stars and their classification. This comparison reveals intriguing disagreements in classification ranging from 52 % to 100 %. However, if we assume that stars without specific types are only marked as variable, then the agreement is relatively good, ranging from 57 % to 85 % (disagreement 15-43 %). We have demonstrated that the TESS classification is superior to the classification based on other photometric surveys. The classification of stellar variability is complex and requires careful consideration. Caution should be exercised when using catalogue classifications.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Supersonic Stellar Wind: Parker's Theory Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the classical theory of stellar wind formation. The theory requires that to form a supersonic stellar wind, a subsonic flow speed must start at a specific initial speed from the coronal base, called eigenspeed, go along a continuous eigenfunction, and reach the sonic point, which is where the flow speed equals the sonic speed, while the critical condition, which is where the effective driving force is zero, is satisfied. Any mismatch between the sonic point and critical condition distances results in either subsonic winds when the initial speed is below the eigenspeed, or no stellar wind when the initial speed is above the eigenspeed. However, because the critical condition is determined by the stellar wind temperature profile, which depends on ionization process at the top of the chromosphere and the heating process around the coronal base but not by the processes at the sonic point, the requirement of sonic point satisfying the critical condition is generally not met and hence the momentum equation in the conventional theory encounters difficulty when the initial speed is above the eigenspeed. To resolve the difficulty, we propose a discontinuity between the sonic point and the critical condition to reach supersonic stellar wind solutions. As a result, supersonic stellar winds can be produced when the initial speed in the coronal base is greater than the eigenspeed. The critical solution or eigen function provided by the conventional stellar wind model describes the condition that separates the supersonic stellar winds from subsonic ones.</description>

      <title>A JWST project on 47 Tucanae. NIRSpec spectroscopy of multiple populations among M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first spectroscopic estimates of the chemical abundance of M dwarf stars in a globular cluster (GC), namely 47 Tucanae. By exploiting NIRSpec on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we gathered low-resolution spectra for 28 stars with masses in the range ~0.4-0.5 solar masses. The spectra are strongly affected by the H2O water vapour bands which can be used as indicators of the oxygen abundance. The spectral analysis reveals that the target stars feature a different O abundance, with a difference of ~0.40 dex between first and the most-polluted second population. The observed range is similar to that observed among red giant stars. This result reinforces previous findings based on the analysis of photometric diagrams, including the ``chromosome maps'', providing a first, and more direct, evidence of light element variations in the M dwarfs' mass regime. The observation that the multiple populations, with their variations in light elements, exhibit the same patterns from the lower main sequence all the way to the red giant branch further strengthens the notion that multiple stellar populations in globular clusters formed in a series of bursts of star formation.</description>

      <title>The Enigma of Li-Rich Giants and its Relation with Temporal Variations Observed in Radial Velocity and Stellar Activity Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the large number of studies focused on the characterization of Li-rich stars and understanding of the mechanisms leading to such enrichment, their origin remains a mystery. Magnetic activity, in particular the phenomena usually associated with it, such as spots and plages, and the Li abundance (A(Li)) of stars, are in general thought to be connected. However, as of today it is unclear just how. In this work, we study a sample of young but evolved intermediate mass red giants, inhabitants of open clusters where planets have been searched. We aim at using radial velocity (RV) and stellar activity indicator signals to look for relations between Li abundances and stellar activity/variability. We explore how the standard deviation (STD), peak to peak amplitude (PTP), mean and median of typical stellar activity indicators (BIS, FWHM, $T_\textrm{eff}$, and H$\alpha$ index) change as a function of the Li content of 82 red giants. Furthermore, we compute weighted Pearson Correlation Coefficients ($\rho_w$) between time series of RV measurements and the stellar activity indicators for the stars in our sample. To aid our results, we also study Generalized Lomb-Scargle Periodograms (GLSP) to capture possible significant periodic temporal variations in our data. Our analysis indicates that the STD and PTP of BIS and FWHM, the mean and median of the H$\alpha$ index and $v\sin(i)$ increase exponentially with A(Li) in our sample of red giants. Significant temporal variations and correlations between RVs and activity indicators also tend to be found preferentially for stars where high A(Li) is observed. Most of the Li-rich stars in our sample either show strong correlations of RV with at least one of the stellar activity indicators or reveal significant periodic temporal variations in their stellar activity indicators GLSPs consistent with those found for RV.</description>

      <title>Predicting the energetic proton flux with a machine learning regression algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need of real-time of monitoring and alerting systems for Space Weather hazards has grown significantly in the last two decades. One of the most important challenge for space mission operations and planning is the prediction of solar proton events (SPEs). In this context, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have opened a new frontier, providing a new paradigm for statistical forecasting algorithms. The great majority of these models aim to predict the occurrence of a SPE, i.e., they are based on the classification approach. In this work we present a simple and efficient machine learning regression algorithm which is able to forecast the energetic proton flux up to 1 hour ahead by exploiting features derived from the electron flux only. This approach could be helpful to improve monitoring systems of the radiation risk in both deep space and near-Earth environments. The model is very relevant for mission operations and planning, especially when flare characteristics and source location are not available in real time, as at Mars distance.</description>

      <title>Modelling predicts a molecule-rich disk around the AGB star L2 Puppis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby oxygen-rich AGB star L2 Pup hosts a well-studied nearly edge-on disk. To date, disks around AGB stars have not been chemically studied in detail. By combining a parameterisation commonly used for protoplanetary disks and archival ALMA observations, we retrieved an updated density and temperature structure of this disk. This physical model was then used as input to the first chemical model of an AGB disk. The model shows that the physical structure of the disk has a large impact on its chemistry, with certain species showing large changes in column density relative to a radial outflow, indicating that chemistry could be used as a tracer of disks that cannot be directly imaged. Despite its oxygen-rich nature, the daughter species formed within the disk are surprisingly carbon-rich. Two chemical regimes can be distinguished: cosmic-ray induced chemistry in the midplane and photochemistry induced by the interstellar radiation field in the outer regions. Certain complex organic molecules are formed in the midplane. This occurs via gas-phase chemistry only, as the disk is too warm for dust-gas chemistry. The photochemistry in the outer regions leads to the efficient formation of (long) carbon-chains. The predictions of the model allow us to tentatively put the disk's age $\lesssim 10^5$ yr. Additional observations are necessary to better constrain the physical structure of L2 Pup's disk and are essential to test the predictions made by the chemical model. Our exploratory work paves the way for a more general study of the chemistry of AGB disks.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mass determination and partial eclipses of the heartbeat star HD 181793</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the bright Am-type star HD 181793 to be a previously-unknown eclipsing, chemically peculiar heartbeat binary, the second of its kind known. The system carries an orbital period of $P = 11.47578275 \pm 0.00000055$ days. We use TESS photometry and LCOGT NRES radial velocity data to build a self-consistent orbital model and determine the fundamental stellar characteristics of the primary. We use a spectral separation method to unveil the secondary and measure the masses of both stars. The radial velocity amplitude of the primary, $K_1 = 47.41+0.13-0.12 km s^{-1}$, gives a mass $M_1 = 1.57 \pm 0.01 $ Msun. The secondary radial velocity amplitude $K_2 = 84.95+0.12-0.09 km s^{-1}$ yields a mass ratio $q = 0.558 \pm 0.002$ and a secondary mass $M_2 = 0.87 \pm 0.01 $ Msun. From the spectral energy distribution and Gaia parallax we find a radius $R_1 = 2.04 \pm 0.05$ Rsun. The grazing transit profile and spectroscopic luminosity ratio indicate $R_2 = 1.04+0.15-0.10$ Rsun, suggesting an early-K spectral type. We show that the heartbeat feature in the TESS light curve can be explained by time-varying ellipsoidal variation, driven by the orbital eccentricity of $e = 0.3056+0.0024-0.0026$, and relativistic beaming of the light of the primary. We find no evidence of tidally-excited oscillations.</description>

      <title>C/O Ratios and the formation of wide separation exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas and solid-state C/O ratios provide context to potentially link the atmospheric composition of planets to that of the natal disk. We provide a synthesis of extant estimates of the gaseous C/O and C/H ratios in planet-forming disks obtained primarily through analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations. These estimates are compared to atmospheric abundances of wide separation (&gt; 10 au) gas giants. The resolved disk gas C/O ratios, from seven systems, generally exhibit C/O &gt; 1 with sub-solar, or depleted, carbon content. In contrast, wide separation gas giants have atmospheric C/O ratios that cluster near or slightly above the presumed stellar value with a range of elemental C/H. From the existing disk composition, we infer that the solid-state mm/cm-sized pebbles have a total C/O ratio (solid cores and ices) that is solar (stellar) in content. We explore simple models that reconstruct the exoplanet atmospheric composition from the disk, while accounting for silicate cloud formation in the planet atmosphere. If wide separate planets formed via the core-accretion mechanism, they must acquire their metals from pebble or planetesimal accretion. Further, the dispersion in giant planet C/H content is best matched by a disk composition with modest and variable factors of carbon depletion. An origin of the wide separation gas giants via gravitational instability cannot be ruled out as stellar C/O ratios should natively form in this scenario. However, the variation in planet metallicity with a stellar C/O ratio potentially presents challenges to these models.</description>

      <title>The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER). VI. The High-Mass Stellar Initial Mass Function of M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the high-mass stellar initial mass function (IMF) from resolved stars in M33 young stellar clusters. Leveraging \textit{Hubble Space Telescope's} high resolving power, we fully model the IMF probabilistically. We first model the optical CMD of each cluster to constrain its power-law slope $\Gamma$, marginalized over other cluster parameters in the fit (e.g., cluster age, mass, and radius). We then probabilistically model the distribution of MF slopes for a highly strict cluster sample of 9 clusters more massive than log(Mass/M$_{\odot}$)=3.6; above this mass, all clusters have well-populated main sequences of massive stars and should have accurate recovery of their MF slopes, based on extensive tests with artificial clusters. We find the ensemble IMF is best described by a mean high-mass slope of $\overline{\Gamma} = 1.49\pm0.18$, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma^{2}_{\Gamma} = 0.02^{+0.16}_{0.00}$, consistent with a universal IMF. We find no dependence of the IMF on environmental impacts such as the local star formation rate or galactocentric radius within M33, which serves as a proxy for metallicity. This $\overline{\Gamma}$ measurement is consistent with similar measurements in M31, despite M33 having a much higher star formation rate intensity. While this measurement is formally consistent with the canonical Kroupa ($\Gamma = 1.30$) IMF, as well as the Salpeter ($\Gamma = 1.35)$) value, it is the second Local Group cluster sample to show evidence for a somewhat steeper high-mass IMF slope. We explore the impacts a steeper IMF slope has on a number of astronomical sub-fields.</description>

      <title>Merger Precursor: Year-long Transients Preceding Mergers of Low-mass Stripped Stars with Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor's envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.</description>

      <title>Light curve's recovery with Rubin-LSST: II. UnVEiling the darknesS of The gAlactic buLgE (VESTALE) with RR Lyrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is part of VESTALE, a project initiated within the Rubin-LSST Cadence Strategy Optimization Process . Its goal is to explore the potential of Rubin-LSST observations aimed at the Galaxy's bulge (Bulge) for studying RR Lyrae stars (RRL). Observation and analysis of RR Lyrae stars in the Bulge are crucial for tracing the old population of the central part of our galaxy and reconstructing the history of Bulge formation. Based on observations conducted with CTIO/DECam by Saha et al. 2019 towards the Baade Window, our simulations demonstrate that early Rubin-LSST observations will enable the recovery of RR Lyrae light curves at Galactic center distances with sufficient precision. This will allow us to utilize theoretical relations from Marconi et al. 2022 to determine their distances and/or metallicity, following the REDIME algorithm introduced in Bono et al. 2019. We show how reddening and crowding affect our simulations and highlight the importance of considering these effects when deriving pulsation parameters (luminosity amplitudes, mean magnitudes) based on the light curves especially if the goal is to explore the opposite side of the Bulge through the observation of its RRL. The simulations discussed in this investigation were conducted to support the SCOC's decision to observe this important sky region since it has only recently been decided to include part of the Bulge as a target within the LSST main survey.</description>

      <title>Dynamical traceback age of the Octans young stellar association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Octans is one of the most distant ($d\sim150$pc) young stellar associations of the solar neighbourhood. Its age is still poorly constrained in the literature and requires further investigation. We take advantage of the state-of-the-art astrometry delivered by the third data release of the Gaia space mission combined with radial velocity measurements obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to compute the 3D positions and 3D spatial velocities of the stars and derive the dynamical traceback age of the association. We performed an extensive traceback analysis using different subsamples of stars, different metrics to define the size of the association, and different models for the Galactic potential to integrate the stellar orbits in the past. We derive a dynamical age of $34^{+2}_{-2}$Myr that is independent from stellar models and represents the most precise age estimate currently available for the Octans association. After correcting the radial velocity of the stars for the effect of gravitational redshift, we obtain a dynamical age of $33^{+3}_{-1}$Myr, which is in very good agreement with our first solution. This shows that the effect of gravitational redshift is small for such a distant young stellar association. Our result is also consistent with the less accurate age estimates obtained in previous studies from lithium depletion (30-40Myr) and isochrones (20-30Myr). By integrating the stellar orbits in time, we show that the members of Octans and Octans-Near had different locations in the past, which indicates that the two associations are unrelated despite the close proximity in the sky. Our results confirm that it is possible to derive precise dynamical ages via the traceback method for $\sim30$Myr old stellar clusters at about $\sim150$pc with the same precision level that has been achieved in other studies for young stellar groups within 50pc of the Sun.</description>

      <title>The Aligned Orbit of a Hot Jupiter around the M Dwarf TOI-4201</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the obliquities of stars hosting giant planets may shed light on the dynamical history of planetary systems. Significant efforts have been made to measure the obliquities of FGK stars with hot Jupiters, mainly based on observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. In contrast, M dwarfs with hot Jupiters have hardly been explored, because such systems are rare and often not favorable for such precise observations. Here, we report the first detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for an M dwarf with a hot Jupiter, TOI-4201, using the Gemini-North/MAROON-X spectrograph. We find TOI-4201 to be well-aligned with its giant planet, with a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda=-3.0_{-3.2}^{+3.7}\ ^{\circ}$ and a true obliquity of $\psi=21.3_{-12.8}^{+12.5}\ ^{\circ}$ with an upper limit of $40^{\circ}$ at a 95\% confidence level. The result agrees with dynamically quiet formation or tidal obliquity damping that realigned the system. As the first hot Jupiter around an M dwarf with its obliquity measured, TOI-4201b joins the group of aligned giant planets around cool stars ($T_{\rm eff}&lt;6250\ K$), as well as the small but growing sample of planets with relatively high planet-to-star mass ratio ($M_p/M_\ast\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-3}$) that also appear to be mostly aligned.</description>

      <title>A Dust-Trapping Ring in the Planet-Hosting Disk of Elias 2-24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rings and gaps are among the most widely observed forms of substructure in protoplanetary disks. A gap-ring pair may be formed when a planet carves a gap in the disk, which produces a local pressure maximum following the gap that traps inwardly drifting dust grains and appears as a bright ring due to the enhanced dust density. A dust-trapping ring would provide a promising environment for solid growth and possibly planetesimal production via the streaming instability. We present evidence of dust trapping in the bright ring of the planet-hosting disk Elias 2-24, from the analysis of 1.3 mm and 3 mm ALMA observations at high spatial resolution (0.029 arcsec, 4.0 au). We leverage the high spatial resolution to demonstrate that larger grains are more efficiently trapped and place constraints on the local turbulence ($8 \times 10^{-4} &lt; \alpha_\mathrm{turb} &lt; 0.03$) and the gas-to-dust ratio ($\Sigma_g / \Sigma_d &lt; 30$) in the ring. Using a scattering-included marginal probability analysis we measure a total dust disk mass of $M_\mathrm{dust} = 13.8^{+0.7}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-4} \ M_\odot$. We also show that at the orbital radius of the proposed perturber, the gap is cleared of material down to a flux contrast of 10$^{-3}$ of the peak flux in the disk.</description>

      <title>Jet formation in post-AGB binaries: Confronting cold magnetohydrodynamic disc wind wind models with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: We consider cold self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc wind solutions to describe jets that are launched from the circumcompanion accretion discs in post-AGB binaries. Resulting predictions are matched to observations for five different post-AGB binaries. This both tests the physical validity of the MHD disc wind paradigm and reveals the accretion disc properties. Results: Many of the time-series' properties are reproduced well by the models, though systematic mismatches, such as overestimated rotation, remain. Four targets imply accretion discs that reach close to the secondary's stellar surface, while one is fitted with an unrealistically large inner radius of about 20 stellar radii. Some fits imply inner disc temperatures over 10 000 K, seemingly discrepant with a previous observational estimate from H band interferometry. This estimate is, however, shown to be biased. Fitted mass-accretion rates range from about 10^-6 to 10^-3 solar masses per year. Relative to the jets launched from young stellar objects (YSOs), all targets prefer winds with higher ejection efficiencies, lower magnetizations and thicker discs. Conclusions: Our models show that current cold MHD disc wind solutions can explain many of the jet-related Balmer alpha features seen in post-AGB binaries, though systematic discrepancies remain. This includes, but is not limited to, overestimated rotation and underestimated post-AGB circumbinary disc lifetimes. The consideration of thicker discs and the inclusion of irradiation from the post-AGB primary, leading to warm magnetothermal wind launching, might alleviate these.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow Object Formation: Assembly via Common Envelope in Field Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects (T\.{Z}Os), hypothetical merger products in which a neutron star is embedded in a stellar core, are traditionally considered steady-state configurations. Their assembly, especially through dynamical channels, is not well-understood. The predominant focus in the literature has been on the observational signatures related to the evolution and long-term fate of T\.{Z}Os, with their initial formation often treated as a given. However, the foundational calculations supporting the existence of T\.{Z}Os assume non-rotating spherically-symmetric initial conditions that we find to be inconsistent with a binary merger scenario. In this work, we explore the implications of post-merger dynamics in T\.{Z}O formation scenarios with field binary progenitors, specifically the role that angular momentum transport during the common envelope phase plays in constraining possible merger products, using the tools of stellar evolution and three-dimensional hydrodynamics. We also propose an alternative steady-state outcome for these mergers: the thin-envelope T\.{Z}O, an equilibrium solution consisting of a low-mass spherical envelope supported by the accretion disk luminosity of a central stellar-mass black hole. These configurations may be of interest to upcoming time-domain surveys as potential X-ray sources that may be preceded by a series of bright transient events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a planned radio interferometer providing unprecedented sensitivity at wavelengths between 21 cm and 3 mm. Its 263 antenna element array will be spatially distributed across North America to enable both superb low surface brightness recovery and sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution imaging. The project was developed by the international astronomy community under the lead of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and is anticipated to be built between 2027 and 2037. Two workshops have been held in 2022 and 2023 with the goal to discuss and consolidate the scientific interests in the ngVLA within the German astronomical community. This community paper constitutes a collection of 48 science ideas which the German community aims to pursue with the ngVLA in the 2030s. This is not a complete list and the ideas are not developed at the level of a "Science Book", such that the present document is mainly meant provide a basis for further discussion within the community. As such, additional contributions are welcome, and will be considered for inclusion in future revisions.</description>

      <title>Temperature inversion in a confined plasma atmosphere: coarse-grained effect of temperature fluctuations at its base</title>

Abstract: Prompted by the relevant problem of temperature inversion (i.e. gradient of density anti-correlated to the gradient of temperature) in astrophysics, we introduce a novel method to model a gravitationally confined multi-component collisionless plasma in contact with a fluctuating thermal boundary. We focus on systems with anti-correlated (inverted) density and temperature profiles, with applications to solar physics. The dynamics of the plasma is analytically described via the coupling of an appropriated coarse-grained distribution function and temporally coarse-grained Vlasov dynamics. We derive a stationary solution of the system and predict the inverted density and temperature profiles of the two-species for scenarios relevant for the corona. We validate our method by comparing the analytical results with kinetic numerical simulations of the plasma dynamics in the context of the two-species Hamiltonian mean-field model (HMF). Finally, we apply our theoretical framework to the problem of the temperature inversion in the solar corona obtaining density and temperature profiles in remarkably good agreement with the observations.</description>

      <title>Natural-linewidth measurements of the 3C and 3D soft-x-ray transitions in Ni XIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used the monochromatic soft-x-ray beamline P04 at the synchrotron-radiation facility PETRA III to resonantly excite the strongest $2p-3d$ transitions in neon-like Ni XIX ions, $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{1/2}\,3d_{3/2}]_{J=1}$ and $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{3/2}\,3d_{5/2}]_{J=1}$, respectively dubbed 3C and 3D, achieving a resolving power of 15\,000 and signal-to-background ratio of 30. We obtain their natural linewidths, with an accuracy of better than 10\%, as well as the oscillator-strength ratio $f(3C)/f(3D)$ = 2.51(11) from analysis of the resonant fluorescence spectra. These results agree with those of previous experiments, earlier predictions, and our own advanced calculations.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planet formation occurs over a few Myr within protoplanetary discs of dust and gas, which are often assumed to evolve in isolation. However, extended gaseous structures have been uncovered around many protoplanetary discs, suggestive of late-stage in-fall from the interstellar medium (ISM). To quantify the prevalence of late-stage in-fall, we apply an excursion set formalism to track the local density and relative velocity of the ISM over the disc lifetime. We then combine the theoretical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion rate with a simple disc evolution model, anchoring stellar accretion time-scales to observational constraints. Disc lifetimes, as well as masses, stellar accretion rates and approximate gas radii as a function of stellar mass and age are remarkably well-reproduced by our simple model that includes only ISM accretion. If BHL accretion is the origin of the initial disc material, then $20{-}70$ percent of discs are mostly composed of material accreted in the most recent half of their lifetime, suggesting that disc properties are not a direct test of isolated evolution models. The ISM also deposits sufficient energy to drive observed turbulence in protoplanetary discs with viscous $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}- 10^{-1}$, although we emphasise that angular momentum transport may still be driven internal processes. Overall, our findings represent a compelling case for regulation of planet formation by galactic-scale turbulence, with broad consequences for planet formation theory. Our simple approach can be easily applied to semi-analytic models, and our results represent urgent motivation for an unbiased survey to confirm or refute our findings.</description>

      <title>The largest metallicity difference in twin systems: high-precision abundance analysis of the benchmark pair Krios &amp; Kronos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims.We conduct a high-precision differential abundance analysis of the remarkable binary system HD 240429/30 (Krios and Kronos, respectively), whose difference in metallicity is one of the highest detected in systems with similar components to date (approximately 0.20 dex). A condensation temperature TC trend study was performed to search for possible chemical signatures of planet formation. In addition, other potential scenarios have been proposed to explain this disparity. Methods. Fundamental atmospheric parameters (Te f f , log g, [Fe/H], vturb) were calculated using the latest version of the FUNDPAR code employing high resolution MAROON-X spectra. We applied a full line-by-line differential technique to measure the abundances of 26 elements in both stars with equivalent widths and spectral synthesis taking advantage of the non-solar scaled opacities. Results.We found a difference in metallicity of approximately 0.230 dex, being Kronos more metal rich than Krios. The analysis encompassed the examination of the diffusion effect and primordial chemical differences, concluding that the observed chemical discrepancies in the binary system cannot be solely attributed to any of these processes. The results also shown a noticeable excess of Li by approximately 0.56 dex in Kronos, and an enhancement of refractories with respect to Krios. A photometric study with TESS data was carried out, without finding any signal of possible transiting planets around the stars. Several potential planet formation scenarios were also explored to account for the observed excess in both metallicity and lithium in Kronos. Planetary engulfment is a plausible explanation, considering the ingestion of an exceptionally large mass, approximately approximately 27.8M_Earth, but no scenario is definitively ruled out.</description>
