      <title>Production and study of antideuterium with the GBAR beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of circulating antideuterons ($\mathrm{\overline{d}}$) in the AD/ELENA facility at CERN is currently under investigation. Approximately 100 $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ per bunch could be delivered as a $100\,\mathrm{keV}$ beam based on measured cross-sections. These $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ could be further decelerated to $12\,\mathrm{keV}$ using the GBAR scheme, enabling the synthesis of antideuterium ($\mathrm{\overline{D}}$) via charge exchange with positronium, a technique demonstrated with $6\,\mathrm{keV}$ antiprotons for antihydrogen production. While this would demonstrate the production of low-energy $\mathrm{\overline{D}}$, higher fluxes are required to facilitate spectroscopic studies. We propose enhancing the anti-atom production by using laser-excited positronium in the $2P$ state within a cavity, which is expected to increase the $\mathrm{\overline{D}}(2S)$ production cross-section by almost an order of magnitude for $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ with $2\,\mathrm{keV}$ energy. The ELENA team is currently studying the possibility of increasing the $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ rate using an optimized new target geometry. We present the projected precision for measuring the antideuterium Lamb shift and extracting the antideuteron charge radius, as a function of the beam flux.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen atom as a nonlinear oscillator under circularly polarized light: epicyclical electron orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use Clifford algebra $Cl_{2,0}$ to find the 2D orbit of Hydrogen electron under a Coulomb force and a perturbing circularly polarized electric field of light at angular frequency~$\omega$, which is turned on at time $t = 0$ via a unit step switch. Using a coordinate system co-rotating with the electron's unperturbed circular orbit at angular frequency $\omega_0$, we derive the complex nonlinear differential equation for the perturbation which is similar to but different from the Lorentz oscillator equation: (1) the acceleration terms are similar, (2) the damping term coefficient is not real but imaginary due to Coriolis force, (3) the term similar to spring force is not positive but negative, (3) there is a complex conjugate of the perturbation term which has no Lorentz analog but which makes the equation nonlinear, and (4) the angular frequency of the forcing term is not $\omega$ but $\omega - \omega_0$. By imposing that the position and velocity of the electron are continuous at time $t = 0$, we show that the orbit of the electron is a sum of five exponential Fourier terms with frequencies 0, $\omega_0$, $2\omega_0$, $(2\omega_0 - \omega)$, and $\omega$, which correspond to the eccentric, deferent, and three epicycles in Copernican astronomy. We show that at the three resonant light frequencies $0$, $\omega_0$, and $2\omega_0$, the electron's orbit is divergent, but approximates a Keplerian ellipse. At other light frequencies, the orbits are nondivergent with periods that are integer multiples of $\pi/\omega_0$ depending on the frequency ratio $\omega/\omega_0$. And as $\omega/\omega_0\rightarrow \pm\infty$, the orbit approaches the electron's unperturbed circular orbit.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum master equations for complete positivity: A direct approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum master equations (QMEs) are the primary workhorse in quantum information science, quantum optics, spectroscopy, and quantum thermodynamics, verifying complete positivity of the associated $N$-level quantum dynamical maps remains an outstanding challenge for $N\ge 3$. We address this challenge by establishing a direct mapping between the Liouvillian and Kossakowski matrices of an arbitrary Markovian QME. The mapping relies on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a rectangular matrix composed of the structure constants of SU$(N)$. As an application, we establish complete positivity of the quantum optical Bloch-Redfield QME for a three-level V-system driven by incoherent light. Our approach makes it possible to test QMEs for complete positivity without solving them, and to restore complete positivity by keeping only non-negative eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix.</description>

      <title>Stochastic evolution elasto-plastic modeling of a metallic glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a general data-driven approach to stochastic elastoplastic modelling that leverages atomistic simulation data directly rather than by fitting parameters. The approach is developed in the context of metallic glasses, which present inherent complexities due to their disordered structure. By harvesting statistics from simulated metallic glass shear response histories, the material state is mapped onto a two-dimensional state space consisting of the shear stress and the inelastic contribution to the potential energy. The resulting elastoplastic model is intrinsically stochastic and represented as a non-deterministic dynamical map. The state space statistics provide insights into the deformation physics of metallic glasses, revealing that two state variables are sufficient to describe the main features of the elastoplastic response. In this two-dimensional state space, the gradually quenched metallic glass rejuvenates during the initial quasi-elastic shearing, ultimately reaching a steady state that fluctuates about a fixed point in the state space as rejuvenation and aging balance.</description>

      <title>Orbital atomic sensor for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave science transforms research beyond general relativity and gravity. The signals detected not only reveal the nature of cataclysmic events and exotic objects in galaxies, but also test the models for the equation of state and color superconducting vortex alignment in neutron stars, as well as for the distribution of cosmological dark matter and their characteristic coupling with ordinary matter as new physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles. Measurement sensitivity is crucial to advance along those lines. One of the rapidly developing frontiers is quantum enhanced interferometry applied into the gravitational wave detectors. Progress achieved by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors brings exciting prospects. Here, we introduce an orbital atomic sensor using a squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate in an ultracold atomic optical lattice to project the gravitational wave signal received by a usual LIGO setup into a phase-sensitive entangled state. Simulation data show the detection sensitivity improves over the quantum noise of LIGO by approximately one order of magnitude in key frequency ranges. This advance enables about three-order-of-magnitude increase in detection volume, significantly advancing the potential of using gravitational waves to detect dark matter and black holes.</description>

      <title>Single-photon and multi-photon Fano lines for helium and neon using tRecX-haCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-photon and multi-photon ionization of helium and neon atoms by ultrashort extreme ultraviolet radiation is studied. The wavelength of radiation is chosen to excite a set of doubly excited states. We analyse the lineshapes arising from the presence of doubly excited states and numerically demonstrate the sensitivity of the Fano $q$ parameter to the order of multi-photon process. The computations were performed using the tRecX-haCC package developed by the authors. The tRecX-haCC package solves the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in the presence of a laser pulse and computes the photoelectron spectra including the narrow resonance peaks using the tSurff and iSurf techniques.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Properties of Indium Isotopes Elucidate the Doubly Magic Character of $^{100}$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of nuclear properties in the vicinity of $^{100}$Sn, suggested to be the heaviest doubly magic nucleus with equal numbers of protons (Z=50) and neutrons (N=50), has been a long-standing challenge for experimental and theoretical nuclear physics. Contradictory experimental evidence exists on the role of nuclear collectivity in this region of the nuclear chart. Using precision laser spectroscopy, we measured the ground-state electromagnetic moments of indium (Z=49) isotopes approaching the N=50 neutron number down to 101In, and nuclear charge radii of 101-131In spanning almost the complete range between the two major neutron closed-shells at N=50 and N=82. Our results for both nuclear charge radii and quadrupole moments reveal striking parabolic trends as a function of the neutron number, with a clear reduction toward these two neutron closed-shells, thus supporting a doubly magic character of $^{100}$Sn. Two complementary nuclear many-body frameworks, density functional theory and ab initio methods, elucidate our findings. A detailed comparison with our experimental results exposes deficiencies of nuclear models, establishing a benchmark for future theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>CPT and Lorentz symmetry tests with hydrogen using a novel in-beam hyperfine spectroscopy method applicable to antihydrogen experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Rabi-type measurement of two ground-state hydrogen hyperfine transitions performed in two opposite external magnetic field directions. This puts first constraints at the level of 2.3 10^-21 GeV on a set of coefficients of the Standard Model Extension, which were not measured by previous experiments. Moreover, we introduce a novel method, applicable to antihydrogen hyperfine spectroscopy in a beam, that determines the zero-field hyperfine transition frequency from the two transitions measured at the same magnetic field. Our value, nu_0 = 1.420 405 751 63(63) GHz, is in agreement with literature at a relative precision of 0.44 ppb. This is the highest precision achieved on hydrogen in a beam, improving over previous results by a factor of 6.</description>

      <title>A Rydberg atom based system for benchmarking mmWave automotive radar chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors and receivers have enabled sensitive and traceable measurements of RF fields at a wide range of frequencies. Here we demonstrate the detection of electric field amplitude in the extremely high frequency (EHF) band, at $131\ \mathrm{GHz}$. In our approach we propagate the EHF field in a beam, with control over its direction and polarization at the detector using photonic waveplates. This way, we take advantage of the highest detection sensitivity, registered for collinear propagation and circular polarization. To exhibit the potential for applications in this kind of Rydberg-atom based detection, we perform test measurements on the EHF field emitted from an on-chip radar, planned to be used in automotive industry as a vital sign detector. Our work elucidates practical applications of Rydberg-atom media as well as photonic metamaterial elements.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of strong coupling of a subradiant atom array to a cavity vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering linear scattering of cold atoms inside an undriven high-finesse optical resonator, we experimentally demonstrate effects unique to a strongly coupled vacuum field. Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice, with respect to the resonator mode, the scattering can be suppressed by destructive interference: resulting in a subradiant atomic array. We show however, that strong coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant polarization rotation in the linear scattering off the subradiant array via Raman scattering induced by the strongly coupled vacuum field.</description>
