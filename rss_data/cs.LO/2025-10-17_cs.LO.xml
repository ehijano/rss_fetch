      <title>T-BAT semantics and its logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{T-BAT} logic is a formal system designed to express the notion of informal provability. This type of provability is closely related to mathematical practice and is quite often contrasted with formal provability, understood as a formal derivation in an appropriate formal system. \textbf{T-BAT} is a non-deterministic four-valued logic. The logical values in \textbf{T-BAT} semantics convey not only the information whether a given formula is true but also about its provability status.
  The primary aim of our paper is to study the proposed four-valued non-deterministic semantics. We look into the intricacies of the interactions between various weakenings and strengthenings of the semantics with axioms that they induce. We prove the completeness of all the logics that are definable in this semantics by transforming truth values into specific expressions formulated within the object language of the semantics. Additionally, we utilize Kripke semantics to examine these axioms from a modal perspective by providing a frame condition that they induce. The secondary aim of this paper is to provide an intuitive axiomatization of \textbf{T-BAT} logic.</description>

      <title>Optimization Modulo Integer Linear-Exponential Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first study of the complexity of the optimization problem for integer linear-exponential programs which extend classical integer linear programs with the exponential function $x \mapsto 2^x$ and the remainder function ${(x,y) \mapsto (x \bmod 2^y)}$. The problem of deciding if such a program has a solution was recently shown to be NP-complete in [Chistikov et al., ICALP'24]. The optimization problem instead asks for a solution that maximizes (or minimizes) a linear-exponential objective function, subject to the constraints of an integer linear-exponential program. We establish the following results:
  1. If an optimal solution exists, then one of them can be succinctly represented as an integer linear-exponential straight-line program (ILESLP): an arithmetic circuit whose gates always output an integer value (by construction) and implement the operations of addition, exponentiation, and multiplication by rational numbers.
  2. There is an algorithm that runs in polynomial time, given access to an integer factoring oracle, which determines whether an ILESLP encodes a solution to an integer linear-exponential program. This algorithm can also be used to compare the values taken by the objective function on two given solutions.
  Building on these results, we place the optimization problem for integer linear-exponential programs within an extension of the optimization class $\text{NPO}$ that lies within $\text{FNP}^{\text{NP}}$. In essence, this extension forgoes determining the optimal solution via binary search.</description>

      <title>Problems and Consequences of Bilateral Notions of (Meta-)Derivability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bilateralist take on proof-theoretic semantics can be understood as demanding of a proof system to display not only rules giving the connectives' provability conditions but also their refutability conditions. On such a view, then, a system with two derivability relations is obtained, which can be quite naturally expressed in a proof system of natural deduction but which faces obstacles in a sequent calculus representation. Since in a sequent calculus there are two derivability relations inherent, one expressed by the sequent sign and one by the horizontal lines holding between sequents, in a truly bilateral calculus both need to be dualized. While dualizing the sequent sign is rather straightforwardly corresponding to dualizing the horizontal lines in natural deduction, dualizing the horizontal lines in sequent calculus, uncovers problems that, as will be argued in this paper, shed light on deeper conceptual issues concerning an imbalance between the notions of proof vs. refutation. The roots of this problem will be further analyzed and possible solutions on how to retain a bilaterally desired balance in our system are presented.</description>

      <title>Admissibility of Substitution Rule in Cyclic-Proof Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the admissibility of the substitution rule in cyclic-proof systems. The substitution rule complicates theoretical case analysis and increases computational cost in proof search since every sequent can be a conclusion of an instance of the substitution rule; hence, admissibility is desirable on both fronts. While admissibility is often shown by local proof transformations in non-cyclic systems, such transformations may disrupt cyclic structure and do not readily apply. Prior remarks suggested that the substitution rule is likely nonadmissible in the cyclic-proof system CLKID^omega for first-order logic with inductive predicates. In this paper, we prove admissibility in CLKID^omega, assuming the presence of the cut rule. Our approach unfolds a cyclic proof into an infinitary form, lifts the substitution rules, and places back edges to construct a cyclic proof without the substitution rule. If we restrict substitutions to exclude function symbols, the result extends to a broader class of systems, including cut-free CLKID^omega and cyclic-proof systems for the separation logic.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Continuous from the Discrete: an Infinite Tensor Product Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasingly in recent years, probabilistic computation has been investigated through the lenses of categorical algebra, especially via string diagrammatic calculi. Whereas categories of discrete and Gaussian probabilistic processes have been thoroughly studied, with various axiomatisation results, more expressive classes of continuous probability are less understood, because of the intrinsic difficulty of describing infinite behaviour by algebraic means.
  In this work, we establish a universal construction that adjoins infinite tensor products, allowing continuous probability to be investigated from discrete settings. Our main result applies this construction to $\mathsf{FinStoch}$, the category of finite sets and stochastic matrices, obtaining a category of locally constant Markov kernels, where the objects are finite sets plus the Cantor space $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. Any probability measure on the reals can be reasoned about in this category. Furthermore, we show how to lift axiomatisation results through the infinite tensor product construction. This way we obtain an axiomatic presentation of continuous probability over countable powers of $2=\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$.</description>

      <title>Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</description>

      <title>Simply-typed constant-domain modal lambda calculus I: distanced beta reduction and combinatory logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is developed that combines modal logic and simply-typed lambda calculus, and that generalizes the system studied by Montague and Gallin. Whereas Montague and Gallin worked with Church's simple theory of types, the system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is developed in the typed base theory most commonly used today, namely the simply-typed lambda calculus. Further, the system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is controlled by a parameter $\theta$ which allows more options for state types and state variables than is present in Montague and Gallin. A main goal of the paper is to establish the basic metatheory of $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$: (i) a completeness theorem is proven for $\beta\eta$-reduction, and (ii) an Andrews-like characterization of Henkin models in terms of combinatory logic is given; and this involves, with some necessity, a distanced version of $\beta$-reduction and a $\mathsf{BCKW}$-like basis rather than $\mathsf{SKI}$-like basis. Further, conservation of the maximal system $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ over $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is proven, and expressibility of $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ in $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\theta}$ is proven; thus these modal logics are highly expressive. Similar results are proven for the relation between $\boldsymbol\lambda_{\omega}$ and $\boldsymbol\lambda$, the corresponding ordinary simply-typed lambda calculus. This answers a question of Zimmermann in the simply-typed setting. In a companion paper this is extended to Church's simple theory of types.</description>

      <title>The memory of $\omega$-regular and BC($\Sigma_2^0$) objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of 2-player zero-sum infinite-duration games played on (potentially infinite) graphs, the memory of an objective is the smallest integer k such that in any game won by Eve, she has a strategy with &lt;= k states of memory. For omega-regular objectives, checking whether the memory equals a given number k was not known to be decidable. In this work, we focus on objectives in BC(Sigma0^2), i.e. recognised by a potentially infinite deterministic parity automaton. We provide a class of automata that recognise objectives with memory &lt;= k, leading to the following results: (1) For omega-regular objectives, the memory over finite and infinite games coincides and can be computed in NP. (2) Given two objectives W1 and W2 in BC(Sigma0^2) and assuming W1 is prefix-independent, the memory of W1 U W2 is at most the product of the memories of W1 and W2. Our results also apply to chromatic memory, the variant where strategies can update their memory state only depending on which colour is seen.</description>

      <title>Dilations and information flow axioms in categorical probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the positivity and causality axioms for Markov categories as properties of dilations and information flow in Markov categories, and in variations thereof for arbitrary semicartesian monoidal categories. These help us show that being a positive Markov category is merely an additional property of a symmetric monoidal category (rather than extra structure). We also characterize the positivity of representable Markov categories and prove that causality implies positivity, but not conversely. Finally, we note that positivity fails for quasi-Borel spaces and interpret this failure as a privacy property of probabilistic name generation.</description>

      <title>Strategy Templates for Almost-Sure and Positive Winning of Stochastic Parity Games towards Permissive and Resilient Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic games are fundamental in various applications, including the control of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where both controller and environment are modeled as players. Traditional algorithms typically aim to determine a single winning strategy to develop a controller. However, in CPS control and other domains, permissive controllers are essential, as they enable the system to adapt when additional constraints arise and remain resilient to runtime changes. This work generalizes the concept of (permissive winning) strategy templates, originally introduced by Anand et al. at TACAS and CAV 2023 for deterministic games, to incorporate stochastic games. These templates capture an infinite number of winning strategies, allowing for efficient strategy adaptation to system changes. We focus on two winning criteria (almost-sure and positive winning) and five winning objectives (safety, reachability, B\"uchi, co-B\"uchi, and parity). Our contributions include algorithms for constructing templates for each winning criterion and objective and a novel approach for extracting a winning strategy from a given template. Discussions on comparisons between templates and between strategy extraction methods are provided.</description>

      <title>Efficient &amp; Correct Predictive Equivalence for Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. The approach of McTavish et al. consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that the QM method may incorrectly decide predictive equivalence, if two key constraints are not respected, and one may be difficult to formally guarantee. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.</description>

      <title>Cubic Incompleteness: Hilbert's Tenth Problem Over $\mathbb{N}$ Starts at $\delta=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Hilbert's Tenth Problem over $\mathbb{N}$ remains undecidable when restricted to cubic equations (degree $\leq 3$), resolving the open case $\delta = 3$ identified by Jones (1982) and establishing sharpness against the decidability barrier at $\delta = 2$ (Lagrange's four-square theorem). For any consistent, recursively axiomatizable theory $T$ with G\"odel sentence $G_T$, we effectively construct a single polynomial $P(x_1, \ldots, x_m) \in \mathbb{Z}[\mathbf{x}]$ of degree $\leq 3$ such that $T \vdash G_T$ if and only if $\exists \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{N}^m : P(\mathbf{x}) = 0$.
  Our reduction proceeds through four stages with explicit degree and variable accounting. First, proof-sequence encoding via Diophantine $\beta$-function and Zeckendorf representation yields $O(KN)$ quadratic constraints, where $K = O(\log(\max_i f_i))$ and $N$ is the proof length. Second, axiom--modus ponens verification is implemented via guard-gadgets wrapping each base constraint $E(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ into the system $u \cdot E(\mathbf{x}) = 0$, $u - 1 - v^2 = 0$, maintaining degree $\leq 3$ while introducing $O(KN^3)$ variables and equations. Third, system aggregation via sum-of-squares merger $P_{\text{merged}} = \sum_{i} P_i^2$ produces a single polynomial of degree $\leq 6$ with $O(KN^3)$ monomials. Fourth, recursive monomial shielding factors each monomial of degree exceeding $3$ in $O(\log d)$ rounds via auxiliary variables and degree-$\leq 3$ equations, adding $O(K^3 N^3)$ variables and restoring degree $\leq 3$. We provide bookkeeping for every guard-gadget and merging operation, plus a unified stage-by-stage variable-count table. Our construction is effective and non-uniform in the uncomputable proof length $N$, avoiding any universal cubic equation. This completes the proof that the class of cubic Diophantine equations over $\mathbb{N}$ is undecidable.</description>
