      <title>Exploring EEG Indicators to Evaluate Listening Difficulties in Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory processing difficulties involve challenges in understanding speech in noisy environments despite normal hearing. However, the neural mechanisms remain unclear, and standardized diagnostic criteria are lacking. This study examined neural indicators using EEG under realistic noisy conditions. Ten Japanese-speaking university students participated in auditory tasks, including a resting state, a lecture attention task with background noise, and a task requiring attention to background noise. The study analyzed the peak frequency and power of alpha waves, the long-range temporal correlation of alpha oscillations, and the absolute power of delta waves. Results showed a significant reduction in the power of alpha waves during the background noise attention task, suggesting increased cognitive load. In contrast, the peak frequency of alpha waves remained stable, indicating limited sensitivity to cognitive demand changes. Long-range temporal correlation increased under tasks requiring auditory attention, reflecting sustained attention-related neural dynamics, while the absolute power of delta waves showed no significant variation across tasks. Regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the power of alpha waves in noisy conditions and screening scores for auditory processing difficulties, suggesting its potential as a neural indicator.</description>

      <title>Learning From the Past with Cascading Eligibility Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals often receive information about errors and rewards after a significant delay. For example, there is typically a delay of tens to hundreds of milliseconds between motor actions and visual feedback. The standard approach to handling delays in models of synaptic plasticity is to use eligibility traces. However, standard eligibility traces that decay exponentially mix together any events that happen during the delay, presenting a problem for any credit assignment signal that occurs with a significant delay. Here, we show that eligibility traces formed by a state-space model, inspired by a cascade of biochemical reactions, can provide a temporally precise memory for handling credit assignment at arbitrary delays. We demonstrate that these cascading eligibility traces (CETs) work for credit assignment at behavioral time-scales, ranging from seconds to minutes. As well, we can use CETs to handle extremely slow retrograde signals, as have been found in retrograde axonal signaling. These results demonstrate that CETs can provide an excellent basis for modeling synaptic plasticity.</description>

      <title>A Silent Speech Decoding System from EEG and EMG with Heterogenous Electrode Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silent speech decoding, which performs unvocalized human speech recognition from electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG), increases accessibility for speech-impaired humans. However, data collection is difficult and performed using varying experimental setups, making it nontrivial to collect a large, homogeneous dataset. In this study we introduce neural networks that can handle EEG/EMG with heterogeneous electrode placements and show strong performance in silent speech decoding via multi-task training on large-scale EEG/EMG datasets. We achieve improved word classification accuracy in both healthy participants (95.3%), and a speech-impaired patient (54.5%), substantially outperforming models trained on single-subject data (70.1% and 13.2%). Moreover, our models also show gains in cross-language calibration performance. This increase in accuracy suggests the feasibility of developing practical silent speech decoding systems, particularly for speech-impaired patients.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Learning of Brain Dynamics from fMRI Using Frequency-Specific Multi-Band Attention for Cognitive and Psychiatric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain's complex nonlinear dynamics give rise to cognitive function remains a central challenge in neuroscience. While brain functional dynamics exhibits scale-free and multifractal properties across temporal scales, conventional neuroimaging analytics assume linearity and stationarity, failing to capture frequency-specific neural computations. Here, we introduce Multi-Band Brain Net (MBBN), the first transformer-based framework to explicitly model frequency-specific spatiotemporal brain dynamics from fMRI. MBBN integrates biologically-grounded frequency decomposition with multi-band self-attention mechanisms, enabling discovery of previously undetectable frequency-dependent network interactions. Trained on 49,673 individuals across three large-scale cohorts (UK Biobank, ABCD, ABIDE), MBBN sets a new state-of-the-art in predicting psychiatric and cognitive outcomes (depression, ADHD, ASD), showing particular strength in classification tasks with up to 52.5\% higher AUROC and provides a novel framework for predicting cognitive intelligence scores. Frequency-resolved analyses uncover disorder-specific signatures: in ADHD, high-frequency fronto-sensorimotor connectivity is attenuated and opercular somatosensory nodes emerge as dynamic hubs; in ASD, orbitofrontal-somatosensory circuits show focal high-frequency disruption together with enhanced ultra-low-frequency coupling between the temporo-parietal junction and prefrontal cortex. By integrating scale-aware neural dynamics with deep learning, MBBN delivers more accurate and interpretable biomarkers, opening avenues for precision psychiatry and developmental neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Effective Stimulus Propagation in Neural Circuits: Driver Node Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.</description>

      <title>EEG2TEXT-CN: An Exploratory Study of Open-Vocabulary Chinese Text-EEG Alignment via Large Language Model and Contrastive Learning on ChineseEEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.</description>
