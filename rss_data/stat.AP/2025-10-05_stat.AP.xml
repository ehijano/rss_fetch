      <title>Typhoon Path Prediction Using Functional Data Analysis and Clustering-Based Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of typhoon trajectories is essential for mitigating the impact of these extreme weather events. This study proposes a functional data analysis (FDA) framework for modeling and forecasting typhoon paths using historical trajectory data. Latitude and longitude sequences are represented as smooth functional observations, and a function-on-function regression model is employed to capture the temporal dynamics of typhoon movement. While the baseline model demonstrates reasonable performance for typical bow-shaped trajectories, it exhibits limited accuracy for non-standard paths. To address this limitation, a clustering-based extension is introduced, wherein typhoons are grouped by trajectory shape prior to regression. This two-stage approach improves predictive accuracy by enabling localized modeling adapted to structural variations in the data. The results demonstrate the practical utility of combining FDA with clustering for robust and flexible typhoon trajectory forecasting.</description>

      <title>Model Falsification for Predicting Dynamical Responses of Uncertain Structural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of dynamical response of structural system depends on the correct modeling of that system. However, modeling becomes increasingly challenging when there are many candidate models available to describe the system behavior. Furthermore, uncertainties can be present even for the parameters of these model classes. The plausibility of each input-output model class of the structures with uncertain components can be determined by a Bayesian approach from measured dynamic responses to one or more input records; predictions of the structural system response to alternate input records can then be made. However, this approach may require many model simulations, even though most of those model classes are quite implausible. An approach is proposed herein to use a bound, computed from the false discovery rate, on the likelihood of measured data to falsify models considering uncertainties in the passive control devices that do not reproduce the measured data to sufficient accuracy. Response prediction is then performed using the unfalsified models in an approximate Bayesian sense by assigning weights, computed from the likelihoods, only to the unfalsified models approach incurring only a fraction of the computational cost of the standard Bayesian approach. The proposed approach for response prediction is illustrated using three structural examples: an earthquake-excited four--degree-of-freedom building model with a hysteretic isolation layer; a 1623--degree-of-freedom three-dimensional building model, with tuned mass dampers attached to its roof, subjected to wind loads; and a full-scale four-story base-isolated building tested on world's largest shake table in Japan's E-Defense lab. The results exhibit accurate response predictions and significant computational savings, thereby illustrating the potential of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the influence of demographic factors on the treatment of pediatric patients in the emergency department</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent demographic disparities have been identified in the treatment of patients seeking care in the emergency department (ED). These may be driven in part by subconscious biases, which providers themselves may struggle to identify. To better understand the operation of these biases, we performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using electronic health records describing 339,400 visits to the ED of a single US pediatric medical center between 2019-2024. Odds ratios were calculated using propensity-score matching. Analyses were adjusted for confounding variables, including chief complaint, insurance type, socio-economic deprivation, and patient comorbidities. We also trained a machine learning [ML] model on this dataset to identify predictors of admission. We found significant demographic disparities in admission (Non-Hispanic Black [NHB] relative to Non-Hispanic White [NHW]: OR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.73-0.81; Hispanic relative to NHW: OR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.76-0.83). We also identified disparities in individual decisions taken during the ED stay. For example, NHB patients were significantly less likely than NHW patients to be assigned an `emergent' triage acuity score of (OR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.67-0.72), but emergent NHB patients were also significantly less likely to be admitted than NHW patients with the same triage acuity (OR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.80-0.93). Demographic disparities were particularly acute wherever patients had normal vital signs, public insurance, moderate socio-economic deprivation, or a home address distant from the hospital. An ML model assigned higher importance to triage score for NHB than NHW patients when predicting admission, reflecting these disparities in assignment. We conclude that many visit characteristics, clinical and otherwise, may influence the operation of subconscious biases and affect ML-driven decision support tools.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Bed Occupancy Planning in Intensive Care Units Using $M_t/G_t/\infty$ Queueing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hospitals struggle to make effective long-term capacity planning decisions for intensive care units (ICUs) under uncertainty in future demand. Admission rates fluctuate over time due to temporal factors, and length of stay (LOS) distributions vary with patient heterogeneity, hospital location, case mix, and clinical practices. Common planning approaches rely on steady-state queueing models or heuristic rules that assume fixed parameters, but these methods often fall short in capturing real-world occupancy dynamics. One widely used example is the 85\% occupancy rule, which recommends maintaining average utilization below this level to ensure responsiveness; however, this rule is based on stationary assumptions and may be unreliable when applied to time-varying systems. Our analysis shows that even when long-run utilization targets are met, day-to-day occupancy frequently exceeds 100\% capacity.
  We propose a data-driven framework for estimating ICU bed occupancy using an $M_t/G_t/\infty$ queueing model, which incorporates time-varying arrival rates and empirically estimated LOS distributions. The framework combines statistical decomposition and parametric distribution fitting to capture temporal patterns in ICU admissions and LOS. We apply it to multi-year data from neonatal ICUs (NICUs) in Calgary as a case study. Several capacity planning scenarios are evaluated, including average-based thresholds and surge estimates from Poisson overflow approximations. Results demonstrate the inadequacy of static heuristics in environments with fluctuating demand and highlight the importance of modeling LOS variability when estimating bed needs. Although the case study focuses on NICUs, the methodology generalizes to other ICU settings and provides interpretable, data-informed support for healthcare systems facing rising demand and limited capacity.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation with Autoregressive Tiling for Detecting Objects in Astronomical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution images of the night sky, providing information about billions of stars and galaxies. Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images is a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these objects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an amortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of small-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially autoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent space according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the conditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the posterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior estimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure greatly improves posterior calibration.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of VaR Models: Historical Simulation, GARCH-Based Monte Carlo, and Filtered Historical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of three Value-at-Risk (VaR) modeling approaches: Historical Simulation (HS), GARCH with Normal approximation (GARCH-N), and GARCH with Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS), using both in-sample and multi-day forecasting frameworks. We compute daily 5 percent VaR estimates using each method and assess their accuracy via empirical breach frequencies and visual breach indicators. Our findings reveal severe miscalibration in the HS and GARCH-N models, with empirical breach rates far exceeding theoretical levels. In contrast, the FHS method consistently aligns with theoretical expectations and exhibits desirable statistical and visual behavior. We further simulate 5-day cumulative returns under both GARCH-N and GARCH-FHS frameworks to compute multi-period VaR and Expected Shortfall. Results show that GARCH-N underestimates tail risk due to its reliance on the Gaussian assumption, whereas GARCH-FHS provides more robust and conservative tail estimates. Overall, the study demonstrates that the GARCH-FHS model offers superior performance in capturing fat-tailed risks and provides more reliable short-term risk forecasts.</description>

      <title>Alzheimer's Clinical Research Data via R Packages: the alzverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharing clinical research data is essential for advancing research in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other therapeutic areas. However, challenges in data accessibility, standardization, documentation, usability, and reproducibility continue to impede this goal. In this article, we highlight the advantages of using R packages to overcome these challenges using two examples. The A4LEARN R package includes data from a randomized trial (the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's [A4] study) and its companion observational study of biomarker negative individuals (the Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration [LEARN] study). The ADNIMERGE2 R package includes data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a longitudinal observational biomarker and imaging study. These packages collect data, documentation, and reproducible analysis vignettes into a portable bundle that can be installed and browsed within commonly used R programming environments. We also introduce the alzverse package which leverages a common data standard to combine study-specific data packages to facilitate meta-analyses. By promoting collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility, R data packages can play a vital role in accelerating clinical research.</description>

      <title>Apply Bayes Theorem to Optimize IVR Authentication Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to improve Interactive Voice Response (IVR) authentication processes used by financial institutions. Traditional IVR systems authenticate users through a static sequence of credentials, assuming uniform effectiveness among them. However, fraudsters exploit this predictability, selectively bypassing strong credentials. This study applies Bayes' Theorem and conditional probability modeling to evaluate fraud risk dynamically and adapt credential verification paths.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information-Driven Visualization and Clustering for Core KPI Selection in O-RAN Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: O-RAN testing is becoming increasingly difficult with the exponentially growing number of performance measurements as the system grows more complex, with additional units, interfaces, applications, and possible implementations and configurations. To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design for O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various performance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled as realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized as a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust estimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains challenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual Information in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information (DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is applied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among various performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core'' performance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics, organically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and yields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN testing.</description>
