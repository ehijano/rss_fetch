      <title>Energy partition between splitting fission fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the microscopic view, the energy partition between two fission fragments are associated with the splitting of wave functions of an entangled fissioning system, in contrast to most fission models using an explicit statistical partition of excitation energies by invoking level densities of fragments. The dynamical fission evolution is described within the time-dependent Hartree-Fock+BCS framework. Excitation energies of isotopic fission fragments are obtained with the particle-number projection method after the dynamical splitting of $^{238}$U. The resulting excitation energies of light and heavy fragments illustrate the appearance of sawtooth structures. We find that the paring strengths have significant influences on the partition of excitation energies. Furthermore, excitation energies of isotopic fragments increase with increasing neutron numbers, suppressing the production of neutron-rich beams in rare-isotope beam facilities.</description>

      <title>Novel way of evaluating $g_A$ quenching in $\beta^+$/EC decays : Introducing the Branching-Ratio Method (BRM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel Branching-Ratio Method (BRM) for the determination of effective value $g_{\rm A}^{\rm eff}$ of the weak axial coupling $g_{\rm A}$ for forbidden non-unique (FNU) $\beta^+$/electron-capture(EC) decays is introduced. The method offers new possibilities for testing the fitness of nuclear Hamiltonians in modeling the physics of complex $\beta^+$/EC decays. The constraint of simultaneously reproducing the branching to $\beta^+$ and EC transitions offers an additional constraint in tackling the problem of $g_{\rm A}^{\rm eff}$ determination. In the BRM the ambiguity in the choice of the values of $g_{\rm A}^{\rm eff}$ and s-NME (small relativistic vector nuclear matrix element) is lifted when constraints of the branching ratios of $\beta^+$ and EC decays are applied. As an example, in the present work we apply BRM to the case of second FNU $\beta^+$/EC decay of $^{59}$Ni.This decay is treated with three different nuclear shell-model (NSM) Hamiltonians demonstrating the effects of different nuclear-structure aspects in application of the BRM.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Heavy Quarks in Strongly Coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the probability distribution $P({\bf k})$ for a heavy quark with velocity $v$ propagating through strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma in the 't Hooft limit at a temperature $T$ to acquire a momentum ${\bf k}$ due to interactions with the plasma. This distribution encodes the well-known drag coefficient $\eta_D$ and the transverse and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Furthermore, our calculation determines all of the higher order and mixed moments to leading order in $1/\sqrt{\lambda}$ for the first time. These non-Gaussian features of $P({\bf k})$ include qualitatively novel correlations between longitudinal energy loss and transverse momentum broadening at nonzero $v$. We demonstrate that these non-Gaussian characteristics can be sizable in magnitude and even dominant in physically relevant situations. We use these results to derive a Kolmogorov equation for the evolution of the probability distribution for the total momentum of a heavy quark that propagates through strongly coupled plasma. This evolution equation accounts for all higher order correlations between transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal energy loss, which we have calculated from first principles. It reduces to a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation when truncated to only include the effects of $\eta_D$, $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Remarkably, while heavy quarks do not reach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma if evolved with this FP equation, we demonstrate that heavy quarks do reach kinetic equilibrium if evolved with the all-order Kolmogorov equation we have derived. Our results thus provide a dynamically complete framework for understanding the thermalization of a heavy quark that may be initially far from equilibrium in the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma -- as well as new insight into heavy quark transport and equilibration in quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Transition balance in QCD nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an extended and more complete version of the primary QCD nucleation model presented in Ref. [1], the new model introduces explicitly the transition balance and formulates it in both macroscopic and microscopic descriptions. The microscopic description of the transition balance in QCD nucleation is implemented in a kinetic parton cascade model and tested for a first-order phase transition from gluons to pions in a one-dimensional expansion with Bjorken boost invariance.</description>

      <title>Systematic uncertainties from higher-twist corrections in DIS at large $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the systematic uncertainties and potential biases arising from the inclusion of large-$x$ corrections to proton and deuteron DIS data in global QCD analyses. Using the CTEQ-JLab framework, we examine various approaches to implementing higher-twist corrections in nucleon structure functions and off-shell PDF modifications in deuteron targets. We analyze how these components interact and influence the determination of the $d$-quark PDF and the neutron structure function at large $x$. We find that it is very important to consider isospin-dependent higher-twist corrections in order to minimize implementation biases in the extracted quantities.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the magnetic field for the stable strange quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasiparticle model is employed to investigate the quark matter at finite chemical potential. The effective bag constant is derived to be dependent on both the chemical potential and the magnetic field. The self-consistent thermodynamics is fulfilled that the free energy minimum corresponds to the zero pressure. It is shown that the strong magnetic field is helpful for the stabilization of the strange quark matter. However, the increase in the coupling constant and the vacuum bag constant could reduce the stability. For the absolutely stable strange quark matter, there is a lower limit of the allowed magnetic field, which rises with the increase in the coupling constant and the vacuum bag constant.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark matter distribution on neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and observable impacts of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars using a combined equation of state that integrates the relativistic mean field (RMF) model for baryonic matter with a variable density profile for DM, incorporating DM-baryon interactions mediated by the Higgs field. Employing three RMF parameter sets (NL3, BigApple, and IOPB-I) for baryonic matter, we analyze mass-radius relations, maximum mass, and tidal deformability, focusing on DM density scaling ($\alpha$) and steepness ($\beta$) parameters. Our findings reveal that increased DM concentration significantly enhances NS compactness, shifting mass-radius profiles and reducing tidal deformability. The DM influence strongly depends on the steepness of the DM density profile, where high $\beta$ values lead to strongly confined DM within the NS core, resulting in more compact and less deformable configurations. Observational constraints from PSR J0740+6620 and GW170817 impose consistent structural limits on DM fractions across different equations of state models, narrowing the allowable parameter space for DM and linking specific combinations of $\alpha M_{\chi}$ ($M_{\chi}$ being the mass of dark matter particle) and $\beta$ values to viable NS structures. This study highlights the interplay among DM concentration, nuclear stiffness, and observational data in shaping NS structure, offering insights into future constraints on DM in high-density astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Test for universality of short-range correlations in pion-induced Drell-Yan Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear modification and the universality of short-range correlation (SRC) in pion-induced Drell-Yan process. Employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and pion PDFs, the ratio of differential cross sections of different nuclei relative to the free nucleon is presented. A kind of universal modification function was proposed which would provide nontrivial tests of SRC universality on the platform of pion-induced Drell-Yan. This work improves our understanding of nuclear structure and strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Effects of inner crusts on $g$-mode oscillations in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the influence of neutron stars' crusts on the non-radial $g$-mode oscillations and examine their correlations with nuclear matter properties fixed by adopting 10 different relativistic density functionals. At subsaturation densities, neutron star matter takes non-uniform structures and form the crusts. We find that the Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} (BV) frequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip density (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode oscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density functional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the core-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode oscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally increase with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually intersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This leads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass contributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global $g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\gtrsim 1.4\ M_{\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave observations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in density or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation, magnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play important roles.</description>

      <title>Dominance of Electric Fields in the Charge Splitting of Elliptic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of electromagnetic fields, highlighting the dominant effect of electric fields on the splitting of elliptic flow, \( \Delta v_2 \) with transverse momentum ($p_T$). The velocity and temperature profiles of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described through thermal model calculations. The electromagnetic field evolution is however determined from the solutions of Maxwell's equations, assuming constant electric and chiral conductivities. We find that the slower decay of the electric fields compared to the magnetic fields makes its impact on the splitting of the elliptic flow more dominant. We further estimated that the maximum value of \( |\langle eF \rangle| \), evaluated by averaging the field values over all spatial points on the hypersurface and across all field components, is approximately \( (0.010003 \pm 0.000195) \, m_{\pi}^2 \) for \( \sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 7.7 \, \text{GeV} \), which could describe the splitting of elliptic flow data within the current experimental uncertainty reasonably well.</description>

Abstract: We determine the uncorrelated modes that characterize the fluctuations in a semi-realistic model for the initial state of high-energy nuclear collisions, consisting of hot spots whose positions are distributed independently. Varying the number of hot spots, their size, and the weights with which they contribute to the initial state, we find that the parameter that has the largest influence on the relative importance of the fluctuation modes is the source size, with more extended hot spots leading to a more marked predominance of the principal modes.</description>

      <title>Mean-field approximation on steroids: exact description of the deuteron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article demonstrates that the deuteron, i.e. the lightest bound nuclear system made of a single proton and a single neutron, can be accurately described within a mean-field-based framework.
  Although paradoxical at first glance, the deuteron ground-state binding energy, magnetic dipole moment, electric quadrupole moment and root-mean-square proton radius are indeed reproduced with sub-percent accuracy via a low-dimensional linear combination of non-orthogonal Bogoliubov states, i.e. with a method whose numerical cost scales as $n_{\text{dim}}^4$, where $n_{\text{dim}}$ is the dimension of the basis of the one-body Hilbert space. By further putting the system into a harmonic trap, the neutron-proton scattering length and effective range in the ${}^{3}S_1$ channel are also accurately reproduced.
  To achieve this task, (i) the inclusion of proton-neutron pairing through the mixing of proton and neutron single-particle states in the Bogoliubov transformation and (ii) the restoration of proton and neutron numbers before variation are shown to be mandatory ingredients.
  This unexpected result has implications regarding the most efficient way to capture necessary correlations as a function of nuclear mass and regarding the possibility to ensure order-by-order renormalizability of many-body calculations based on chiral or pionless effective field theories beyond light nuclei. In this context, the present study will be extended to $^{3}$H and $^{3,4}$He in the near future as well as to the leading order of pionless effective field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a chiral effective field theory-based approach to connect $DD^*$ scattering observables at the physical and variable pion masses accessible in lattice QCD simulations. We incorporate all relevant scales associated with three-body $DD\pi$ dynamics and the left-hand cut induced by the one-pion exchange for pion masses higher than the physical one, as required by analyticity and unitarity. By adjusting the contact interactions to match experimental data at the physical pion mass and lattice finite-volume energy levels at $m_{\pi} = 280$ MeV, we predict the trajectory of the $T_{cc}$ pole as a function of the pion mass, finding it consistent with the hadronic-molecule scenario. In particular, we find that the explicit treatment of the one-pion exchange has a pronounced effect on the pole trajectory for $m_\pi \gtrsim 230$ MeV by pushing it into the complex energy plane.</description>
