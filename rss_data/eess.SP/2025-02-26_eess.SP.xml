      <title>Propagation Measurements and Modeling for Low Altitude UAVs From 1 to 24 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most countries, small (&lt;2 kg) and medium (&lt;25 kg) size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must fly at low altitude, below 120 m, and with permanent radio communications with ground for control and telemetry. These communications links can be provided using 4G/5G networks or dedicated links, but in either this case the communications can be significantly degraded by frequent Non Line of Sight (NLoS) propagation. In this case, reflection and diffraction from ground objects are critical to maintain links, and hence accurate propagation models for this must be considered. In this letter we present a model for path loss when the UAV is flying in NLOS conditions. The study is based on measurements made at frequencies of 1, 4, 12, and 24 GHz with a UAV flying in a suburban environment. Measurements have been used to model NLOS propagation below 4 GHz, where the dominant mechanism is diffraction, and above 4GHzwhere multipath is the dominant propagationmechanism. The model can be of use in predicting excess losses when UAVs fly in suburban NLOS conditions.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Dual-Filter Fuzzy Neural Networks for Affective Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy logic provides a robust framework for enhancing explainability, particularly in domains requiring the interpretation of complex and ambiguous signals, such as brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Despite significant advances in deep learning, interpreting human emotions remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we present iFuzzyAffectDuo, a novel computational model that integrates a dual-filter fuzzy neural network architecture for improved detection and interpretation of emotional states from neuroimaging data. The model introduces a new membership function (MF) based on the Laplace distribution, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches. By refining the extraction of neural signals associated with specific emotions, iFuzzyAffectDuo offers a human-understandable framework that unravels the underlying decision-making processes. We validate our approach across three neuroimaging datasets using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalography (EEG), demonstrating its potential to advance affective computing. These findings open new pathways for understanding the neural basis of emotions and their application in enhancing human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>DCentNet: Decentralized Multistage Biomedical Signal Classification using Early Exits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DCentNet is a novel decentralized multistage signal classification approach designed for biomedical data from IoT wearable sensors, integrating early exit points (EEP) to enhance energy efficiency and processing speed. Unlike traditional centralized processing methods, which result in high energy consumption and latency, DCentNet partitions a single CNN model into multiple sub-networks using EEPs. By introducing encoder-decoder pairs at EEPs, the system compresses large feature maps before transmission, significantly reducing wireless data transfer and power usage. If an input is confidently classified at an EEP, processing stops early, optimizing efficiency. Initial sub-networks can be deployed on fog or edge devices to further minimize energy consumption. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize EEP placement, balancing performance and complexity. Experimental results on ECG classification show that with one EEP, DCentNet reduces wireless data transmission by 94.54% and complexity by 21%, while maintaining original accuracy and sensitivity. With two EEPs, sensitivity reaches 98.36%, accuracy 97.74%, wireless data transmission decreases by 91.86%, and complexity is reduced by 22%. Implemented on an ARM Cortex-M4 MCU, DCentNet achieves an average power saving of 73.6% compared to continuous wireless ECG transmission.</description>

      <title>AirTag, You're It: Reverse Logistics and Last Mile Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses challenges in reverse logistics, a frequently overlooked but essential component of last-mile delivery, particularly in disaster relief scenarios where infrastructure disruptions demand adaptive solutions. While hub-and-spoke logistics networks excel at long-distance scalability, they often fail to optimize closely spaced spokes reliant on distant hubs, introducing inefficiencies in transit times and resource allocation. Using 20 Apple AirTags embedded in packages, this research provides empirical insights into logistical flows, capturing granular spatial and temporal data through Bluetooth LE (BLE) 5 trackers integrated with the Apple Find My network. These trackers demonstrated their value in monitoring dynamic cargo movements, enabling real-time adjustments in mobile hub placement and route optimization, particularly in disaster relief contexts like Hurricane Helene. A novel application of discrete event simulation (DES) further explored the saddle point in hub-spoke configurations, where excessive hub reliance clashes with diminishing spoke interaction demand. By coupling simulation results with empirical AirTag tracking, the study highlights the potential of BLE technology to refine reverse logistics, reduce delays, and improve operational flexibility in both routine and crisis-driven delivery networks.</description>

      <title>Smart Sampling Strategies for Wireless Industrial Data Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industrial environments, data acquisition accuracy is crucial for process control and optimization. Wireless telemetry has proven to be a valuable tool for improving efficiency in well-testing operations, enabling bidirectional communication and real-time control of downhole tools. However, high sampling frequencies present challenges in telemetry, including data storage, transmission, computational resource consumption, and battery life of wireless devices. This study explores how optimizing data acquisition strategies can reduce aliasing effects and systematic errors while improving sampling rates without compromising measurement accuracy. A reduction of 80% in sampling frequency was achieved without degrading measurement quality, demonstrating the potential for resource optimization in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>MoEMba: A Mamba-based Mixture of Experts for High-Density EMG-based Hand Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Density surface Electromyography (HDsEMG) has emerged as a pivotal resource for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), offering direct insights into muscle activities and motion intentions. However, a significant challenge in practical implementations of HD-sEMG-based models is the low accuracy of inter-session and inter-subject classification. Variability between sessions can reach up to 40% due to the inherent temporal variability of HD-sEMG signals. Targeting this challenge, the paper introduces the MoEMba framework, a novel approach leveraging Selective StateSpace Models (SSMs) to enhance HD-sEMG-based gesture recognition. The MoEMba framework captures temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions through channel attention techniques. Furthermore, wavelet feature modulation is integrated to capture multi-scale temporal and spatial relations, improving signal representation. Experimental results on the CapgMyo HD-sEMG dataset demonstrate that MoEMba achieves a balanced accuracy of 56.9%, outperforming its state-of-the-art counterparts. The proposed framework's robustness to session-to-session variability and its efficient handling of high-dimensional multivariate time series data highlight its potential for advancing HD-sEMG-powered HCI systems.</description>

      <title>Study on Downlink CSI compression: Are Neural Networks the Only Solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) systems enable higher data rates in the downlink (DL) with spatial multiplexing achieved by forming narrow beams. The higher DL data rates are achieved by effective implementation of spatial multiplexing and beamforming which is subject to availability of DL channel state information (CSI) at the base station. For Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems, the DL CSI has to be transmitted by User Equipment (UE) to the gNB and it constitutes a significant overhead which scales with the number of transmitter antennas and the granularity of the CSI. To address the overhead issue, AI/ML methods using auto-encoders have been investigated, where an encoder neural network model at the UE compresses the CSI and a decoder neural network model at the gNB reconstructs it. However, the use of AI/ML methods has a number of challenges related to (1) model complexity, (2) model generalization across channel scenarios and (3) inter-vendor compatibility of the two sides of the model. In this work, we investigate a more traditional dimensionality reduction method that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and therefore does not suffer from the above challenges. Simulation results show that PCA based CSI compression actually achieves comparable reconstruction performance to commonly used deep neural networks based models.</description>

      <title>Finetuning and Quantization of EEG-Based Foundational BioSignal Models on ECG and PPG Data for Blood Pressure Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) is a key indicator of cardiovascular health. As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5x the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5x (from 13.73 MB down to 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.</description>

      <title>The Case for Cleaner Biosignals: High-fidelity Neural Compressor Enables Transfer from Cleaner iEEG to Noisier EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All data modalities are not created equal, even when the signal they measure comes from the same source. In the case of the brain, two of the most important data modalities are the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), and the intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). They are used by human experts, supported by deep learning (DL) models, to accomplish a variety of tasks, such as seizure detection and motor imagery classification. Although the differences between EEG and iEEG are well understood by human experts, the performance of DL models across these two modalities remains under-explored. To help characterize the importance of clean data on the performance of DL models, we propose BrainCodec, a high-fidelity EEG and iEEG neural compressor. We find that training BrainCodec on iEEG and then transferring to EEG yields higher reconstruction quality than training on EEG directly. In addition, we also find that training BrainCodec on both EEG and iEEG improves fidelity when reconstructing EEG. Our work indicates that data sources with higher SNR, such as iEEG, provide better performance across the board also in the medical time-series domain. BrainCodec also achieves up to a 64x compression on iEEG and EEG without a notable decrease in quality. BrainCodec markedly surpasses current state-of-the-art compression models both in final compression ratio and in reconstruction fidelity. We also evaluate the fidelity of the compressed signals objectively on a seizure detection and a motor imagery task performed by standard DL models. Here, we find that BrainCodec achieves a reconstruction fidelity high enough to ensure no performance degradation on the downstream tasks. Finally, we collect the subjective assessment of an expert neurologist, that confirms the high reconstruction quality of BrainCodec in a realistic scenario. The code is available at https://github.com/IBM/eeg-ieeg-brain-compressor.</description>

      <title>SincPD: An Explainable Method based on Sinc Filters to Diagnose Parkinson's Disease Severity by Gait Cycle Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an explainable deep learning-based classifier based on adaptive sinc filters for Parkinson's Disease diagnosis (PD) along with determining its severity, based on analyzing the gait cycle (SincPD) is presented. Considering the effects of PD on the gait cycle of patients, the proposed method utilizes raw data in the form of vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) measured by wearable sensors placed in soles of subjects' shoes. The proposed method consists of Sinc layers that model adaptive bandpass filters to extract important frequency-bands in gait cycle of patients along with healthy subjects. Therefore, by considering these frequencies, the reasons behind the classification a person as a patient or healthy can be explained. In this method, after applying some preprocessing processes, a large model equipped with many filters is first trained. Next, to prune the extra units and reach a more explainable and parsimonious structure, the extracted filters are clusters based on their cut-off frequencies using a centroid-based clustering approach. Afterward, the medoids of the extracted clusters are considered as the final filters. Therefore, only 15 bandpass filters for each sensor are derived to classify patients and healthy subjects. Finally, the most effective filters along with the sensors are determined by comparing the energy of each filter encountering patients and healthy subjects.</description>

      <title>Large Cognition Model: Towards Pretrained EEG Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography provides a non-invasive window into brain activity, offering valuable insights for neurological research, brain-computer interfaces, and clinical diagnostics. However, the development of robust machine learning models for EEG analysis is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets and the inherent variability of EEG signals across subjects and recording conditions. Inspired by the success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision, we propose the Large Cognition Model-a transformer-based foundation model designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and downstream tasks. Unlike traditional approaches, our proposed transformer-based architecture demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across datasets and tasks, even without pretraining, surpassing some existing EEG universal models on specific downstream applications. LCM leverages large-scale self-supervised learning techniques to capture universal EEG representations, enabling efficient fine-tuning for applications such as cognitive state decoding, disease classification, and neurofeedback systems. We introduce a novel architecture that integrates temporal and spectral attention mechanisms, optimizing the model's ability to extract meaningful features from raw EEG signals. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LCM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple EEG benchmarks, exhibiting strong cross-subject and cross-task generalization. Our findings highlight the potential of pretrained EEG foundation models to accelerate advancements in neuroscience, personalized medicine, and BCI technology.</description>

      <title>Bridging Brain Signals and Language: A Deep Learning Approach to EEG-to-Text Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain activity translation into human language delivers the capability to revolutionize machine-human interaction while providing communication support to people with speech disability. Electronic decoding reaches a certain level of achievement yet current EEG-to-text decoding methods fail to reach open vocabularies and depth of meaning and individual brain-specific variables. We introduce a special framework which changes conventional closed-vocabulary EEG-to-text decoding approaches by integrating subject-specific learning models with natural language processing methods to resolve detection obstacles. This method applies a deep representation learning approach to extract important EEG features which allow training of neural networks to create elaborate sentences that extend beyond original data content. The ZuCo dataset analysis demonstrates that research findings achieve higher BLEU, ROUGE and BERTScore performance when compared to current methods. The research proves how this framework functions as an effective approach to generate meaningful and correct texts while understanding individual brain variations. The proposed research aims to create a connection between open-vocabulary Text generation systems and human brain signal interpretation for developing efficacious brain-to-text systems. The research produces interdisciplinary effects through innovative assistive technology development and personalized communication systems which extend possibilities for human-computer interaction in various settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm represents a promising application of electroencephalography (EEG) in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. However, cross-subject variability remains a critical challenge, particularly for BCI-illiterate users who struggle to effectively interact with these systems. To address this issue, we propose the Class-Sensitive Subject-to-Subject Semantic Style Transfer Network (CSSSTN), which incorporates a class-sensitive approach to align feature distributions between golden subjects (BCI experts) and target (BCI-illiterate) users on a class-by-class basis. Building on the SSSTN framework, CSSSTN incorporates three key components: (1) subject-specific classifier training, (2) a unique style loss to transfer class-discriminative features while preserving semantic information through a modified content loss, and (3) an ensemble approach to integrate predictions from both source and target domains. We evaluated CSSSTN using both a publicly available dataset and a self-collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that CSSSTN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean balanced accuracy improvements of 6.4\% on the Tsinghua dataset and 3.5\% on the HDU dataset, with notable benefits for BCI-illiterate users. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component, particularly the class-sensitive transfer and the use of lower-layer features, which enhance transfer performance and mitigate negative transfer. Additionally, CSSSTN achieves competitive results with minimal target data, reducing calibration time and effort. These findings highlight the practical potential of CSSSTN for real-world BCI applications, offering a robust and scalable solution to improve the performance of BCI-illiterate users while minimizing reliance on extensive training data.

      <title>PixleepFlow: A Pixel-Based Lifelog Framework for Predicting Sleep Quality and Stress Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of lifelogs can yield valuable insights into an individual's daily life, particularly with regard to their health and well-being. The accurate assessment of quality of life is necessitated by the use of diverse sensors and precise synchronization. To rectify this issue, this study proposes the image-based sleep quality and stress level estimation flow (PixleepFlow). PixleepFlow employs a conversion methodology into composite image data to examine sleep patterns and their impact on overall health. Experiments were conducted using lifelog datasets to ascertain the optimal combination of data formats. In addition, we identified which sensor information has the greatest influence on the quality of life through Explainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI). As a result, PixleepFlow produced more significant results than various data formats. This study was part of a written-based competition, and the additional findings from the lifelog dataset are detailed in Section Section IV. More information about PixleepFlow can be found at https://github.com/seongjiko/Pixleep.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep profoundly affects our health, and sleep deficiency or disorders can cause physical and mental problems. % Despite significant findings from previous studies, challenges persist in optimizing deep learning models, especially in multi-modal learning for high-accuracy sleep stage classification. Our research introduces MC2SleepNet (Multi-modal Cross-masking with Contrastive learning for Sleep stage classification Network). It aims to facilitate the effective collaboration between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures for multi-modal training with the help of contrastive learning and cross-masking. % Raw single channel EEG signals and corresponding spectrogram data provide differently characterized modalities for multi-modal learning. Our MC2SleepNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of both 84.6% on the SleepEDF-78 and 88.6% accuracy on the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). These results demonstrate the effective generalization of our proposed network across both small and large datasets.</description>

      <title>In-sensor 24 classes HAR under 850 Bytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The year 2023 was a key year for tinyML unleashing a new age of intelligent sensors pushing intelligence from the MCU into the source of the data at the sensor level, enabling them to perform sophisticated algorithms and machine learning models in real-time. This study presents an innovative approach to Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Intelligent Sensor Processing Units (ISPUs), demonstrating the feasibility of deploying complex machine learning models directly on ultra-constrained sensor hardware. We developed a 24-class HAR model achieving 85\% accuracy while operating within an 850-byte stack memory limit. The model processes accelerometer and gyroscope data in real time, reducing latency, enhancing data privacy, and consuming only 0.5 mA of power. To address memory constraints, we employed incremental class injection and feature optimization techniques, enabling scalability without compromising performance. This work underscores the transformative potential of on-sensor processing for applications in healthcare, predictive maintenance, and smart environments, while introducing a publicly available, diverse HAR dataset for further research. Future efforts will explore advanced compression techniques and broader IoT integration to push the boundaries of TinyML on constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Learning for DOA Estimation with One-Bit Single-Snapshot Sparse Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenging problem of estimating the directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple off-grid signals using a single snapshot of one-bit quantized measurements. Conventional DOA estimation methods face difficulties in tackling this problem effectively. This paper introduces a domain-knowledge-guided learning framework to achieve high-resolution DOA estimation in such a scenario, thus drastically reducing hardware complexity without compromising performance. We first reformulate DOA estimation as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, unifying on-grid and off-grid scenarios under a Laplacian-type sparsity prior to effectively enforce sparsity for both uniform and sparse linear arrays. For off-grid signals, a first-order approximation grid model is embedded into the one-bit signal model. We then reinterpret one-bit sensing as a binary classification task, employing a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood with a logistic link function to enhance stability and estimation accuracy. To resolve the non-convexity inherent in the MAP formulation, we develop augmented algorithmic frameworks based on majorization-minimization principles. Further, we design model-based inference neural networks by deep unrolling these frameworks, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving the estimation precision. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework across a wide range of input signal-to-noise ratio values and off-grid deviations. By integrating the unified model-based priors with data-driven learning, this work bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility in one-bit single-snapshot DOA estimation, offering a scalable, hardware-efficient solution for next-generation radar and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Estimating Time Delays between Signals under Mixed Noise Influence with Novel Cross- and Bispectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common problem to signal processing are biases introduced by correlated noise. In Time-Delay Estimation (TDE), which quantifies a time lag between two signals, noise mixing introduces a bias towards zero delay in conventional TDE protocols based on the cross- or bispectrum. Here we propose two novel TDE approaches that address these shortcomings: (1) A cross-spectrum based TDE protocol that relies on estimating the periodicity of the phase spectrum rather than its slope, and (2) a bispectrum based TDE analysis, bispectral antisymmetrization, which removes contributions from not just Gaussian but all independent sources. In a simulation study, we compare conventional and novel TDE protocols and resolve differences in performance with respect to noise Gaussianity and auto-correlation structure. As a proof-of-concept, we also perform TDE analysis on a neural stimulation dataset (n=3). We find that antisymmetrization consistently outperforms conventional bispectral TDE methods at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and removes spurious zero-delay estimates in all mixed-noise environments. TDE based on phase periodicity also improves signal sensitivity compared to conventional cross-spectral methods. These observations are stable with respect to the magnitude of the delay and the statistical properties of the noise.</description>

      <title>ECG-Expert-QA: A Benchmark for Evaluating Medical Large Language Models in Heart Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ECG-Expert-QA, a comprehensive multimodal dataset designed for evaluating diagnostic capabilities in ECG interpretation, integrating real clinical data with systematically generated synthetic cases. The dataset encompasses six fundamental diagnostic tasks, comprising 47,211 meticulously curated question-answer pairs that span a spectrum of clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm analysis to complex case interpretation. By simulating challenging clinical cases through a rigorous medical knowledge-guided process, ECG-Expert-QA not only enhances the availability of annotated diagnostic data but also significantly increases the complexity and diversity of clinical presentations, including rare cardiac conditions and temporal progression patterns. This design enables comprehensive evaluation of medical language models across multiple dimensions, including diagnostic accuracy, clinical reasoning, and knowledge integration. To facilitate global research collaboration, ECG-Expert-QA is available in both Chinese and English versions, with rigorous quality control ensuring linguistic and clinical consistency. The dataset's challenging diagnostic tasks, which include interpretation of complex arrhythmias, identification of subtle ischemic changes, and integration of clinical context, establish it as an effective benchmark for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation and pushing the boundaries of current diagnostic models. Our dataset is open-source and available at https://github.com/Zaozzz/ECG-Expert-QA.</description>

      <title>Fusion of ECG Foundation Model Embeddings to Improve Early Detection of Acute Coronary Syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening cardiovascular condition where early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This study explores the use of ECG foundation models, specifically ST-MEM and ECG-FM, to enhance ACS risk assessment using prehospital ECG data collected in ambulances. Both models leverage self-supervised learning (SSL), with ST-MEM using a reconstruction-based approach and ECG-FM employing contrastive learning, capturing unique spatial and temporal ECG features. We evaluate the performance of these models individually and through a fusion approach, where their embeddings are combined for enhanced prediction. Results demonstrate that both foundation models outperform a baseline ResNet-50 model, with the fusion-based approach achieving the highest performance (AUROC: 0.843 +/- 0.006, AUCPR: 0.674 +/- 0.012). These findings highlight the potential of ECG foundation models for early ACS detection and motivate further exploration of advanced fusion strategies to maximize complementary feature utilization.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Aware Masked Autoencoders for Human Activity Recognition using Accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are widely used for continuous monitoring of physical activity. Supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms have long been used to extract meaningful activity information from raw accelerometry data, but progress has been hampered by the limited amount of publicly available labeled data. Exploiting large unlabeled datasets using self-supervised pretraining is a relatively new and underexplored approach in the field of human activity recognition (HAR). We used a time-series transformer masked autoencoder (MAE) approach to self-supervised pretraining and propose a novel spectrogram-based loss function named the log-scale mean magnitude (LMM) loss. We compared MAE models pretrained with LMM to one trained with the mean squared error (MSE) loss. We leveraged the large unlabeled UK Biobank accelerometry dataset (n = 109k) for pretraining and evaluated downstream HAR performance using linear classifier in a smaller labelled dataset. We found that pretraining with the LMM loss improved performance compared to a model pretrained with the MSE loss, with balanced accuracies of 0.848 and 0.709, respectively. Further analysis revealed that better convergence of the LMM loss, but not the MSE loss significantly correlated with improved downstream performance (r=-0.61, p=0.04) for balanced accuracy). Finally, we compared our MAE models to the state-of-the-art for HAR, also pretrained on the UK Biobank accelerometry data. Our LMM-pretrained models performed better when finetuned using a linear classifier and performed comparably when finetuned using an LSTM classifier, while MSE-pretrained models consistently underperformed. Our findings demonstrate that the LMM loss is a robust and effective method for pretraining MAE models on accelerometer data for HAR. Future work should explore optimizing loss function combinations and extending our approach to other tasks.</description>

      <title>Low-Interference Near-Field Multi-User Communication Enabled by Spatially Converging Multi-Mode Vortex Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-user Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM) near-field access scheme, inspired by the orthogonal characteristics of multi-mode vortex waves. A Reconfigurable Meta-surface (RM) is ingeniously employed as the gateway for information transmission. This RM not only receives spatially overlapping multiplexed multi-mode vortex beams but also converts them into focused point beams in the near field. Specifically, a multi-port microstrip array method is utilized to generate multiple orthogonal vortex electromagnetic wave modes. Different ports serve as feeding points for baseband signals, allowing independent modulated data to be flexibly loaded onto different modes. After being adjusted by the RM, the vortex electromagnetic waves are converted into energy-focusing point beams, which can be directed to arbitrary 3D positions in the RM's near-field region and received by different users. Since the spatial positions of the point beams are non-overlapping, this approach not only ensures energy concentration but also significantly reduces inter-user interference. Near-field scanning results in a microwave anechoic chamber validate the effectiveness of this method, while real-time communication demonstrations confirm the system's capability for low-interference information multiplexing and transmission in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Brain-to-Text Decoding: A Non-invasive Approach via Typing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neuroprostheses can now restore communication in patients who have lost the ability to speak or move. However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</description>

      <title>Toward Foundational Model for Sleep Analysis Using a Multimodal Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Contrastive Network (MCNet) for Motor Imagery Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: An electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) serves as a direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external device. While supervised learning has been extensively explored for motor imagery (MI) EEG classification, small data quantity has been a key factor limiting the performance of deep feature learning. Methods: This paper proposes a knowledge-driven time-space-frequency based multi-view contrastive network (MCNet) for MI EEG decoding in BCIs. MCNet integrates knowledge from the time, space, and frequency domains into the training process through data augmentations from multiple views, fostering more discriminative feature learning of the characteristics of EEG data. We introduce a cross-view contrasting module to learn from different augmented views and a cross-model contrasting module to enhance the consistency of features extracted between knowledge-guided and data-driven models. Results: The combination of EEG data augmentation strategies was systematically investigated for more informative supervised contrastive learning. Experiments on four public MI datasets and three different architectures demonstrated that MCNet outperformed 10 existing approaches. Significance: Our approach can significantly boost EEG classification performance beyond designated networks, showcasing the potential to enhance the feature learning process for better EEG decoding.</description>

      <title>ConSense: Continually Sensing Human Activity with WiFi via Growing and Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based human activity recognition (HAR) holds significant application potential across various fields. To handle dynamic environments where new activities are continuously introduced, WiFi-based HAR systems must adapt by learning new concepts without forgetting previously learned ones. Furthermore, retaining knowledge from old activities by storing historical exemplar is impractical for WiFi-based HAR due to privacy concerns and limited storage capacity of edge devices. In this work, we propose ConSense, a lightweight and fast-adapted exemplar-free class incremental learning framework for WiFi-based HAR. The framework leverages the transformer architecture and involves dynamic model expansion and selective retraining to preserve previously learned knowledge while integrating new information. Specifically, during incremental sessions, small-scale trainable parameters that are trained specifically on the data of each task are added in the multi-head self-attention layer. In addition, a selective retraining strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights in multilayer perceptron based on the performance stability of neurons across tasks is used. Rather than training the entire model, the proposed strategies of dynamic model expansion and selective retraining reduce the overall computational load while balancing stability on previous tasks and plasticity on new tasks. Evaluation results on three public WiFi datasets demonstrate that ConSense not only outperforms several competitive approaches but also requires fewer parameters, highlighting its practical utility in class-incremental scenarios for HAR.</description>

      <title>Urinary Tract Infection Detection in Digital Remote Monitoring: Strategies for Managing Participant-Specific Prediction Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant health concern, particularly for people living with dementia (PLWD), as they can lead to severe complications if not detected and treated early. This study builds on previous work that utilised machine learning (ML) to detect UTIs in PLWD by analysing in-home activity and physiological data collected through low-cost, passive sensors. The current research focuses on improving the performance of previous models, particularly by refining the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), to better handle variations in home environments and improve sex fairness in predictions by making use of concepts from multitask learning. This study implemented three primary model designs: feature clustering, loss-dependent clustering, and participant ID embedding which were compared against a baseline MLP model. The results demonstrated that the loss-dependent MLP achieved the most significant improvements, increasing validation precision from 48.92% to 72.60% and sensitivity from 27.44% to 70.52%, while also enhancing model fairness across sexes. These findings suggest that the refined models offer a more reliable and equitable approach to early UTI detection in PLWD, addressing participant-specific data variations and enabling clinicians to detect and screen for UTI risks more effectively, thereby facilitating earlier and more accurate treatment decisions.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Sleep Stage and Sleep Apnea Classification Using Vision Transformer: A Multitask Explainable Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep is an essential component of human physiology, contributing significantly to overall health and quality of life. Accurate sleep staging and disorder detection are crucial for assessing sleep quality. Studies in the literature have proposed PSG-based approaches and machine-learning methods utilizing single-modality signals. However, existing methods often lack multimodal, multilabel frameworks and address sleep stages and disorders classification separately. In this paper, we propose a 1D-Vision Transformer for simultaneous classification of sleep stages and sleep disorders. Our method exploits the sleep disorders' correlation with specific sleep stage patterns and performs a simultaneous identification of a sleep stage and sleep disorder. The model is trained and tested using multimodal-multilabel sensory data (including photoplethysmogram, respiratory flow, and respiratory effort signals). The proposed method shows an overall accuracy (cohen's Kappa) of 78% (0.66) for five-stage sleep classification and 74% (0.58) for sleep apnea classification. Moreover, we analyzed the encoder attention weights to clarify our models' predictions and investigate the influence different features have on the models' outputs. The result shows that identified patterns, such as respiratory troughs and peaks, make a higher contribution to the final classification process.</description>

      <title>Using Graph Convolutional Networks to Address fMRI Small Data Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although great advances in the analysis of neuroimaging data have been made, a major challenge is a lack of training data. This is less problematic in tasks such as diagnosis, where much data exists, but particularly prevalent in harder problems such as predicting treatment responses (prognosis), where data is focused and hence limited. Here, we address the learning from small data problems for medical imaging using graph neural networks. This is particularly challenging as the information about the patients is themselves graphs (regions of interest connectivity graphs). We show how a spectral representation of the connectivity data allows for efficient propagation that can yield approximately 12\% improvement over traditional deep learning methods using the exact same data. We show that our method's superior performance is due to a data smoothing result that can be measured by closing the number of triangle inequalities and thereby satisfying transitivity.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of Wearable ECG Parameter Calculation Method for Long QT and First-Degree A-V Block Detection: A Multi-Center Real-World Study with External Validations Compared to Standard ECG Machines and Cardiologist Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, wearable devices have revolutionized cardiac monitoring by enabling continuous, non-invasive ECG recording in real-world settings. Despite these advances, the accuracy of ECG parameter calculations (PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, etc.) from wearables remains to be rigorously validated against conventional ECG machines and expert clinician assessments. In this large-scale, multicenter study, we evaluated FeatureDB, a novel algorithm for automated computation of ECG parameters from wearable single-lead signals Three diverse datasets were employed: the AHMU-FH dataset (n=88,874), the CSE dataset (n=106), and the HeartVoice-ECG-lite dataset (n=369) with annotations provided by two experienced cardiologists. FeatureDB demonstrates a statistically significant correlation with key parameters (PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTc) calculated by standard ECG machines and annotated by clinical doctors. Bland-Altman analysis confirms a high level of agreement.Moreover,FeatureDB exhibited robust diagnostic performance in detecting Long QT syndrome (LQT) and atrioventricular block interval abnormalities (AVBI),with excellent area under the ROC curve (LQT: 0.836, AVBI: 0.861),accuracy (LQT: 0.856, AVBI: 0.845),sensitivity (LQT: 0.815, AVBI: 0.877),and specificity (LQT: 0.856, AVBI: 0.845).This further validates its clinical reliability. These results validate the clinical applicability of FeatureDB for wearable ECG analysis and highlight its potential to bridge the gap between traditional diagnostic methods and emerging wearable technologies.Ultimately,this study supports integrating wearable ECG devices into large-scale cardiovascular disease management and early intervention strategies,and it highlights the potential of wearable ECG technologies to deliver accurate,clinically relevant cardiac monitoring while advancing broader applications in cardiovascular care.</description>

      <title>Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Power Transfer-assisted IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Bearing Fault Classification Under Variable Conditions: A 1D CNN with Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bearings play an integral role in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of rotating machinery - reducing friction and handling critical loads. Bearing failures that constitute up to 90% of mechanical faults highlight the imperative need for reliable condition monitoring and fault detection. This study proposes a multimodal bearing fault classification approach that relies on vibration and motor phase current signals within a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) framework. The method fuses features from multiple signals to enhance the accuracy of fault detection. Under the baseline condition (1,500 rpm, 0.7 Nm load torque, and 1,000 N radial force), the model reaches an accuracy of 96% with addition of L2 regularization. This represents a notable improvement of 2% compared to the non-regularized model. In addition, the model demonstrates robust performance across three distinct operating conditions by employing transfer learning (TL) strategies. Among the tested TL variants, the approach that preserves parameters up to the first max-pool layer and then adjusts subsequent layers achieves the highest performance. While this approach attains excellent accuracy across varied conditions, it requires more computational time due to its greater number of trainable parameters. To address resource constraints, less computationally intensive models offer feasible trade-offs, albeit at a slight accuracy cost. Overall, this multimodal 1D CNN framework with late fusion and TL strategies lays a foundation for more accurate, adaptable, and efficient bearing fault classification in industrial environments with variable operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Interference Factors and Compensation Methods when Using Infrared Thermography for Temperature Measurement: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared thermography (IRT) is a widely used temperature measurement technology, but it faces the problem of measurement errors under interference factors. This paper attempts to summarize the common interference factors and temperature compensation methods when applying IRT. According to the source of factors affecting the infrared temperature measurement accuracy, the interference factors are divided into three categories: factors from the external environment, factors from the measured object, and factors from the infrared thermal imager itself. At the same time, the existing compensation methods are classified into three categories: Mechanism Modeling based Compensation method (MMC), Data-Driven Compensation method (DDC), and Mechanism and Data jointly driven Compensation method (MDC). Furthermore, we discuss the problems existing in the temperature compensation methods and future research directions, aiming to provide some references for researchers in academia and industry when using IRT technology for temperature measurement.</description>

      <title>Temperature Compensation Method of Six-Axis Force/Torque Sensor Using Gated Recurrent Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to enhance the accuracy of a six-axis force/torque sensor compared to existing approaches that utilize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Least Square Method. The sensor used in this study is based on a photo-coupler and operates with infrared light, making it susceptible to dark current effects, which cause drift due to temperature variations. Additionally, the sensor is compact and lightweight (45g), resulting in a low thermal capacity. Consequently, even small amounts of heat can induce rapid temperature changes, affecting the sensor's performance in real time. To address these challenges, this study compares the conventional MLP approach with the proposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based method. Experimental results demonstrate that the GRU approach, leveraging sequential data, achieves superior performance.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Design of Frequency Selective Surface based Radar Absorbing Material via Image Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an innovative methodology for designing frequency selective surface (FSS) based radar absorbing materials using machine learning (ML) technique. In conventional electromagnetic design, unit cell dimensions of FSS are used as input and absorption coefficient is then predicted for a given design. In this paper, absorption coefficient is considered as input to ML model and image of FSS unit cell is predicted. Later, this image is used for generating the FSS unit cell parameters. Eleven different ML models are studied over a wide frequency band of 1GHz to 30GHz. Out of which six ML models (i.e. (a) Random Forest classification, (b) K- Neighbors Classification, (c) Grid search regression, (d) Random Forest regression, (e) Decision tree classification, and (f) Decision tree regression) show training accuracy more than 90%. The absorption coefficients with varying frequencies of these predicted images are subsequently evaluated using commercial electromagnetic solver. The performance of these ML models is encouraging, and it can be used for accelerating design and optimization of high performance FSS based radar absorbing material for advanced electromagnetic applications in future.</description>

      <title>CLEP-GAN: An Innovative Approach to Subject-Independent ECG Reconstruction from PPG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of reconstructing unseen ECG signals from PPG signals, a critical task for non-invasive cardiac monitoring. While numerous public ECG-PPG datasets are available, they lack the diversity seen in image datasets, and data collection processes often introduce noise, complicating ECG reconstruction from PPG even with advanced machine learning models. To tackle these challenges, we first introduce a novel synthetic ECG-PPG data generation technique using an ODE model to enhance training diversity. Next, we develop a novel subject-independent PPG-to-ECG reconstruction model that integrates contrastive learning, adversarial learning, and attention gating, achieving results comparable to or even surpassing existing approaches for unseen ECG reconstruction. Finally, we examine factors such as sex and age that impact reconstruction accuracy, emphasizing the importance of considering demographic diversity during model training and dataset augmentation.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Division Multiple Access for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel concept of waveguide division multiple access (WDMA) is proposed for multi-user pinching-antenna systems (PASS). The key principle of WDMA is to allocate each user with a dedicated waveguide, which is regarded as a new type of radio resources, so as to facilitate multi-user communications. By adjusting the activation positions of pinching antennas (PAs) over each waveguide, the pinching beamforming can be exploited for intended user signal enhancement and inter-user interference mitigation. Considering both ideal continuous and practical discrete PA position activation schemes, a joint power allocation and pinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated for the maximization of the sum rate. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to address the formulated nonconvex problem. For solving the power allocation subproblem, the successive convex approximation method is invoked. For the pinching beamforming design subproblem, a penalty-based gradient ascent algorithm is first developed for the continuous PA activation case. Then, for the discrete PA activation case, a matching theory-based algorithm is proposed to achieve the near-optimal performance but with a low complexity. Numerical results unveil that: 1) For both continuous and discrete activation cases, PASS can achieve a significant performance gain over conventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) the proposed WDMA can effectively underpin multi-user communications with the near orthogonality in free space achieved by the pinching beamforming; and 3) the performance gap between the discrete and continuous activation cases can be significantly alleviated with practically feasible numbers of PA candidate positions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve ubiquitous connectivity in next-generation networks through aerospace communications while maintaining high data rates, Terahertz (THz) band communications (0.1-10 THz) with large continuous bandwidths are considered a promising candidate technology. However, key enabling techniques and practical implementations of THz communications for aerospace applications remain limited. In this paper, the wireless channel characteristics, enabling communication techniques, and networking strategies for THz aerospace communications are investigated, aiming to assess their feasibility and encourage future research efforts toward system realization. Specifically, the wireless channel characteristics across various altitudes and scenarios are first analyzed, focusing on modeling the interaction between the THz wave and the external environment, from ground to outer space. Next, key enabling communication technologies, including multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique, beam alignment and tracking, integrated communication and radar sensing (ICARS), and resource allocation for networking are discussed. Finally, the existing challenges and possible future directions are summarized and discussed.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Radar Sensing for Terahertz Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from isolated systems to integrated solutions has driven the development of space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) as well as the integration of communication and radar sensing functionalities. By leveraging the unique properties of the Terahertz (THz) band, THz joint communication and radar sensing (JCRS) supports high-speed communication and precise sensing, addressing the growing demands of SAGIN for connectivity and environmental awareness. However, most existing THz studies focus on terrestrial and static scenarios, with limited consideration for the dynamic and non-terrestrial environments of SAGIN. In this paper, the THz JCRS techniques for SAGIN are comprehensively investigated. Specifically, propagation characteristics and channel models of THz waves in non-terrestrial environments are analyzed. A link capacity comparison with millimeter-wave, THz, and free-space optical frequency bands is conducted to highlight the advantages of THz frequencies. Moreover, novel JCRS waveform design strategies are presented to achieve mutual merit of communication and radar sensing, while networking strategies are developed to overcome challenges in SAGIN such as high mobility. Furthermore, advancements in THz device technologies, including antennas and amplifiers, are reviewed to assess their roles in enabling practical JCRS implementations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming with Orthogonal delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing Modulation for Terahertz Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Terahertz band holds a promise to enable both super-accurate sensing and ultra-fast communication. However, challenges arise that severe Doppler effects call for a waveform with high Doppler robustness while severe propagation path loss urges for an ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) structure. To tackle these challenges, hybrid beamforming with orthogonal delay-Doppler multiplexing modulation (ODDM) is investigated in this paper. First, the integration of delay-Doppler waveform and MIMO is explored by deriving a hybrid beamforming-based UM-MIMO ODDM input-output relation. Then, a multi-dimension sensing algorithm on target azimuth angle, elevation angle, range and velocity is proposed, which features low complexity and high accuracy. Finally, a sensing-centric hybrid beamforming is proposed to design the sensing combiner by minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) of angles. After that, the precoder that affects both communication and sensing is then designed to maximize the spectral efficiency. Numerical results show that the sensing accuracy of the proposed sensing algorithm is sufficiently close to CRLB. Moreover, the proposed hybrid beamforming design allows to achieve maximal spectral efficiency, millimeter-level range estimation accuracy, millidegree-level angle estimation accuracy and millimeter-per-second-level velocity estimation accuracy. Take-away lessons are two-fold. Combiner design is critical especially for sensing, which is commonly neglected in hybrid beamforming design for communication. Furthermore, the optimization problems for communication and sensing can be decoupled and solved independently, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the THz monostatic ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Free Resource Scheduling: Towards Flexible Multi-BS Cooperation in FD-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible cooperation among base stations (BSs) is critical to improve resource utilization efficiency and meet personalized user demands. However, its practical implementation is hindered by the current radio access network (RAN), which relies on the coupling of uplink and downlink transmissions and channel state information feedback with inherent issues such as overheads and delays. To overcome these limitations, we consider the fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN), in which uplink and downlink networks are independent, and feedback-free MIMO transmission is adopted at the physical layer. To further deliver flexible cooperation in FD-RAN, we investigate the practical scheduling process and study feedback-free downlink multi-BS resource scheduling. The problem is considered based on network load conditions. In heavy-load states where it is impossible for all user demands to be met, an optimal greedy algorithm is proposed, maximizing the weighted sum of user demand satisfaction rates. In light-load states where at least one solution exists to satisfy all user demands, an optimal two-stage resource allocation algorithm is designed to further minimize network energy consumption by leveraging the flexibility of cooperation. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of proposed algorithms in performance and running time, and highlight the potential for realizing flexible cooperation in practice.</description>

      <title>Beamforming with hybrid reconfigurable parasitic antenna arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parasitic reconfigurable antenna array is a low-power approach for beamforming using passive tunable elements. Prior work on reconfigurable antennas in communication theory is based on ideal radiation pattern abstractions. It does not address the problem of physical realizability. Beamforming with parasitic elements is inherently difficult because mutual coupling creates non-linearity in the beamforming gain objective. We develop a multi-port circuit-theoretic model of the hybrid array with parasitic elements and antennas with active RF chain validated through electromagnetic simulations with a dipole array. We then derive the beamforming weight of the parasitic element using the theoretical beam pattern expression for the case of a single active antenna and multiple parasitic elements. We show that the parasitic beamforming is challenging because the weights are subject to coupled magnitude and phase constraints. We simplify the beamforming optimization problem using a shift-of-origin transformation to the typical unit-modulus beamforming weight. With this transformation, we derive a closed-form solution for the reconfigurable parasitic reactance. We generalize this solution to the multi-active multi-parasitic hybrid array operating in a multi-path channel. Our proposed hybrid architecture with parasitic elements outperforms conventional architectures in terms of energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>5G Direct Position Estimation for Precise Localization in Dense Urban Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) signals have emerged as a promising supplementary resource for urban navigation. However, a major challenge in utilizing 5G signals lies in their vulnerability to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation effects, which are especially prevalent in urban street canyons. This paper applies the direct position estimation (DPE) method to 5G cellular signals to mitigate the NLoS bias as well as the multipath effects, thereby enabling precise localization in urbanized environments. The feasibility of applying the DPE method to NR positioning is analyzed, followed by a discussion of the tapped delay line (TDL) channel propagation model provided by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The positioning performance is then evaluated through large-scale system-level simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that 5G DPE achieves satisfactory positioning accuracy in a 10 dB noisy channel, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) constrained within 6 m. In addition, 5G DPE outperforms the observed time difference of arrival (OTDoA) method by 95.24% in terms of positioning accuracy in an NLoS-dominated propagation environment.</description>

      <title>Optimum Noncoherent Detection of Constant-Envelope Signals using Received Signal Magnitudes -- Energy Detection and Amplitude Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constant-envelope signals are widely employed in wireless communication systems due to their hardware-friendly design, energy efficiency, and enhanced reliability. However, detecting these signals reliably using simple, power-efficient receivers remains a critical challenge. While coherent detection methods generally offer superior performance, they require complex frequency synchronization, which increases receiver complexity and power consumption. In contrast, noncoherent detection is inherently simpler since it avoids frequency synchronization. However, traditional noncoherent detection approaches still rely on In-phase and Quadrature-phase (IQ) demodulators to extract the noisy received signal magnitudes, and assume the energy detector as the test statistic according to the IQ structure, without rigorous theoretical justification. Motivated by the practical need for robust and low-complexity detection, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework for optimal signal detection using a simple bandpass-filter envelope-detector (BFED) in conjunction with a Bayesian approach and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) under unknown amplitude conditions. By leveraging approximations of the modified Bessel functions, we derive two distinct regimes of the optimal detector. In the low SNR regime, we rigorously prove that the energy detector emerges as the Bayesian-optimal solution, thereby establishing its theoretical validity for the first time. In the high SNR regime, we derive a novel amplitude-based detector that directly compares the estimated amplitude against the noise standard deviation, leading to a simple yet optimal detection strategy. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings, confirming that both the energy and amplitude detectors achieve the minimum error probability in their respective SNR domains.</description>

      <title>Upper Mid-Band Spectrum for 6G: Vision, Opportunity and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the pursuit of gigabit-per-second data speeds for future 6G mobile networks, in addition to the support of sensing and artificial intelligence applications, the industry is expanding beyond crowded sub-6 GHz bands with innovative new spectrum allocations. In this paper, we chart a compelling vision for 6G within the frequency range 3 (FR3) spectrum, i.e. $7.125$-$24.25$ $\GHz$, by delving into its key enablers and addressing the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead for these new frequency bands. Here we highlight the physical properties of this \textcolor{black}{never-before} used spectrum by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity (e.g. data rate) tradeoffs, while also examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output, compact and digital architectures, and evaluate the potential of multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new optimization framework dedicated for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) waveform design. In particular, the problem aims at maximizing the total achievable sum-rate, through multi-user interference minimization, while preserving a certain level of similarity to a given desired radar waveform. Aiming towards feasible and practical PHY architectures, we also offer the flexibility of tuning the peak-to-average power ratio to a desired level. Towards this design, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated, and an alternating direction method of multipliers based solution is derived to converge towards the superiority of the final ISAC waveform. Finally, simulation results validate the proposed ISAC waveform design, as compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Cell Coordinated Beamforming for Integrate Communication and Multi-TMT Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates integrated localization and communication in a multi-cell system and proposes a coordinated beamforming algorithm to enhance target localization accuracy while preserving communication performance. Within this integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is adopted to quantify the accuracy of target localization, with its closed-form expression derived for the first time. It is shown that the nuisance parameters can be disregarded without impacting the CRLB of time of arrival (TOA)-based target localization. Capitalizing on the derived CRLB, we formulate a nonconvex coordinated beamforming problem to minimize the CRLB while satisfying signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints in communication. To facilitate the development of solution, we reformulate the original problem into a more tractable form and solve it through semi-definite programming (SDP). Notably, we show that the proposed algorithm can always obtain rank-one global optimal solutions under mild conditions. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over benchmark algorithms and reveal the performance trade-off between localization accuracy and communication SINR.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-enabled Wireless Communications for Robust Low-Altitude Economy Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) have emerged as significant enablers of social activities, offering low-altitude services such as the transportation of packages, groceries, and medical supplies. Unlike traditional terrestrial networks, LAENets are characterized by control mechanisms and ever-changing operational factors, which make them more complex and susceptible to vulnerabilities. As applications of LAENet continue to expand, robustness of these systems becomes crucial. In this paper, we investigate a novel application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to improve the robustness of LAENets. We conduct a systematic analysis of robustness requirements for LAENets, complemented by a comprehensive review of robust Quality of Service (QoS) metrics from the wireless physical layer perspective. We then investigate existing GenAI-enabled approaches for robustness enhancement. This leads to our proposal of a novel diffusion-based optimization framework with a Mixture of Expert (MoE)-transformer actor network. In the robust beamforming case study, the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by optimizing beamforming under uncertainties, achieving a more than 44% increase in the worst-case achievable secrecy rate. These findings highlight the significant potential of GenAI in strengthening LAENet robustness.</description>

      <title>Edge Training and Inference with Analog ReRAM Technology for Hand Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile hand gesture recognition is a crucial task for user control in the automotive sector, where Human-Machine Interactions (HMI) demand low latency and high energy efficiency. This study addresses the challenges of power-constrained edge training and inference by utilizing analog Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) technology in conjunction with a real tactile hand gesture dataset. By optimizing the input space through a feature engineering strategy, we avoid relying on large-scale crossbar arrays, making the system more suitable for edge deployment. Through realistic hardware-aware simulations that account for device non-idealities derived from experimental data, we demonstrate the functionalities of our analog ReRAM-based analog in-memory computing for on-chip training, utilizing the state-of-the-art Tiki-Taka algorithm. Furthermore, we validate the classification accuracy of approximately 91.4% for post-deployment inference of hand gestures. The results highlight the potential of analog ReRAM technology and crossbar architecture with fully parallelized matrix computations for real-time HMI systems at the Edge.</description>

      <title>Task-Agnostic Semantic Communication with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing semantic communication (SemCom) systems use deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) to encode task-specific semantics in a goal-oriented manner. However, their reliance on predefined tasks and datasets significantly limits their flexibility and generalizability in practical deployments. Multi-modal foundation models provide a promising solution by generating universal semantic tokens. Inspired by this, we introduce SemCLIP, a task-agnostic SemCom framework leveraging the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model. By transmitting CLIP-generated image tokens instead of raw images, SemCLIP enables efficient semantic communications under low bandwidth and challenging channel conditions, facilitating diverse downstream tasks and zero-shot applications. Specifically, we propose a DeepJSCC scheme for efficient CLIP tokens encoding. To mitigate potential degradation caused by compression and channel noise, a multi-modal transmission-aware prompt learning mechanism is designed at the receiver, which adapts prompts based on transmission quality, enhancing system robustness and channel adaptability. Simulation results demonstrate that SemCLIP outperforms the baselines, achieving a $41\%$ improvement in zero-shot accuracy at a low signal-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, SemCLIP reduces bandwidth usage by more than $50$-fold compared to different image transmission methods, demonstrating the potential of foundation models towards a generalized, task-agnostic SemCom solution.</description>

      <title>Integrated Localization and Communication with Sparse MIMO: Will Virtual Array Technology also Benefit Wireless Communication?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the 6G wireless networks, achieving high-performance integrated localization and communication (ILAC) is critical to unlock the full potential of wireless networks. To simultaneously enhance localization and communication performance cost-effectively, this paper proposes sparse multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) based ILAC with nested and co-prime sparse arrays deployed at the base station. Sparse MIMO relaxes the traditional half-wavelength antenna spacing constraint to enlarge the antenna aperture, thus enhancing localization degrees of freedom and providing finer spatial resolution. However, it also leads to undesired grating lobes, which may cause severe inter-user interference for communication and angular ambiguity for localization. While the latter issue can be effectively addressed by the virtual array technology, by forming sum or difference co-arrays via signal (conjugate) correlation among array elements, it is unclear whether the similar virtual array technology also benefits wireless communications for ILAC systems. In this paper, we first reveal that the answer to the above question is negative, by showing that forming virtual arrays for wireless communication will cause destruction of phase information, degradation of signal-to-noise ratio and aggravation of multi-user interference. Therefore, we propose the hybrid processing for sparse MIMO based ILAC, i.e., physical array based communication while virtual array based localization. To this end, we characterize the beam pattern of sparse arrays by three metrics, demonstrating that despite of the introduction of grating lobes, sparse arrays can also bring benefits to communications thanks to its narrower main lobe beam width than the conventional compact arrays. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance gains of sparse MIMO based ILAC over that based on the conventional compact MIMO.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Unfolding Approach to RIS Phase Shift Optimization Via Transformer-Based Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising solution that can provide dynamic control over the propagation of electromagnetic waves. The RIS technology is envisioned as a key enabler of sixth-generation networks by offering the ability to adaptively manipulate signal propagation through the smart configuration of its phase shift coefficients, thereby optimizing signal strength, coverage, and capacity. However, the realization of this technology's full potential hinges on the accurate acquisition of channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we propose an efficient CSI prediction framework for a RIS-assisted communication system based on the machine learning (ML) transformer architecture. Architectural modifications are introduced to the vanilla transformer for multivariate time series forecasting to achieve high prediction accuracy. The predicted channel coefficients are then used to optimize the RIS phase shifts. Simulation results present a comprehensive analysis of key performance metrics, including data rate and outage probability. Our results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ML approach and demonstrate its superiority over other baseline ML-based CSI prediction schemes such as conventional deep neural networks and long short-term memory architectures, albeit at the cost of slightly increased complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel indoor positioning approach that leverages antenna radiation pattern characteristics through Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) measurements in a single-antenna system. By rotating the antenna or reconfiguring its radiation pattern, we derive a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm that achieves near-optimal positioning accuracy approaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Through theoretical analysis, we establish three fundamental theorems characterizing the estimation accuracy bounds and demonstrating how performance improves with increased signal-to-noise ratio, antenna rotation count, and radiation pattern variations. Additionally, we propose a two-position measurement strategy that eliminates dependence on receiving antenna patterns. Simulation results validate that our approach provides an effective solution for indoor robot tracking applications where both accuracy and system simplicity are essential considerations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the inherent connection between sensing systems and wireless communications can improve their overall performance and is the core objective of joint communications and sensing. For effective communications, one has to frequently estimate the channel. Sensing, on the other hand, infers properties of the environment mostly based on estimated physical channel parameters, such as directions of arrival or delays. This work presents a low-complexity generative modeling approach that simultaneously estimates the wireless channel and its physical parameters without additional computational overhead. To this end, we leverage a recently proposed physics-informed generative model for wireless channels based on sparse Bayesian generative modeling and exploit the feature of conditionally Gaussian generative models to approximate the conditional mean estimator.</description>

      <title>On Neural Inertial Classification Networks for Pedestrian Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial sensors are crucial for recognizing pedestrian activity. Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved inertial sensing performance and robustness. Different domains and platforms use deep-learning techniques to enhance network performance, but there is no common benchmark. The latter is crucial for fair comparison and evaluation within a standardized framework. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by defining and analyzing ten data-driven techniques for improving neural inertial classification networks. In order to accomplish this, we focused on three aspects of neural networks: network architecture, data augmentation, and data preprocessing. The experiments were conducted across four datasets collected from 78 participants. In total, over 936 minutes of inertial data sampled between 50-200Hz were analyzed. Data augmentation through rotation and multi-head architecture consistently yields the most significant improvements. Additionally, this study outlines benchmarking strategies for enhancing neural inertial classification networks.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Noise-Masking with Music through Deep Spectral Envelope Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People often listen to music in noisy environments, seeking to isolate themselves from ambient sounds. Indeed, a music signal can mask some of the noise's frequency components due to the effect of simultaneous masking. In this article, we propose a neural network based on a psychoacoustic masking model, designed to enhance the music's ability to mask ambient noise by reshaping its spectral envelope with predicted filter frequency responses. The model is trained with a perceptual loss function that balances two constraints: effectively masking the noise while preserving the original music mix and the user's chosen listening level. We evaluate our approach on simulated data replicating a user's experience of listening to music with headphones in a noisy environment. The results, based on defined objective metrics, demonstrate that our system improves the state of the art.</description>

      <title>EEGM2: An Efficient Mamba-2-Based Self-Supervised Framework for Long-Sequence EEG Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant progress in the development of electroencephalogram (EEG) foundation models, with Transformer-based architectures excelling at capturing long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic computational complexity presents challenges in memory efficiency, training, and inference speed, limiting their scalability and generalizability as a foundation model. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework based on structured state space duality (SSD) that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 introduces three key innovations: (1) a reconstruction-based framework that captures both local and global EEG features through Mamba-2 structured state space models, (2) a spatiotemporal-aware loss function that enhances robustness to noise and preserves spectral information, and (3) a multi-branch receptive field input embedding strategy that improves cross-subject generalization and stability for EEG sequences of varying lengths. In comparison to traditional pretraining methods, on raw EEG or latent representation spaces, EEGM2 shows superior performance on long-sequence tasks, where conventional models struggle. Our experimental results on six EEG datasets validate that EEGM2 not only achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy but also reduces computational overhead, making it a more efficient solution for deployment on resource-constrained BCI devices.</description>

      <title>Arrhythmia Classification from 12-Lead ECG Signals Using Convolutional and Transformer-Based Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Romania, cardiovascular problems are the leading cause of death, accounting for nearly one-third of annual fatalities. The severity of this situation calls for innovative diagnosis method for cardiovascular diseases. This article aims to explore efficient, light-weight and rapid methods for arrhythmia diagnosis, in resource-constrained healthcare settings. Due to the lack of Romanian public medical data, we trained our systems using international public datasets, having in mind that the ECG signals are the same regardless the patients' nationality. Within this purpose, we combined multiple datasets, usually used in the field of arrhythmias classification: PTB-XL electrocardiography dataset , PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, China 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database, Georgia 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database, and St. Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database. For the input data, we employed ECG signal processing methods, specifically a variant of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, useful in arrhythmia classification because it provides a robust and efficient method for detecting QRS complexes in ECG signals. Additionally, we used machine learning techniques, widely used for the task of classification, including convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs, 2D CNNs, ResNet) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The systems were evaluated in terms of accuracy and F1 score. We annalysed our dataset from two perspectives. First, we fed the systems with the ECG signals and the GRU-based 1D CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 93.4% among all the tested architectures. Secondly, we transformed ECG signals into images and the CNN2D model achieved an accuracy of 92.16%.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Movable Antennas for Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has been recognized as a promising technology to enhance the performance of wireless communication and sensing by enabling antenna movement. Such a significant paradigm shift from conventional fixed antennas (FAs) to MAs offers tremendous new opportunities towards realizing more versatile, adaptive and efficient next-generation wireless networks such as 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on the fundamentals and advancements in the area of MA-empowered wireless networks. First, we overview the historical development and contemporary applications of MA technologies. Next, to characterize the continuous variation in wireless channels with respect to antenna position and/or orientation, we present new field-response channel models tailored for MAs, which are applicable to narrowband and wideband systems as well as far-field and near-field propagation conditions. Subsequently, we review the state-of-the-art architectures for implementing MAs and discuss their practical constraints. A general optimization framework is then formulated to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in antenna movement for performance enhancement in wireless systems. In particular, we delve into two major design issues for MA systems. First, we address the intricate antenna movement optimization problem for various communication and/or sensing systems to maximize the performance gains achievable by MAs. Second, we deal with the challenging channel acquisition issue in MA systems for reconstructing the channel mapping between arbitrary antenna positions inside the transmitter and receiver regions. Moreover, we show existing prototypes developed for MA-aided communication/sensing and the experimental results based on them. Finally, the extension of MA design to other wireless systems and its synergy with other emerging wireless technologies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing-Based Sum Rate Maximization for Multi-UAV-Aided Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wireless communication networks, it is difficult to solve many NP-hard problems owing to computational complexity and high cost. Recently, quantum annealing (QA) based on quantum physics was introduced as a key enabler for solving optimization problems quickly. However, only some studies consider quantum-based approaches in wireless communications. Therefore, we investigate the performance of a QA solution to an optimization problem in wireless networks. Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum rate by jointly optimizing clustering, sub-channel assignment, and power allocation in a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle-aided wireless network. We formulate the sum rate maximization problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. Then, we divide it into two sub-problems: 1) a QA-based clustering and 2) sub-channel assignment and power allocation for a given clustering configuration. Subsequently, we obtain an optimized solution for the joint optimization problem by solving these two sub-problems. For the first sub-problem, we convert the problem into a simplified quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. As for the second sub-problem, we introduce a novel QA algorithm with optimal scaling parameters to address it. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of the sum rate and running time.</description>

      <title>Remote Training in Task-Oriented Communication: Supervised or Self-Supervised with Fine-Tuning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented communication focuses on extracting and transmitting only the information relevant to specific tasks, effectively minimizing communication overhead. Most existing methods prioritize reducing this overhead during inference, often assuming feasible local training or minimal training communication resources. However, in real-world wireless systems with dynamic connection topologies, training models locally for each new connection is impractical, and task-specific information is often unavailable before establishing connections. Therefore, minimizing training overhead and enabling label-free, task-agnostic pre-training before the connection establishment are essential for effective task-oriented communication. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by employing a mutual information maximization approach grounded in self-supervised learning and information-theoretic analysis. We propose an efficient strategy that pre-trains the transmitter in a task-agnostic and label-free manner, followed by joint fine-tuning of both the transmitter and receiver in a task-specific, label-aware manner. Simulation results show that our proposed method reduces training communication overhead to about half that of full-supervised methods using the SGD optimizer, demonstrating significant improvements in training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quadrotor Neural Dead Reckoning in Periodic Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real world scenarios, due to environmental or hardware constraints, the quadrotor is forced to navigate in pure inertial navigation mode while operating indoors or outdoors. To mitigate inertial drift, end-to-end neural network approaches combined with quadrotor periodic trajectories were suggested. There, the quadrotor distance is regressed and combined with inertial model-based heading estimation, the quadrotor position vector is estimated. To further enhance positioning performance, in this paper we propose a quadrotor neural dead reckoning approach for quadrotors flying on periodic trajectories. In this case, the inertial readings are fed into a simple and efficient network to directly estimate the quadrotor position vector. Our approach was evaluated on two different quadrotors, one operating indoors while the other outdoors. Our approach improves the positioning accuracy of other deep-learning approaches, achieving an average 27% reduction in error outdoors and an average 79% reduction indoors, while requiring only software modifications. With the improved positioning accuracy achieved by our method, the quadrotor can seamlessly perform its tasks.</description>

      <title>HEROS-GAN: Honed-Energy Regularized and Optimal Supervised GAN for Enhancing Accuracy and Range of Low-Cost Accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-cost accelerometers play a crucial role in modern society due to their advantages of small size, ease of integration, wearability, and mass production, making them widely applicable in automotive systems, aerospace, and wearable technology. However, this widely used sensor suffers from severe accuracy and range limitations. To this end, we propose a honed-energy regularized and optimal supervised GAN (HEROS-GAN), which transforms low-cost sensor signals into high-cost equivalents, thereby overcoming the precision and range limitations of low-cost accelerometers. Due to the lack of frame-level paired low-cost and high-cost signals for training, we propose an Optimal Transport Supervision (OTS), which leverages optimal transport theory to explore potential consistency between unpaired data, thereby maximizing supervisory information. Moreover, we propose a Modulated Laplace Energy (MLE), which injects appropriate energy into the generator to encourage it to break range limitations, enhance local changes, and enrich signal details. Given the absence of a dedicated dataset, we specifically establish a Low-cost Accelerometer Signal Enhancement Dataset (LASED) containing tens of thousands of samples, which is the first dataset serving to improve the accuracy and range of accelerometers and is released in Github. Experimental results demonstrate that a GAN combined with either OTS or MLE alone can surpass the previous signal enhancement SOTA methods by an order of magnitude. Integrating both OTS and MLE, the HEROS-GAN achieves remarkable results, which doubles the accelerometer range while reducing signal noise by two orders of magnitude, establishing a benchmark in the accelerometer signal processing.</description>

Abstract: Precise channel state knowledge is crucial in future wireless communication systems, which drives the need for accurate channel prediction without additional pilot overhead. While machine-learning (ML) methods for channel prediction show potential, existing approaches have limitations in their capability to adapt to environmental changes due to their extensive training requirements. In this paper, we introduce the channel prediction approaches in terms of the temporal channel prediction and the environmental adaptation. Then, we elaborate on the use of the advanced ML-based channel prediction to resolve the issues in traditional ML methods. The numerical results show that the advanced ML-based channel prediction has comparable accuracy with much less training overhead compared to conventional prediction methods. Also, we examine the training process, dataset characteristics, and the impact of source tasks and pre-trained models on channel prediction approaches. Finally, we discuss open challenges and possible future research directions of ML-based channel prediction.</description>

      <title>Software implemented fault diagnosis of natural gas pumping unit based on feedforward neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for diagnostics of gas pumping units (GPU). Usually, ANN training is carried out on models of GPU workflows, and generated sets of diagnostic data are used to simulate defect conditions. At the same time, the results obtained do not allow assessing the real state of the GPU. It is proposed to use the values of the characteristics of the acoustic and vibration processes of the GPU as the input data of the ANN. A descriptive statistical analysis of real vibration and acoustic processes generated by the operation of the GPU type GTK-25-i (Nuovo Pignone, Italy) has been carried out. The formation of packets of diagnostic signs arriving at the input of the ANN has been carried out. The diagnostic features are the five maximum amplitude components of the acoustic and vibration signals, as well as the value of the standard deviation for each sample. Diagnostic signs are calculated directly in the input pipeline of ANN data in real time for three technical states of the GPU. Using the frameworks TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, pandas, in the Python 3 programming language, an architecture was developed for a deep fully connected feedforward ANN, training on the error backpropagation algorithm. The results of training and testing of the developed ANN are presented. During testing, it was found that the signal classification precision for the "nominal" state of all 1475 signal samples is 1.0000, for the "current" state, precision equils 0.9853, and for the "defective" state, precision is 0.9091. The use of the developed ANN makes it possible to classify the technical states of the GPU with an accuracy sufficient for practical use, which will prevent the occurrence of GPU failures. ANN can be used to diagnose GPU of any type and power.</description>

      <title>Semantic and Goal-oriented Wireless Network Coverage: The Area of Effectiveness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing wireless coverage is a fundamental task for public network operators and private deployments, whose goal is to guarantee quality of service across the network while minimizing material waste and energy consumption. These maps are usually built through ray tracing techniques and/or channel measurements that can be consequently translated into network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as capacity or throughput. However, next generation networks (e.g., 6G) typically involve beyond communication resources, towards services that require data transmission, but also processing (local and remote) to perform complex decision making in real time, with the best balance between performance, energy consumption, material waste, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of areas of effectiveness, which goes beyond the legacy notion of coverage, towards one that takes into account capability of the network of offering edge Artificial Intelligence (AI)-related computation. We will show that radio coverage is a poor indicator of real system performance, depending on the application and the computing capabilities of network and devices. This opens new challenges in network planning, but also resource orchestration during operation to achieve the specific goal of communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02896v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) algorithm that exploits the structure of a hierarchical codebook of beamforming vectors using a best-arm identification Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach for initial alignment and tracking of a Mobile Entity (ME). The algorithm, called Dynamic Beam Zooming (DBZ), performs beam adjustments that mitigate the severe outages associated with wireless mmWave systems and allow for adaptive control of the parameters governing communications. We analyze the sample complexity of DBZ and use it to inform how the algorithm adapts to the nonstationary MAB statistics based on ME motion and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). We perform extensive simulations to validate the approach and demonstrate that DBZ is competitive against existing Bayesian algorithms, without requiring channel multipath or fading knowledge. In particular, DBZ outperforms other low-complexity algorithms in the low SNR regime. We also illustrate the efficacy of DBZ in standardized rural and urban scenarios using NYU Sim.</description>

      <title>A New Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Approach for Blind Source Separation of Cardiovascular and Respiratory Sound Based on the Periodicity of Heart and Lung Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auscultation provides a rich diversity of information to diagnose cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, sound auscultation is challenging due to noise. In this study, a modified version of the affine non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach is proposed to blindly separate lung and heart sounds recorded by a digital stethoscope. This method applies a novel NMF algorithm, which embodies a parallel structure of multilayer units on the input signal, to find a proper estimation of source signals. Another key innovation is the use of the periodic property of the signals which improves accuracy compared to previous works. The method is tested on 100 cases. Each case consists of two synthesized mixtures of real measurements. The effect of different parameters is discussed, and the results are compared to other current methods. Results demonstrate improvements in the source-to-distortion ratio (SDR), source-to-interference ratio (SIR), and source-to-artifacts ratio (SAR) of heart and lung sounds, respectively.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Based Pilot Design for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following paper presents a novel orthogonal pilot design dedicated for \textcolor{black}{integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)} systems performing multi-user communications and target detection. After careful characterization of both sensing and communication metrics based on mutual information (MI), we propose a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) tailored for pilot design, dedicated for simultaneously maximizing both sensing and communication MIs. Moreover, the MOOP is further simplified to a single-objective optimization problem, which characterizes trade-offs between sensing and communication performances. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we propose to solve it via the projected gradient descent method on the Stiefel manifold. Closed-form gradient expressions are derived, which enable execution of the projected gradient descent algorithm. Furthermore, we prove convergence to a fixed orthogonal pilot matrix. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities and superiority of the proposed pilot design, and corroborate relevant trade-offs between sensing MI and communication MI. In particular, significant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains for communication are reported, while re-using the same pilots for target detection with significant gains in terms of probability of detection for fixed false-alarm probability. Other interesting findings are reported through simulations, such as an \textit{information overlap} phenomenon, whereby the fruitful ISAC integration can be fully exploited.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Feature Ranking for Impact Fall Detection Event Using Multisensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Falls among individuals, especially the elderly population, can lead to serious injuries and complications. Detecting impact moments within a fall event is crucial for providing timely assistance and minimizing the negative consequences. In this work, we aim to address this challenge by applying thorough preprocessing techniques to the multisensor dataset, the goal is to eliminate noise and improve data quality. Furthermore, we employ a feature selection process to identify the most relevant features derived from the multisensor UP-FALL dataset, which in turn will enhance the performance and efficiency of machine learning models. We then evaluate the efficiency of various machine learning models in detecting the impact moment using the resulting data information from multiple sensors. Through extensive experimentation, we assess the accuracy of our approach using various evaluation metrics. Our results achieve high accuracy rates in impact detection, showcasing the power of leveraging multisensor data for fall detection tasks. This highlights the potential of our approach to enhance fall detection systems and improve the overall safety and well-being of individuals at risk of falls.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy UAV Cooperative Localization: Information Analysis of Performance and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a trustworthy framework for achieving accurate cooperative localization in multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. The Cramer-Rao low bound (CRLB) for the three-dimensional (3D) cooperative localization network is derived, with particular attention given to practical scenarios involving non-uniform spatial distribution of anchor nodes. Challenges of mobility are then addressed with Mobility Adaptive Gradient Descent (MAGD).
  In the context of system security, we derive the CRLB of localization under the influence of falsified information. The methods and strategies of injecting such information and their impact on system performance are studied. To assure robust performance under falsified data, we propose a mitigation solution named Time-evolving Anomaly Detection (TAD). Furthermore, we model the system performance regarding the density and magnitude of falsified information, focusing on realistic scenarios where the adversary is resource-constrained. With the vulnerability of cooperative localization understood, we apply TAD and formulate an optimization problem from the adversary's perspective. Next, we discuss the design principles of an anomaly detector, with emphasis of the trade-off of reducing such optimum and system performance. Additionally, we also deploy a reputation propagation (RP) mechanism to fully utilize the anomaly detection and further optimize the TAD. Our proposed approaches are demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>TiRE-GAN: Task-Incentivized Generative Learning for Radiomap Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To characterize radio frequency (RF) signal power distribution in wireless communication systems, the radiomap is a useful tool for resource allocation and network management. Usually, a dense radiomap is reconstructed from sparse observations collected by deployed sensors or mobile devices. To leverage both physical principles of radio propagation models and data statistics from sparse observations, this work introduces a novel task-incentivized generative learning model, namely TiRE-GAN, for radiomap estimation. Specifically, we first introduce a radio depth map to capture the overall pattern of radio propagation and shadowing effects, following which a task-driven incentive network is proposed to provide feedback for radiomap compensation depending on downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the power of the radio depth map to capture radio propagation information, and the efficiency of the proposed TiRE-GAN for radiomap estimation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Joint Radar and Communication User Association in Cell-Free mMIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems are crucial for 6G development due to their high spectral efficiency and uniform user-experienced data rates. A key aspect of CF-mMIMO is user association (UA) and optimal cluster formation. Traditional methods focusing solely on communication-related metrics fall short in this context, as sensing is becoming integral to 6G. This study delves into a framework for joint radar and communication (JRC) in CF-mMIMO systems and investigates JRC-based UA techniques. We propose a novel method to optimize UA, enhancing both communication spectral efficiency and sensing accuracy. Existing literature has not explored this dual requirement integration for UA. Our proposed two-step scheme optimizes UA clusters for both communication and sensing. The first step involves selecting access points (APs) based on channel quality, followed by a second step that further refines the selection by choosing APs from the initial group that are also optimal for sensing. We utilize the signal-clutter plus noise ratio to exclude APs with clutter in front of the user equipment (UE) and the AP view angle, ensuring that radar echoes are received only from the specific UE, not the surrounding clutter. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the same APs optimized for communication are not necessarily optimal for sensing, highlighting the need for schemes that incorporate sensing requirements in UA. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing its potential to improve CF-mMIMO system performance in JRC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Squint-Aware Synesthesia of Machine (SoM)-Driven Analog Precoder Optimization for Enhanced ISAC Performance in Sub-THz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential benefits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are anticipated to play a significant role in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) mobile information networks. However, the beam squint effect is pronounced in sub-THz systems, expanding coverage areas while severely degrading the communication performance. Existing analog precoder designs struggle to balance both functionalities in the presence of beam squint, limiting the performance gain achievable through ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose two squint-aware analog precoding schemes for sub-THz systems that proactively regulate the correlation between communication and sensing channels, leveraging the inherent degrees of freedom in the hardware architecture to enhance ISAC performance. We first introduce a squint-aware optimization-based analog precoder design approach (SA-Opt). Inspired by the synesthesia of machine (SoM), we further develop an unsupervised learning-assisted complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net) to reduce complexity based on both communication and sensing channel data, tailoring its architecture to the specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transmission of Radiomaps via Physics-Enhanced Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enriching information of spectrum coverage, radiomap plays an important role in many wireless communication applications, such as resource allocation and network optimization. To enable real-time, distributed spectrum management, particularly in the scenarios with unstable and dynamic environments, the efficient transmission of spectrum coverage information for radiomaps from edge devices to the central server emerges as a critical problem. In this work, we propose an innovative physics-enhanced semantic communication framework tailored for efficient radiomap transmission based on generative learning models. Specifically, instead of bit-wise message passing, we only transmit the key "semantics" in radiomaps characterized by the radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments, where semantic compression schemes are utilized to reduce the communication overhead. Incorporating the novel concepts of Radio Depth Maps, the radiomaps are reconstructed from the delivered semantic information backboned on the conditional generative adversarial networks. Our framework is further extended to facilitate its implementation in the scenarios of multi-user edge computing, by integrating with federated learning for collaborative model training while preserving the data privacy. Experimental results show that our approach achieves high accuracy in radio coverage information recovery at ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, which has great potentials in many wireless-generated data transmission applications.</description>

      <title>The Adaptive $\tau$-Lasso: Robustness and Oracle Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09310v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new regularized version of the robust $\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to gross contamination in the response variables and covariates. The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness by establishing the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on robustness properties through simulations. In the face of outliers and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators achieve the best performance or match the best performances of competing regularized estimators, with minimal or no loss in terms of prediction and variable selection accuracy for almost all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators provide attractive tools for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and high-leverage points.</description>

      <title>WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer. The related code, demos, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer.</description>
