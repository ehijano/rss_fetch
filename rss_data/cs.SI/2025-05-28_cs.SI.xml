      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems.</description>

      <title>A Dashboard Approach to Monitoring Mpox-Related Discourse and Misinformation on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mpox (formerly monkeypox) is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus closely related to variola and remains a significant global public health concern. During outbreaks, social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) can both inform and misinform the public, complicating efforts to convey accurate health information. To support local response efforts, we developed a researcher-focused dashboard for use by public health stakeholders and the public that enables searching and visualizing mpox-related tweets through an interactive interface. Following the CDC's designation of mpox as an emerging virus in August 2024, our dashboard recorded a marked increase in tweet volume compared to 2023, illustrating the rapid spread of health discourse across digital platforms. These findings underscore the continued need for real-time social media monitoring tools to support public health communication and track evolving sentiment and misinformation trends at the local level.</description>

      <title>Two-step dimensionality reduction of human mobility data: From potential landscapes to spatiotemporal insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility is crucial for addressing societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Despite advancements in data collection, the complexity and scale of mobility data continue to pose significant analytical challenges. Existing methods often result in losing location-specific details and fail to fully capture the intricacies of human movement. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework to overcome existing limitations. First, we construct a potential landscape of human flow from origin-destination (OD) matrices using combinatorial Hodge theory, preserving essential spatial and structural information while enabling an intuitive visualization of flow patterns. Second, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the potential landscape, systematically identifying major spatiotemporal patterns. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal significant shifts during a pandemic, characterized by an overall declines in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and provide valuable insights into urban planning and public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Identifying Super Spreaders in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.</description>

      <title>DeSocial: Blockchain-based Decentralized Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web 2.0 social platforms are inherently centralized, with user data and algorithmic decisions controlled by the platform. However, users can only passively receive social predictions without being able to choose the underlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the emergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are tailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a personalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own model to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on social interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development chain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and user-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user leverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local subgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction results, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for personalized social prediction. Then, DeSocial uniformly selects several validation nodes that possess the algorithm specified by each user, and aggregates the prediction results by majority voting, to prevent errors caused by any single model's misjudgment. Extensive experiments show that DeSocial has an evident improvement compared to the five classical centralized social network learning models, promoting user empowerment in blockchain-based decentralized social networks, showing the importance of multi-node validation and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/agiresearch/DeSocial.</description>

      <title>Larger cities, more commuters, more crime? The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their role in wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this inter-connectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. Here, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population--crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher crime levels. Specifically, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population constant. We show that models incorporating both population and commuter inflows better explain crime variation than population-only models. These findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population--crime relationship.</description>

      <title>Fedivertex: a Graph Dataset based on Decentralized Social Networks for Trustworthy Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized machine learning - where each client keeps its own data locally and uses its own computational resources to collaboratively train a model by exchanging peer-to-peer messages - is increasingly popular, as it enables better scalability and control over the data. A major challenge in this setting is that learning dynamics depend on the topology of the communication graph, which motivates the use of real graph datasets for benchmarking decentralized algorithms. Unfortunately, existing graph datasets are largely limited to for-profit social networks crawled at a fixed point in time and often collected at the user scale, where links are heavily influenced by the platform and its recommendation algorithms. The Fediverse, which includes several free and open-source decentralized social media platforms such as Mastodon, Misskey, and Lemmy, offers an interesting real-world alternative. We introduce Fedivertex, a new dataset of 182 graphs, covering seven social networks from the Fediverse, crawled weekly over 14 weeks. We release the dataset along with a Python package to facilitate its use, and illustrate its utility on several tasks, including a new defederation task, which captures a process of link deletion observed on these networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Identity and Position Graph Embedding via Spectral-Based Random Feature Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs), which capture graph structures via a feature aggregation mechanism following the graph embedding framework, have demonstrated a powerful ability to support various tasks. According to the topology properties (e.g., structural roles or community memberships of nodes) to be preserved, graph embedding can be categorized into identity and position embedding. However, it is unclear for most GNN-based methods which property they can capture. Some of them may also suffer from low efficiency and scalability caused by several time- and space-consuming procedures (e.g., feature extraction and training). From a perspective of graph signal processing, we find that high- and low-frequency information in the graph spectral domain may characterize node identities and positions, respectively. Based on this investigation, we propose random feature aggregation (RFA) for efficient identity and position embedding, serving as an extreme ablation study regarding GNN feature aggregation. RFA (i) adopts a spectral-based GNN without learnable parameters as its backbone, (ii) only uses random noises as inputs, and (iii) derives embeddings via just one feed-forward propagation (FFP). Inspired by degree-corrected spectral clustering, we further introduce a degree correction mechanism to the GNN backbone. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that two variants of RFA with high- and low-pass filters can respectively derive informative identity and position embeddings via just one FFP (i.e., without any training). As a result, RFA can achieve a better trade-off between quality and efficiency for both identity and position embedding over various baselines.</description>

      <title>Leveraging GANs for citation intent classification and its impact on citation network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citations play a fundamental role in the scientific ecosystem, serving as a foundation for tracking the flow of knowledge, acknowledging prior work, and assessing scholarly influence. In scientometrics, they are also central to the construction of quantitative indicators. Not all citations, however, serve the same function: some provide background, others introduce methods, or compare results. Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced interpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based method to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed method achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching state-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging GAN architectures combined with contextual embeddings in intent classification task. We also investigated whether filtering citation intents affects the centrality of papers in citation networks. Analyzing the network constructed from the unArXiv dataset, we found that paper rankings can be significantly influenced by citation intent. All four centrality metrics examined- degree, PageRank, closeness, and betweenness - were sensitive to the filtering of citation types. The betweenness centrality displayed the greatest sensitivity, showing substantial changes in ranking when specific citation intents were removed.</description>

      <title>SAGraph: A Large-Scale Social Graph Dataset with Comprehensive Context for Influencer Selection in Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influencer marketing campaign success heavily depends on identifying key opinion leaders who can effectively leverage their credibility and reach to promote products or services. The selecting influencers process is vital for boosting brand visibility, fostering consumer trust, and driving sales. While traditional research often simplifies complex factors like user attitudes, interaction frequency, and advertising content, into simple numerical values. However, this reductionist approach fails to capture the dynamic nature of influencer marketing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we present SAGraph, a novel comprehensive dataset from Weibo that captures multi-dimensional marketing campaign data across six product domains. The dataset encompasses 345,039 user profiles with their complete interaction histories, including 1.3M comments and 554K reposts across 44K posts, providing unprecedented granularity in influencer marketing dynamics. SAGraph uniquely integrates user profiles, content features, and temporal interaction patterns, enabling in-depth analysis of influencer marketing mechanisms. Experimental results using both traditional baselines and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the crucial role of content analysis in predicting advertising effectiveness. Our findings reveal that LLM-based approaches achieve superior performance in understanding and predicting campaign success, opening new avenues for data-driven influencer marketing strategies. We hope that this dataset will inspire further research https://github.com/xiaoqzhwhu/SAGraph/.</description>

      <title>Focused digital cohort selection from social media using the metric backbone of biomedical knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media data allows researchers to construct large digital cohorts to study the interplay between human behavior and medical treatment.Identifying the users most relevant to a specific health problem is, however, a challenge in that social media sites vary in the generality of their discourse. To filter relevant users on any social media, we have developed a general method and tested it on epilepsy discourse. We analyzed the text from posts by users who mention epilepsy drugs at least once in the general-purpose social media sites X and Instagram, the epilepsy-focused Reddit subgroup (r/Epilepsy), and the Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA) forums. We used a curated medical terminology dictionary to generate a knowledge graph (KG) from each social media site, whereby nodes represent terms, and edge weights denote the strength of association between pairs of terms in the collected text. Our method is based on computing the metric backbone of each KG, which yields the subgraph of edges that participate in shortest paths. By comparing the subset of users who contribute to the backbone to the subset who do not, we show that epilepsy-focused social media users contribute to the KG backbone in much higher proportion than do general-purpose social media users. Furthermore, using human annotation of Instagram posts, we demonstrate that users who do not contribute to the backbone are much more likely to use dictionary terms in a manner inconsistent with their biomedical meaning and are rightly excluded from the cohort of interest.</description>

      <title>Evaluating link prediction: New perspectives and recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is an important problem in network science and machine learning research. The state-of-the-art LP methods are usually evaluated in a uniform setup, ignoring several factors associated with the data and application specific needs. We identify a number of such factors, such as, network-type, problem-type, geodesic distance between the end nodes and its distribution over the classes, nature and applicability of LP methods, class imbalance and its impact on early retrieval, evaluation metric, etc., and present an experimental setup which allows us to evaluate LP methods in a rigorous and controlled manner. We perform extensive experiments with a variety of LP methods over real network datasets in this controlled setup, and gather valuable insights on the interactions of these factors with the performance of LP through an array of carefully designed hypotheses. Following the insights, we provide recommendations to be followed as best practice for evaluating LP methods.</description>

      <title>Homophily Enhanced Graph Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. In this paper, we highlight the significance of graph homophily, a pivotal factor for graph domain alignment, which, however, has long been overlooked in existing approaches. Specifically, our analysis first reveals that homophily discrepancies exist in benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that homophily discrepancies degrade GDA performance from both empirical and theoretical aspects, which further underscores the importance of homophily alignment in GDA. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel homophily alignment algorithm that employs mixed filters to smooth graph signals, thereby effectively capturing and mitigating homophily discrepancies between graphs. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Random Walk Diffusion for Efficient Large-Scale Graph Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph generation addresses the problem of generating new graphs that have a data distribution similar to real-world graphs. While previous diffusion-based graph generation methods have shown promising results, they often struggle to scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose ARROW-Diff (AutoRegressive RandOm Walk Diffusion), a novel random walk-based diffusion approach for efficient large-scale graph generation. Our method encompasses two components in an iterative process of random walk sampling and graph pruning. We demonstrate that ARROW-Diff can scale to large graphs efficiently, surpassing other baseline methods in terms of both generation time and multiple graph statistics, reflecting the high quality of the generated graphs.</description>

      <title>Does Graph Prompt Work? A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635</link>

Abstract: In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Graph Perspective to Probe Structural Patterns of Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability. However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge. Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior performance.</description>
