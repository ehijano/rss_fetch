      <title>Theoretical Framework for Temporal Changes in Interactions among Adaptive Components of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In living systems, each component adaptively changes its internal states in response to its interactions with other components. These interactions, in turn, undergo temporal changes as a result of this adaptive behavior, which plays a crucial role in the emergence of system-level functions. Thus, to understand how changes in interactions influence the emergence of functions by employing models of adaptive behavior, it is essential to incorporate these interaction changes into these models. In this study, we developed a theoretical framework for modeling adaptive behavior of components under temporally changing interactions by formulating these interaction changes as dynamics of energy landscapes associated with that behavior. To represent this component-level adaptive behavior, internal state changes of each component were formulated based on the generalized gradient flow of an energy landscape and its associated energy rate landscape. We expressed dynamics of these landscapes by treating environmental states surrounding each component as temporal changes related to the interaction, which were then coupled to internal state changes of the component. Through case studies using simplified models of living systems under multiple mechanical interaction conditions among components, we demonstrated that our proposed theoretical framework can represent the emergence of functions of living systems. Even without explicitly defining adaptive behavior at the system level, these functions are specified based on the dynamics of the energy and energy rate landscapes of each component.</description>

      <title>Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts -- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to 'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics, it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''</description>
