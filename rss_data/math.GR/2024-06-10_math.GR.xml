      <title>On $k$-submodular subgroups of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a natural number. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ will be called $n$-modularly embedded in $G$ if either $H$ is normal in $G$ or $H\not= \mathrm{Core}_{G}(H)$, $|G:H| =p$ and $|G/\mathrm{Core}_{G}(H)|=pq^{n}$, $q^{n}$ divides $p-1$ for some primes $p$ and $q$. Let $k$ be a fixed natural number. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ will be called $k$-submodular in $G$ if there exists a chain $H = H_{0} \leq H_{1} \leq \cdots \leq H_{m-1} \leq H_{m} = G$ of subgroups such that $H_{i-1}$ is $n$-modularly embedded in $H_{i}$ for some natural $n\leq k$ and every $i = 1, \ldots , m$. In this article, properties of $k$-submodular subgroups and classes of groups with given systems of $k$-submodular subgroups are obtained.</description>

      <title>A classification of module braces over the ring of $\mathbf{p}$-adic integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the $R$-braces $(M,+,\circ)$ such that $M\cdot M$ is cyclic, where $R$ is the ring of $p$-adic and $\cdot$ is the product of the radical $R$-algebra associated to $M$. In particular, we give a classification up to isomorphism in the torsion-free case and up to isoclinism in the torsion case. More precisely, the isomorphism classes and the isoclinism classes of such radical algebras are in correspondence with particular equivalence classes of the bilinear forms defined starting from the products of the algebras.</description>

      <title>Orbits and characters associated with rook placements for Sylow $p$-subgroups of finite orthogonal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup in a classical group over a finite field of characteristic $p$. The coadjoint orbits of the group $U$ play the key role in the description of irreducible complex characters of $U$. Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we study such orbits for the orthogonal group. We construct a polarization for the canonical form on such an orbit and present a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method. As a corollary, we compute the dimension of an orbit associated with an orthogonal rook placement.</description>

      <title>The automorphism groups of small affine rank 3 graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rank 3 graph is an orbital graph of a rank 3 permutation group of even order. Despite the classification of rank 3 graphs being complete, see, e.g., Chapter 11 of the recent monograph 'Strongly regular graphs' by Brouwer and Van Maldeghem, the full automorphism groups of these graphs (equivalently, the 2-closures of rank 3 groups) have not been explicitly described, though a lot of information on this subject is available. In the present note, we address this problem for the affine rank 3 graphs. We find the automorphism groups for finitely many relatively small graphs and show that modulo known results, this provides the full description of the automorphism groups of the affine rank 3 graphs, thus reducing the general problem to the case when the socle of the automorphism group is nonabelian simple.</description>

      <title>The Choquet-Deny Property for Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A countable discrete group is called Choquet-Deny if for any non-degenerate probability measure on the group, the corresponding space of bounded harmonic functions is trivial. Building on the previous work of Jaworski, a complete characterization of Choquet-Deny groups was recently achieved by Frisch, Hartman, Tamuz, and Ferdowski. In this article, we extend the study of the Choquet-Deny property to the framework of discrete measured groupoids. Our primary result offers a complete characterization of this property in terms of the isotropy groups and the equivalence relation associated with the given groupoid. Additionally, we use the implications derived from our main theorem to classify the Choquet-Deny property of transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of $E$-unitary and $R_1$-injective special inverse monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the structure of general subgroups (in particular maximal subgroups, also known as group $\mathcal{H}$-classes) of special inverse monoids. Recent research of the authors has established that these can be quite wild, but in this paper we show that if we restrict to special inverse monoids which are $E$-unitary (or have a weaker property we call $\mathcal{R}_1$-injectivity), the maximal subgroups are strongly governed by the group of units. In particular, every maximal subgroup has a finite index subgroup which embeds in the group of units. We give a construction to show that every finite group can arise as a maximal subgroup in an $\mathcal{R}_1$-injective special inverse monoid with trivial group of units. It remains open whether every combination of a group $G$ and finite index subgroup $H$ can arise as maximal subgroup and group of units.</description>

      <title>On a Completion of Cohomological Functors Generalising Tate Cohomology I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewing group cohomology as a so-called cohomological functor, G. Mislin has generalised Tate cohomology from finite groups to all discrete groups by defining a completion for cohomological functors in [27]. If $T^{\bullet}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is any cohomological functor, then we construct its Mislin completion $\widehat{T}^{\bullet}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ under the assumption that the abelian category $\mathcal{C}$ has enough projectives and that in the abelian category $\mathcal{D}$ all countable direct limits exist and are exact. This takes Tate cohomology to settings where it has never been introduced such as in condensed mathematics. Through the latter, one can define Tate cohomology for any $T1$ topological group. More specifically, we generalise four constructions of Mislin completions from the literature, prove that they yield isomorphic cohomological functors and provide explicit formulae for their connecting homomorphisms. For any morphism $f: M \rightarrow N$ in $\mathcal{C}$ we develop formulae for $\widehat{T}^n(f): \widehat{T}^n(M) \rightarrow \widehat{T}^n(N)$ in terms of each construction.</description>

      <title>On a Completion of Cohomological Functors Generalising Tate Cohomology II</title>

Abstract: Viewing group cohomology as a so-called cohomological functor, G. Mislin has generalised Tate cohomology from finite groups to all discrete groups by defining a completion for cohomological functors in [24]. For any cohomological functor $T^{\bullet}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ we have constructed its Mislin completion $\widehat{T}^{\bullet}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ in [15] under mild assumptions on the abelian categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ which generalises Tate cohomology to all $T1$ topological groups. In this paper we investigate the properties of Mislin completions. As their main feature, Mislin completions of Ext-functors detect finite projective dimension of objects in the domain category. We establish a version of dimension shifting, an Eckmann-Shapiro result as well as cohomology products such as external products, cup products and Yoneda products.</description>

      <title>A Subexponential Quantum Algorithm for the Semidirect Discrete Logarithm Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02814v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group-based cryptography is a relatively unexplored family in post-quantum cryptography, and the so-called Semidirect Discrete Logarithm Problem (SDLP) is one of its most central problems. However, the complexity of SDLP and its relationship to more well-known hardness problems, particularly with respect to its security against quantum adversaries, has not been well understood and was a significant open problem for researchers in this area. In this paper we give the first dedicated security analysis of SDLP. In particular, we provide a connection between SDLP and group actions, a context in which quantum subexponential algorithms are known to apply. We are therefore able to construct a subexponential quantum algorithm for solving SDLP, thereby classifying the complexity of SDLP and its relation to known computational problems.</description>

      <title>Hypertrace and entropy gap characterizations of property (T) for $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a hypertrace characterization of property (T) for $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors: Given a $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors $M$, $M$ does not have property (T) if and only if there exists a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with $M\subset \mathcal{A}$ such that $\mathcal{A}$ admits a $M$-hypertrace but no normal hypertrace. For $M$ without property (T), such an inclusion $M\subset \mathcal{A}$ also admits almost vanishing Furstenberg entropy. With the same construction of $M\subset \mathcal{A}$, we also establish similar characterizations of Haagerup property for $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors.</description>
