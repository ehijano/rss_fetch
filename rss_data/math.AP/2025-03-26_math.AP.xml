      <title>Weighted fractional Hardy-Sobolev and Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities with singularities on flat submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sharp constant for weighted fractional Hardy inequalities with the singularity on a flat submanifold of codimension $k$, where $1\leq k&lt;d$. We also prove a weighted fractional Hardy inequality with a remainder. Using this result, we extend and derive a weighted version of the fractional Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequality with singularities on a flat submanifold. Furthermore, we obtain a weighted logarithmic fractional Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequality in the case of a singularity at the origin and we show that in this case, the fractional Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequality does not hold.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Dirichlet problem using a weaker Carleson condition in the upper half plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half plane $\mathbb{R}^2_+$. There are several conditions on the behavior of the matrix $A$ in the transversal $t$-direction that yield $\omega\in A_\infty(\sigma)$. These include the $t$-independence condition, a mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ condition on $\partial_t A$, and Dini-type conditions. We introduce an $L^1$ Carleson condition on $\partial_t A(x,t)$ that extends the class of elliptic operators for which we have $\omega\in A_\infty(\sigma)$, i.e. solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for some $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>An inverse Problem for the cubic $\alpha$-NLS in Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address an inverse problem for a defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation in dimensions $d\in\{1, 2,3\}$ in a range of Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ by employing the method of approximate solutions. We recover a smooth, space-dependent and compactly supported function $\alpha$ that controls the nonlinearity (and thus self-interaction strength) in a multiplicative fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work based on approximate solutions in Sobolev spaces that treats an inverse problem for the NLS and provides explicit recovery of $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Global minimizers for fast diffusion versus nonlocal interactions on negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of ground states for a free energy functional on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. The energy, which consists of an entropy and an interaction term, is associated to a macroscopic aggregation model that includes nonlinear diffusion and nonlocal interactions. We consider specifically the regime of fast diffusion, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the behaviour of the interaction potential for global energy minimizers to exist. We first consider the case of manifolds with constant bounds of sectional curvatures, then extend the results to manifolds with general curvature bounds. To establish our results we derive several new Carlson-Levin type inequalities for Cartan-Hadamard manifolds.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for a chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes model with potential consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work deals with a Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with potential consumption, under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for both the cell density and the chemical signal, and of Dirichlet type for the velocity field, over a bounded three-dimensional domain. The cases where there is no fluid flow, or the consumption has a linear rate have been previously dealt with. This work then handles the so far open question of whether global solutions exist for this system. The solution is obtained through a time discretization approach and a regularization of the system, using suitable truncations. Minimal conditions on the boundary of the domain are required.</description>

      <title>The global existence and blowup of the classical solution to the relativistic dust in a FLRW geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the global existence and blowup of the classical solution to the Cauchy problem of the relativistic Euler equation
  with $ p=0 $ in a fixed Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. The aim of this work is to study clearly the effect of the expansion rate of the spacetime on the life span of the classical solution to the pressureless fluid. Since the density and the velocity of the relativistic dust admits the same principal part, we can obtain much more accurate results by the characteristic method rather than energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the Free Boundary Incompressible Porous Media Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free boundary incompressible porous media equation which describes the dynamics of a density transported by a Darcy flow in the field of gravity, with a free boundary between the fluid region and the dry region above it. For any stratified density state, we identify a stability condition for the initial free boundary. Under this condition, we prove that small localized perturbations of the stratified density lead to unique local-in-time solutions in Sobolev spaces.
  Our proof involves analytic ingredients that are of independent interest, including tame fractional Sobolev estimates for operators that map the Dirichlet boundary function and the forcing function of Poisson's equation to its solution in domains of Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a second order, linear, fully decoupled, and unconditionally energy stable scheme for solving the Erickson-Leslie model. This approach integrates the pressure correction method with a scalar auxiliary variable technique. We rigorously demonstrate the unconditional energy stability of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we present several numerical experiments to validate its convergence order, stability, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Global small data weak solutions of 2-D semilinear wave equations with scale-invariant damping, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $2$-D semilinear wave equation with scale-invariant damping $\partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$, where $t\geq 1$ and $p&gt;1$, in the paper [T. Imai, M. Kato, H. Takamura, K. Wakasa, The lifespan of solutions of semilinear wave equations with the scale-invariant damping in two space dimensions, J. Differential Equations 269 (2020), no. 10, 8387-8424], it is conjectured that the global small data weak solution $u$ exists when $p&gt;p_{s}(2+\mu) =\frac{\mu+3+\sqrt{\mu^2+14\mu+17}}{2(\mu+1)}$ for $\mu\in (0, 2)$ and $p&gt;p_f(2)=2$ for $\mu\geq 2$. In our previous paper, the global small solution $u$ has been obtained for $p_{s}(2+\mu)&lt;p&lt;p_{conf}(2,\mu)=\frac{\mu+5}{\mu+1}$ and $\mu\in(0,1)\cup(1,2)$. In the present paper, we will show the global existence of small solution $u$ for $p\geq p_{conf}(2,\mu)$ and $\mu\in(0,1)\cup(1,2)$. Therefore, the conjecture on the critical Strauss index $p_{s}(2+\mu)$ has been solved in the case of $\mu\in (0,1)\cup (1, 2)$.</description>

      <title>Fronts in dissipative Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a dissipative Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain particles interact with their nearest neighbors through anharmonic potentials and linear dissipative forces. We prove the existence of front solutions connecting two different uniformly compressed (or stretched) states at $\pm \infty$ using an implicit function argument starting at a suitable continuum limit in the case of large damping. A detailed analysis allows us to show monotonicity of waves and to determine sharp exponential decay rates for a wide class of potentials including Hertzian potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of determining a Signorini obstacle from boundary measurements for the isotropic elasticity system. We prove that the obstacle can be uniquely determined by a single measurement of displacement and normal stress for the Signorini problem on an open subset of the boundary up to a natural obstruction. In addition to considering the Signorini problem, we develop techniques that can be used to study inverse problems for general differential inequalities.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of smooth solutions to the subcritical EPDiff equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the EPDiff equation on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the integer-order homogeneous Sobolev inertia operator $A=(-\Delta)^k$. We prove that for arbitrary radial initial data and a sign condition on the initial momentum, the corresponding radial velocity solution has $C^1$ norm that blows up in finite time whenever $0\le k&lt;n/2+1.$ Our approach is to use Lagrangian coordinates to formulate EPDiff as an ODE on a Banach space, enabling us to use a comparison estimate with the Liouville equation. Along the way we derive the Green function in terms of hypergeometric functions and discuss their properties. This is a step toward proving the general conjecture that the EPDiff equation is globally well-posed for any Sobolev inertia operator of any real order $k$ if and only if $k\ge n/2+1$.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Analysis of Energy Distribution Networks using Finite Volume Method and Interpolatory Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy distribution networks are crucial for human societies and since they often cover large geographical areas, their physical analysis is challenging. Modeling and simulation can be used to analyze such complex energy networks. In this paper, we performed discretization on the underlying partial differential equations of a pipeline and identified the complete network model for the gas, water and power distribution network. The discretized network model can be represented in a unified state-space form, that is, a specific matrix vector form for a set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Due to the size and complexity of these models, their simulation can be computationally expensive. To address this issue, we applied model order reduction to the original unified mathematical model, constructing a reduced-order model that approximates the behavior of the original model with minimal computational cost. Specifically, we utilize the tangential iterative rational Krylov algorithm (tIRKA) which ensure that the interpolation condition of the linear part of the original and the reduced nonlinear unified models are interpolating along the predefined tangent directions. A specific scenario of the energy network is simulated with and without model order reduction and the behaviour is observed in terms of its performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a porous medium equation that models tissue growth in a heterogeneous environment. We show that, in the incompressible limit, solutions converge to those of a weak form of a Hele-Shaw type free boundary problem. To obtain enough compactness to take the limit, we establish an $L^4$ bound on the gradient of the pressure and an estimate of Aronson-B\'{e}nilan type.</description>

      <title>Principal spectral rigidity implies subprincipal spectral rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse spectral problem of jointly recovering a radially symmetric Riemannian metric and an additional coefficient from the Dirichlet spectrum of a perturbed Laplace-Beltrami operator on a bounded domain. Specifically, we consider the elliptic operator \[ L_{a,b} := e^{a-b} \nabla \cdot e^b \nabla \] on the unit ball $ B \subset \mathbb{R}^3 $, where the scalar functions $ a = a(|x|) $ and $ b = b(|x|) $ are spherically symmetric and satisfy certain geometric conditions. While the function $ a $ influences the principal symbol of $ L $, the function $ b $ appears in its first-order terms. We investigate the extent to which the Dirichlet eigenvalues of $ L_{a,b} $ uniquely determine the pair $ (a, b) $ and establish spectral rigidity results under suitable assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the $\Gamma$-limit of weighted fractional energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $p\in[1,\infty)$ and a bounded open set $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ with Lipschitz boundary, we study the $\Gamma$-convergence of the weighted fractional seminorm \[ [u]_{s,p,f}^p = \int_{\mathbb R^d} \int_{\mathbb R^d} \frac{|\tilde{u}(x)- \tilde{u}(y)|^p}{\|x-y\|^{d+sp}}\,f(x)\,f(y)\,\mathrm{d} x\,\mathrm{d} y \] as $s\to1^-$ for $u\in L^p(\Omega)$, where $\tilde{u}=u$ on $\Omega$ and $\tilde{u}=0$ on $\mathbb R^d\setminus\Omega$. Assuming that $(f_s)_{s\in(0,1)}\subset L^\infty(\mathbb R^d;[0,\infty))$ and $f\in\mathrm{Lip}_b(\mathbb R^d;(0,\infty))$ are such that $f_s\to f$ in $L^\infty(\mathbb R^d)$ as $s\to1^-$, we show that $(1-s)[u]_{s,p,f_s}$ $\Gamma$-converges to the Dirichlet $p$-energy weighted by $f^2$. In the case $p=2$, we also prove the convergence of the corresponding gradient flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the parabolic version of the celebrated Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem. As applications, we obtain new characterizations of parabolic BMO-type spaces in terms of various commutators of parabolic fractional operators with time lag. The key tools to achieve these include to establish the appropriate form in the parabolic setting of the parabolic Rubio de Francia iteration algorithm, the Cauchy integral trick, and a modified Fourier series expansion argument adapted to the parabolic geometry. The novelty of these results lies in the fact that, for the first time, we not only introduce a new class of commutators associated with parabolic fractional integral operators with time lag, but also utilize them to provide a characterization of the parabolic BMO-type space in the high-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Extension principles for the Einstein Yang--Mills system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an extension principle for the spherically symmetric Einstein Yang--Mills system (SSEYM) with $H^1$ data. Based on this result, we further prove an extension theorem for developments of weighted $H^1$ data. In particular, the weighted $H^1$ space allows H\"{o}lder continuous data. Therefore, our result is consistence with the conjecture that well-posedness holds for H\"{o}lder continuous data (with sufficiently many angular derivatives) in vacuum where the axis is included.
  In contrast to a massless scalar field, the purely magnetic Yang--Mills field in spherical symmetry satisfies a wave-type equation with singular potential. The proof of Christodoulou [10], based on an $L^\infty-L^\infty$ estimate, fails for the Yang--Mills scenario. Instead, we employ the $L^2$ method, which works for the (massless or massive) scalar matter field as well.</description>

      <title>Stochastic exit-time control on the half-line over a finite horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite-time stochastic drift control problem with the assumption that the control is bounded and the system is controlled until the state process leaves the half-line. Assuming general conditions, it is proved that the resulting parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation has a classical solution. In fact, we consider an even more general family of semilinear equations, which might be helpful in solving other control or game problems. Not only is the existence result proved, but also a recursive procedure for finding a solution resulting from a fixed-point argument is provided. An application to the dividend optimization problem is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper employs the Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem to investigate the existence of periodic solutions in blood flow propagating through vessels with free boundary conditions. It is rigorously proved that a local $C^1$-curve of small-amplitude periodic solutions is bifurcated. In contrast to previous studies on periodic flows that primarily focus on constant vorticity, our work emphasizes the bifurcation analysis of periodic solutions in blood flow with harmonic vorticity distribution and external body forces.</description>

Abstract: We generalize a result by Alberti, showing that, if a first-order linear differential operator $\mathcal{A}$ belongs to a certain class, then any $L^1$ function is the absolutely continuous part of a measure $\mu$ satisfying $\mathcal{A}\mu=0$. When $\mathcal{A}$ is scalar valued, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the above property to hold true and we prove dimensional estimates on the singular part of $\mu$. Finally, we show that operators in the above class satisfy a Lusin-type property.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the qualitative aspects of dark solitons of one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with general nonlocal interactions, which correspond to traveling waves with subsonic speeds. Under general conditions on the potential interaction term, we provide uniform bounds, demonstrate the existence of symmetric solitons, and identify conditions under which monotonicity is lost. Additionally, we present new properties of black solitons. Moreover, we establish the nonlocal-to-local convergence, i.e. the convergence of the soliton of the nonlocal model toward the explicit dark solitons of the local Gross-Pitaevskii equation.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of elasto-plastic evolutions driven by the flow of dislocations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a prototypical model of elasto-plasticity in the small-strain and quasi-static setting, where the evolution of the plastic distortion is driven exclusively by the motion of discrete dislocations, this work performs a rigorous homogenization procedure to a model involving continuously-distributed dislocation fields. Our main result shows the existence of rate-independent evolutions driven by the motion of dislocation fields, obtained as limits of discrete dislocation evolutions. For all notions of solutions we employ the recent concepts of space-time integral and normal currents, which is richer than the classical approach using the Kr\"oner dislocation density tensor. The key technical challenge is to find discrete dislocation evolutions approximating a given dislocation field evolution, which requires a careful recovery construction of space-time slip trajectories and associated displacements. These methods enable one to transfer the properties, most importantly the quasi-static stability, from the discrete to the field regime.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of hyperbolic-parabolic free boundary problems modelling biofilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the stability analysis of two free boundary problems arising in biofilm modelling. The first, introduced in the 1980s by Wanner and Gujer, is related to the competition between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in a biofilm bioreactor. It is a free boundary problem consisting of a system of hyperbolic PDEs modelling biofilm growth and the competition between species, a parabolic system accounting for substrate consumption, and an ODE for biofilm thickness.
  The second, also based on the former, arises from the modelling of trace-metal precipitation in biofilms, with a special focus on the role of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the methane production process.
  The analysis is made into two steps, the first one being the existence and uniqueness of the stationary solutions. The second one allows to show that the calssical solutions converge to the stationary solutions by using a semigroup approach and the energy method.
  We also extend the study to the precipitation model, in which the substrates are modelled by a parabolic system with variable diffusion coefficients.</description>

Abstract: This work presents the existence and uniqueness of solution to a free boundary value problem related to biofilm growth. The problem consists of a system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations governing the microbial species growth, and a system of parabolic partial differential equations describing the substrate dynamics. The free boundary evolution is governed by an ordinary differential equation that accounts for the thickness of the biofilm. We use the method of characteristics and fixed point strategies to prove the existence and uniqueness theorem in small and all times. All the equations are converted into integral equations, in particular this transformation is made for the parabolic equations by using the Green's functions. We consider Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Robin boundary conditions for the substrates equations and their extension to the case with variable</description>

      <title>Stability Estimates in Kinetic Wasserstein Distances for the Vlasov-Poisson System with Yudovich Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system using the unifying framework of the kinetic Wasserstein distance, introduced by Iacobelli in (Section 4 in Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 244 (2022), no. 1, 27-50). This allows us to treat both macroscopic densities that lie in a Yudovich space, as recently considered by Crippa et al. (Theorem 1.6 in Nonlinearity 37 (2024), no. 9, 095015) for the $1$-Wasserstein distance, and higher order Wasserstein distances, for which only bounded macroscopic densities were treated by Iacobelli and the first author (Theorem 1.11 in Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 56 (2024), 2250-2267). First, we establish an $L^p$-estimate on the difference between two force fields in terms of a suitable nonlinear quantity that controls the kinetic Wasserstein distance between their macroscopic densities. Second, we use this estimate in order to derive a closable Osgood-type inequality for the kinetic Wasserstein distance between two solutions. This enables us to prove our main theorem; for $1 \le p &lt; +\infty$ we show the $p$-Wasserstein stability of solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system with macroscopic densities belonging to a Yudovich space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider second order degenerate parabolic equations with complex, measurable, and time-dependent coefficients. The degenerate ellipticity is dictated by a spatial $A_2$-weight. We prove that having a generalized fundamental solution with upper Gaussian bounds is equivalent to Moser's $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimates for local weak solutions. In the special case of real coefficients, Moser's $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimates are known, which provide an easier proof of Gaussian upper bounds, and a known Harnack inequality is then used to derive Gaussian lower bounds.</description>

Abstract: The green functions for the heat and Laplace equations with dynamical boundary conditions in a ball are studied. First, the green functions of the Laplace equation with a dynamical boundary condition are given, and the properties of related heat kernels are discussed. Then using these ingredients, two complementary approximations to the heat equation with a dynamical boundary condition in a ball are constructed, including an approximation of green function and an approximation of solution. Moreover, the green function of the heat equation with a dynamical boundary condition is implicitly presented by a series of eigenfunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (D-to-N map) $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ on the exterior of the disk with respect to a magnetic potential $A_{b, \nu}=A^b + A_\nu$ where, for $b\in \mathbb R$ and $\nu \in \mathbb R$, $A^b (x,y)= b\, (-y, x)$ and $A_\nu (x,y)$ is the Aharonov-Bohm potential centered at the origin of flux $2\pi \nu$. First, we show that the limit of $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ as $b\rightarrow 0$ is equal to the D-to-N map $\widehat \Lambda (\nu)$ on the interior of the disk associated with the potential $A_\nu (x,y)$. Secondly, we study the ground state energy of the D-to-N map $\check \Lambda(b,\nu)$ and show that the strong diamagnetism property holds. Finally we slightly extend to the exterior case the asymptotic results obtained in the interior case for general domains.</description>

      <title>Global Hypoellipticity and Solvability with Loss of Derivatives on the Torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete characterization of global hypoellipticity and solvability with loss of derivatives for Fourier multiplier operators on the $n$-dimensional torus. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for these properties and examine their connections with classical notions of global hypoellipticity and solvability, particularly in relation to the closedness of the operator's range.
  As an application, we explore the interplay between these properties and number theory in the context of differential operators on the two-torus. Specifically, we prove that the loss of derivatives in the solvability of the vector field $\partial_{x_1} - \alpha \partial_{x_2}$ is precisely determined by the well-known irrationality measure $\mu(\alpha)$ of its coefficient $\alpha$. Furthermore, we analyze the wave operator $\partial_{x_1}^2 - \eta^2 \Delta_{\mathbb{T}^n}$ and show how the loss of derivatives depends explicitly on the parameter $\eta &gt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a $C^r$ semiflow $\{ \varphi_t \}_{t \geq 0}$ on a Banach space $X$ admitting a stable fixed point $x$. We show, along the lines of the parameterization method (Cabr\'e et al., 2003), the existence of a $C^r$ invariant foliation tangent to $X_1$ at $x$, for an arbitrary $D \varphi_t(x)$-invariant subspace $X_1 \subset X$ satisfying some additional spectral conditions. Uniqueness ensues in a subclass of sufficiently smooth invariant foliations tangent to $X_1$ at $x$. We then draw relations to Koopman theory, and thereby establish the existence and uniqueness, in some appropriate sense, of $C^r$ Koopman eigenfunctions. We demonstrate that these results apply to the case of the Navier-Stokes system, the archetypal example considered by the modern upheaval of applied 'Koopmanism'.</description>

      <title>On the optimal control of viscous Cahn-Hilliard systems with hyperbolic relaxation of the chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a viscous Cahn--Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions in which a hyperbolic relaxation term involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential has been added to the first equation of the system. For the initial-boundary value problem of this system, results concerning well-posedness, continuous dependence and regularity are known. We show Fr\'echet differentiability of the associated control-to-state operator, study the associated adjoint state system, and derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Concerning the nonlinearities driving the system, we can include the case of logarithmic potentials. In addition, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the optimal control problem as the relaxation coefficient approaches zero.</description>
