      <title>Evolve with Your Research -- Stepwise System Evolution from Document-driven to Fact-centric Research Data Management in Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitalisation of research requires data management systems capable of supporting a broad spectrum of usage scenarios, ranging from document-oriented repositories to fully factographic environments. This paper introduces a methodological approach for the stepwise development of such systems, illustrated by the MatInf Research Data Management System (RDMS). The proposed framework combines a graph-based STAR paradigm-emphasising Statefulness, Traceability, Aim, and Result-with the SET methodology, which enables systematic Standardisation, Extraction, and Testing of research data. Together, these principles provide a pathway towards FAIR-compliant data infrastructures, facilitating reproducibility, re-use, and integration of heterogeneous materials science data. By demonstrating the gradual consolidation of research outputs into unified datasets, this study highlights how adaptive RDMS design can support accelerated scientific discovery and enhance collaborative research in large-scale projects.</description>

      <title>CiteGuard: Faithful Citation Attribution for LLMs via Retrieval-Augmented Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising assistants for scientific writing. However, there have been concerns regarding the quality and reliability of the generated text, one of which is the citation accuracy and faithfulness. While most recent work relies on methods such as LLM-as-a-Judge, the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge alone is also in doubt. In this work, we reframe citation evaluation as a problem of citation attribution alignment, which is assessing whether LLM-generated citations match those a human author would include for the same text. We propose CiteGuard, a retrieval-aware agent framework designed to provide more faithful grounding for citation validation. CiteGuard improves the prior baseline by 12.3%, and achieves up to 65.4% accuracy on the CiteME benchmark, on par with human-level performance (69.7%). It also enables the identification of alternative but valid citations.</description>

      <title>Does GenAI Rewrite How We Write? An Empirical Study on Two-Million Preprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preprint repositories become central infrastructures for scholarly communication. Their expansion transforms how research is circulated and evaluated before journal publication. Generative large language models (LLMs) introduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are written. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs reshape scientific publishing remains limited.
  This paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1 million preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major repositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a multi-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series models, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic modeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary orientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive fields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as universal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths and widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper provides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of generative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance frameworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled research ecosystem.</description>

      <title>ORDENA: ORigin-DEstiNAtion data exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing origin-destination flows is an important problem that has been extensively investigated in several scientific fields, particularly by the visualization community. The problem becomes especially challenging when involving massive data, demanding mechanisms such as data aggregation and interactive filtering to make the exploratory process doable. However, data aggregation tends to smooth out certain patterns, and deciding which data should be filtered is not straightforward. In this work, we propose ORDENA, a visual analytic tool to explore origin and destination data. ORDENA is built upon a simple and intuitive scatter plot where the horizontal and vertical axes correspond to origins and destinations. Therefore, each origin-destination flow is represented as a point in the scatter plot. How the points are organized in the plot layout reveals important spatial phenomena present in the data. Moreover, ORDENA provides explainability resources that allow users to better understand the relation between origin-destination flows and associated attributes. We illustrate ORDENA's effectiveness in a set of case studies, which have also been elaborated in collaboration with domain experts. The proposed tool has also been evaluated by domain experts not involved in its development, which provided quite positive feedback about ORDENA.</description>

      <title>The Shift Towards Preprints in AI Policy Research: A Comparative Study of Preprint Trends in the U.S., Europe, and South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of open science has quickly changed how artificial intelligence (AI) policy research is distributed globally. This study examines the regional trends in the citation of preprints, specifically focusing on the impact of two major disruptive events: the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of ChatGPT, on research dissemination patterns in the United States, Europe, and South Korea from 2015 to 2024. Using bibliometrics data from the Web of Science, this study tracks how global disruptive events influenced the adoption of preprints in AI policy research and how such shifts vary by region. By marking the timing of these disruptive events, the analysis reveals that while all regions experienced growth in preprint citations, the magnitude and trajectory of change varied significantly. The United States exhibited sharp, event-driven increases; Europe demonstrated institutional growth; and South Korea maintained consistent, linear growth in preprint adoption. These findings suggest that global disruptions may have accelerated preprint adoption, but the extent and trajectory are shaped by local research cultures, policy environments, and levels of open science maturity. This paper emphasizes the need for future AI governance strategies to consider regional variability in research dissemination and highlights opportunities for further longitudinal and comparative research to deepen our understanding of open-access adoption in AI policy development.</description>

      <title>Innovation by Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New ideas are often thought to arise from recombining existing knowledge. Yet despite rapid publication growth - and expanding opportunities for recombination - scientific breakthroughs remain rare. This gap between productivity and progress challenges recombinant growth theory as the prevailing account of innovation. We argue that the limitation of this theory lies in treating ideas solely as complements, overlooking that breakthroughs often arise when ideas act as substitutes. To test this, we integrate scientist interviews, bibliometric validation, and machine learning analysis of 41 million papers (1965-2024). Interviews reveal that breakthroughs are marked not by novelty (Atypicality) alone but by their ability to displace dominant ideas (Disruption). Large-scale analysis confirms that novelty and disruption represent distinct innovation mechanisms: they are negatively correlated across domains, periods, team sizes, and paper versions. Novel papers extend dominant ideas across topics and attract immediate attention; disruptive papers displace them within the same topic and generate lasting influence. Hence, progress slows not from lack of effort but because most research extends rather than overturns ideas. Applying this perspective reveals distinct roles of theories and methods in scientific change: methods more often drive breakthroughs, whereas theories tend to be novel but rarely disruptive, reinforcing the dominance of established ideas.</description>
