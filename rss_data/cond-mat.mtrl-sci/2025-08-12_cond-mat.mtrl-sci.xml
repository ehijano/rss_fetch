      <title>Digital generation of the 3-D pore architecture of isotropic membranes using 2-D cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major limitation of two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in imaging porous membranes is its inability to resolve three-dimensional pore architecture and interconnectivity, which are critical factors governing membrane performance. Although conventional tomographic 3-D reconstruction techniques can address this limitation, they are often expensive, technically challenging, and not widely accessible. We previously introduced a proof-of-concept method for reconstructing a membrane's 3-D pore network from a single 2-D SEM image, yielding statistically equivalent results to those obtained from 3-D tomography. However, this initial approach struggled to replicate the diverse pore geometries commonly observed in real membranes. In this study, we advance the methodology by developing an enhanced reconstruction algorithm that not only maintains essential statistical properties (e.g., pore size distribution), but also accurately reproduces intricate pore morphologies. Applying this technique to a commercial microfiltration membrane, we generated a high-fidelity 3-D reconstruction and derived key membrane properties. Validation with X-ray tomography data revealed excellent agreement in structural metrics, with our SEM-based approach achieving superior resolution in resolving fine pore features. The tool can be readily applied to isotropic porous membrane structures of any pore size, as long as those pores can be visualized by SEM. Further work is needed for 3-D structure generation of anisotropic membranes.</description>

      <title>Potassium polytungstate nanoparticles by combustion aerosol technology for benzene sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polytungstates are oxygen-linked assemblies of highly oxidized tungsten polyhedra, valued for their tunability and stability in diverse applications. Traditional synthesis methods (hydrothermal, solvothermal, solid-state) offer material variety but are limited in scalability and their ability to yield nanostructured materials due to long reaction times and high temperatures. Here, we introduce flame aerosol synthesis as a single-step, rapid and dry method to prepare K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$ nanoparticulate powders and coatings. Thereby, monocrystalline and phase-pure K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  with varying crystal-sizes were obtained by controlling flame temperature, residence time and metal ion concentration during particle formation by nucleation, coagulation and sintering. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy identified the high potassium tolerance of the K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  lattice (K/W ratio up to 0.6) and phase stability up to 400 $^\circ$C, before other polytungstates and WO$_3$ polymorphs were formed, respectively. Porous films of such K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  nanoparticles featured n-type semiconductor behavior that was utilized for the chemoresistive quantification of the air pollutant benzene down to 0.2 parts-per-million at 20% relative humidity. Such sensors were quite selective over other compounds (e.g. alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, CO, NH$_3$ or H$_2$), in particular to chemically similar toluene and xylene (&gt;18).</description>

      <title>Role of Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Accelerating Crystalline Material Discovery: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for knowledge-intensive tasks across domains. In materials science, to find novel materials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world applications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and experiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space, minimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide an accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials structures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge from literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG in accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic review to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key materials science problems. We survey state-of-the-art developments in crystal structure prediction, defect analysis, materials discovery, literature mining, database integration, and multi-modal retrieval, highlighting how combining LLMs with external knowledge sources enables new capabilities. We discuss the performance, limitations, and implications of these approaches, and outline future directions for leveraging LLMs to accelerate materials research and discovery for advancement in technologies in the area of electronics, optics, biomedical, and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Design of high-mobility p-type GaN via the piezomobility tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium nitride (GaN) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor of significant interest for applications in solid-state lighting, power electronics, and radio-frequency amplifiers. An important limitation of this semiconductor is its low intrinsic hole mobility, which hinders the development of \textit{p}-channel devices and the large-scale integration of GaN CMOS in next-generation electronics. Prior research has explored the use of strain to improve the hole mobility of GaN, but a systematic analysis of all possible strain conditions and their impact on the mobility is lacking. In this study, we introduce a piezomobility tensor notation to characterize the relationship between applied strain and hole mobility in GaN. To map the strain-dependence of the hole mobility, we solve the \textit{ab initio} Boltzmann transport equation, accounting for electron-phonon scattering and GW quasiparticle energy corrections. We show that there exist three optimal strain configurations, two uniaxial strains and one shear strain, that can lead to significant mobility enhancement. In particular, we predict room-temperature hole mobility of up to 164~\mob\ for 2\% uniaxial compression and 148~\mob\ for 2\% shear strain. Our methodology provides a general framework for investigating strain effects on the transport properties of semiconductors from first principles.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ge substrate Thicknesses and Epitaxy Growth Conditions on the Optical and Material Properties of Ge- and GaAs-based VCSELs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of the optical and material property dependences of VCSELs on Ge or GaAs substrate thicknesses and epitaxy process conditions. It was found that adjusting the Ge substrate thickness and optimizing the epitaxy process can shift the stopband center and cavity resonance wavelength by several nanometers. Ge-based VCSELs exhibit improved epitaxial uniformity, smaller deviations from design specifications, reduced stoichiometry variations, and strain magnitudes comparable to those of GaAs-based counterparts. In the selected 46.92 square micron sample area, no defects were observed in the quantum well (QW) regions of Ge-based VCSELs, and the threading dislocation density (TDD) was measured to be below 2.13e6 per square cm. These results highlight the potential of Ge substrates as promising candidates for advanced VCSELs.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundaries in Ceramic Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now widely accepted that grain boundaries play a critical role in the performance and reliability of solid-state batteries with lithium metal anodes. Understanding and controlling grain boundaries is essential for enabling safe, high-rate operation of solid-state batteries. This review explores the multifaceted influence of grain boundaries in ceramic solid electrolytes and metal anodes, including their impact on ionic and electronic transport, dendrite and void formation, connecting them to the failure mechanisms. We discuss the formation and structure of space charge layers at grain boundaries, their role in modulating local defect chemistry, and the conditions under which grain boundaries may serve as fast-ion pathways or as vulnerable sites for failure. We highlight key differences in the grain boundaries of different classes of solid electrolytes and advances in modeling, experimental characterization, and processing techniques to understand the complexity and engineer grain boundaries in solid electrolytes. Finally, we outline key open questions and opportunities for grain boundary engineering to stimulate further progress in the field.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio heat transport in defect-laden quasi-1D systems from a symmetry-adapted perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their aspect ratio and wide range of thermal conductivities, nanotubes hold significant promise as heat-management nanocomponents. Their practical use is, however, often limited by thermal resistance introduced by structural defects or material interfaces. An intriguing question is the role that structural symmetry plays in thermal transport through those defect-laden sections. To address this, we develop a framework that combines representation theory with the mode-resolved Green's function method, enabling a detailed, symmetry-resolved analysis of phonon transmission through defected segments of quasi-1D systems. To avoid artifacts inherent to formalisms developed for bulk 3D systems, we base our analysis on line groups, the appropriate description of the symmetries of quasi-1D structures. This categorization introduces additional quantum numbers that partition the phonon branches into smaller, symmetry-distinct subsets, enabling clearer mode classification. We employ an Allegro-based machine learning potential to obtain the force constants and phonons with near-ab-initio accuracy. We calculate detailed phonon transmission profiles for single- and multi-layer MoS$_\mathrm{2}$-WS$_\mathrm{2}$ nanotubes and connect the transmission probability of each mode to structural symmetry. Surprisingly, we find that pronounced symmetry breaking can suppress scattering by relaxing selection rules and opening additional transmission channels. That higher disorder introduced through defects can enhance thermal transport, and not just suppress it, demonstrates the critical role of symmetry in deciphering the nuances of nanoscale thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Puzzle of Brittleness in Single Crystal Iridium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iridium is critical for extreme-environment applications due to its exceptional thermal stability and corrosion resistance, but its intrinsic brittleness remains a decades-old puzzle. Combining atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, density first-principles calculations, and discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, we identify high-density, sessile Frank dislocation loops with zero-net Burgers vectors as the key mechanism. These loops form via an energetically favorable transformation from mixed perfect dislocations under stress, a process unique to iridium among face-centered cubic metals. The immobile loops act as potent barriers, drastically increasing yield strength and work hardening by impeding dislocation glide and consuming mobile dislocations. This dominance of these findings deepens the understanding of iridium's brittleness and offers a pathway for designing more ductile variants of this critical material.</description>

      <title>Efficient GW calculations for metals from an accurate ab initio polarizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its success in the study of spectroscopic properties, the $GW$ method presents specific methodological challenges when applied to systems with metallic screening. Here, we present an efficient and fully ab-initio implementation for the calculation of the screened potential, specifically designed for 3D and 2D metals. It combines a Monte Carlo integration with an appropriate interpolation of the screened potential between the calculated grid points (W-av), complemented with an extrapolation to the long-wavelength limit, able to seamlessly account for the so-called intraband term. This method greatly accelerates the convergence of GW calculations for metals while improving their accuracy, due to the correct description of the intraband transitions in the long wavelength limit, as shown here for 3D metals and doped monolayers, such as MoS$_2$ and graphene. The use of W-av results in an excellent agreement with ARPES measurements for monolayer doped MoS$_2$. Furthermore, for graphene we show that more robust results are found with the use of higher-order Lorentzians in the description of the self-energy, together with the solution of the QP equation beyond the linearized approximation.</description>

      <title>Coulombic control of charge transfer in luminescent radicals with long-lived quartet states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in organic materials are emerging as an attractive platform for tunable quantum technologies. Structures with near-degenerate doublet and triplet excitations in linked trityl radical, acene and carbazole units can host quartet states. These high spin states can be coherently manipulated, and later decay radiatively via the radical doublet transition. However, this requires controlling the deexcitation pathways of all metastable states. Here we establish design rules for efficient quartet generation in luminescent radicals, using different connection arrangements of the molecular units. We discover that electronic coupling strength between these units dictates luminescence and quartet formation yields, particularly through the energetics of an acene-radical charge transfer state, which we tune Coulombically. This state acts as a source of non-radiative decay when acene-radical separation is small, but facilitates doublet-quartet spin interconversion when acene-radical separation is large. Using these rules we report a radical-carbazole-acene material with 55% luminescence yield, where 94% of emitting excitons originate from the quartet at microsecond times. This reveals the central role of molecular topology in luminescent quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Anisotropic Crystallization and Phase Transitions under Van der Waals Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical confinement strategies, such as van der Waals (vdW) squeezing, have emerged as promising routes for synthesizing non-vdW two-dimensional (2D) layers, surprisingly yielding high-quality single crystals with lateral sizes approaching 100 micrometer. However, the underlying mechanisms by which such a straightforward approach overcomes the long-standing synthesis challenges of non-vdW 2D materials remains a puzzle. Here, we investigate the crystallization dynamics and phase evolution of Bi under vdW confinement through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations powered by a machine-learning force filed fine-tuned and distilled from a pre-trained model with DFT-level accuracy. We reveal that pressure-dependent layer modulation arises from a quantum confinement-driven anisotropic crystallization mechanism, in which out-of-plane layering occurs nearly two orders of magnitude faster than in-plane ordering. Two critical transitions are identified: an alpha-to-beta phase transformation at 1.64 GPa, and a subsequent collapse into a single-atomic layer at 2.19 GPa. The formation of large-area single crystals is enabled by substrate-induced orientational selection and accelerated grain boundary migration, driven by atomic diffusion at elevated temperatures. These findings resolve the mechanistic origin of high-quality 2D crystal growth under confinement and establish guiding principles for the controlled synthesis of metastable 2D single crystals, with implications for next-generation quantum and nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore machine learning techniques for predicting Curie temperatures of magnetic materials using the NEMAD database. By augmenting the dataset with composition-based and domain-aware descriptors, we evaluate the performance of several machine learning models. We find that the Extra Trees Regressor delivers the best performance reaching an R^2 score of up to 0.85 $\pm$ 0.01 (cross-validated) for a balanced dataset. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm to gain insights into the performance of chemically distinct material groups. Furthermore, we perform the SHAP analysis to identify key physicochemical drivers of Curie behavior, such as average atomic number and magnetic moment. By employing explainable AI techniques, this analysis offers insights into the model's predictive behavior, thereby advancing scientific interpretability.</description>

      <title>VASPilot: MCP-Facilitated Multi-Agent Intelligence for Autonomous VASP Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-functional-theory (DFT) simulations with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) are indispensable in computational materials science but often require extensive manual setup, monitoring, and postprocessing. Here, we introduce VASPilot, an open-source platform that fully automates VASP workflows via a multi-agent architecture built on the CrewAI framework and a standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP). VASPilot's agent suite handles every stage of a VASP study-from retrieving crystal structures and generating input files to submitting Slurm jobs, parsing error messages, and dynamically adjusting parameters for seamless restarts. A lightweight Flask-based web interface provides intuitive task submission, real-time progress tracking, and drill-down access to execution logs, structure visualizations, and plots. We validate VASPilot on both routine and advanced benchmarks: automated band-structure and density-of-states calculations (including on-the-fly symmetry corrections), plane-wave cutoff convergence tests, lattice-constant optimizations with various van der Waals corrections, and cross-material band-gap comparisons for transition-metal dichalcogenides. In all cases, VASPilot completed the missions reliably and without manual intervention. Moreover, its modular design allows easy extension to other DFT codes simply by deploying the appropriate MCP server. By offloading technical overhead, VASPilot enables researchers to focus on scientific discovery and accelerates high-throughput computational materials research.</description>

      <title>Electron Energy Loss Spectra Simulations of Coupled Phonon and Magnon Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectra (EELS) in body-centered cubic iron at 300 K, capturing the effects of coupled phonon and magnon excitations within a unified dynamical formalism. By extending the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunctions (TACAW) method to incorporate atomistic spin-lattice dynamics (ASLD), we simulate the full EELS signal - including interaction effects, dynamical diffraction, and multiple scattering. Our results reveal non-additive spectral features arising from phonon-magnon coupling, including interference and energy redistribution effects, and predict experimental detectability of magnon signals under optimized detector conditions.

      <title>A Novel Computational Thermodynamics Framework with Intrinsic Chemical Short-Range Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical short-range order (SRO) provides new opportunities for tuning alloy properties, but conventional computational thermodynamics frameworks such as CALPHAD, based on Bragg-Williams mean-field approximations, cannot properly describe SRO or order-disorder transformations in multicomponent ($\geq$3) alloys. First-principles approaches combined with the cluster variation method (CVM) or cluster expansion method (CEM) can capture SRO but suffer from high computational cost. Here we present a hybrid CVM-CALPHAD framework with a thermodynamic solid solution model named as FYL-CVM, enabled by the Fowler-Yang-Li (FYL) transform to reduce the number of variables required in free-energy minimization. This achieves efficient modeling of SRO in multicomponent systems within the CALPHAD formalism. Benchmark tests on fcc AB binaries show that FYL-CVM reproduces CVM phase diagrams with much higher efficiency, while non-configurational contributions from vibrational, elastic, and electronic terms are also incorporated to capture their physical effects on order-disorder boundaries. Applied to the Cu-Au system, this method produces phase diagrams with experimental data in an efficient parameterization and elucidates the temperature-composition dependence of SRO parameters via the SRO diagram. Its applicability to ternary alloys is also demonstrated for the Cu-Au-Ag system. Overall, this framework strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency, extends CALPHAD to account for chemical SRO, and enables a comprehensive physics-informed modeling of ordering phenomena.

      <title>Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility of high-throughput density-functional-theory calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While standard computational protocols for density functional theory (DFT) have universal applicability, differences exist in code implementations. Specific applications require manual parameter optimization, whereas high-throughput calculations employ predefined workflows. This paper uses the bandgap as a key property to reveal the impact of computational workflow differences on the reproducibility of high-throughput calculation results. The study proposes basic requirements for ensuring reproducibility: using structures optimised using the same procedure as used to calculate properties and ensuring Brillouin zone (k-point) integration grid accuracy. This research establishes a foundation for the reproducibility of DFT calculations and reliable application of results, which is of great significance for method development and artificial intelligence model training.</description>

      <title>On the N\'eel Vector Dependence of X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependence of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism on the experimental geometry is described by a frequency-dependent Hall vector. Using group theory, we derive a general relationship between the Hall vector and the orientation of the N\'eel vector $\bL$ in altermagnets within the free valence spin (FVS) approximation, where the spin-orbit coupling of the valence electrons and their exchange interaction with the core electrons are neglected. For a given spin point group, the full $\bL$-dependence of the Hall vector can be expressed in terms of several irreducible spectral functions. This derivation generalizes earlier results for the special cases of MnTe and MnF$_2$. Depending on the system symmetry, XMCD in the FVS approximation may be present, emerge only when the neglected terms are included, or be completely forbidden.</description>

      <title>Controlling Single-Pulse Magnetization Switching through Angular Momentum Reservoir Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a systematic study of single pulse all optical helicity independent switching in CoGd bilayers, revealing that the magnetization reversal dynamics can be tuned over more than three orders of magnitude. By varying the Gd thickness or inserting a Pt spacer layer between Co and Gd, we control the angular momentum transferred from the rare earth sublattice to the transition metal sublattice. Our results show that when Gd is abundant and strongly coupled to Co, angular momentum is efficiently transferred during Gd demagnetization, leading to ultrafast Co reversal. In contrast, reducing the Gd thickness or introducing a Pt barrier impedes this transfer, resulting in a domain growth mediated reversal on nanosecond and possibly to microsecond timescales as previously observed in CoDy and CoHo alloys. As a result, in rare earth transition metal systems, replacing Gd with heavier rare-earth elements such as Dy or Ho slows down the switching due to a reduced angular momentum transfer towards Co upon demagnetization as demonstrated in CoGdDy alloys. Our findings establish angular momentum availability and transfer pathways as key parameters governing AO HIS dynamics, offering a unified framework for fast and slow magnetization reversal across rare earth transition metal systems.</description>

      <title>Intercalation-Induced Near Room-Temperature Ferromagnetism in CrI3 via Synergistic Exchange Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of room-temperature magnetic semiconductors is critical for advancing spintronic technologies, yet van der Waals magnets like CrI3 exhibit intrinsically low Curie temperatures (Tc = 45 K). This study employs first-principles calculations to demonstrate that atom intercalation, particularly lithium (Li), dramatically enhances magnetic exchange couplings in CrI3, achieving near room-temperature ferromagnetism with a predicted Tc of 286 K-aligning with experimental reports of 420 K. The underlying mechanism involves synergistic superexchange and double-exchange interactions: intercalation reduces the |Ep-Ed| energy difference between iodine p-orbitals and chromium d-orbitals, strengthening superexchange pathways, while charge transfer induces valence mixing (e.g., Cr3+ to Cr2+, as confirmed by experimental X-ray photoelectron spectrometry data), promoting double-exchange. Theoretical predictions extend to other intercalants including Cu and Na, with Cu0.25CrI3 and Na0.25CrI3 exhibiting Tc of 267 K and 247 K, respectively, establishing a versatile strategy for designing high-Tc magnetic semiconductors. This work bridges theoretical insights with experimental validation, offering a transferable framework for intercalation-driven material design and accelerating practical spintronic device realization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear and nonlinear optical effect has been widely discussed in large quantity of materials using theoretical or experimental methods. Except linear optical conductivity, higher-order nonlinear responses are not studied fully. Starting from density operator method, we derive optical conductivities of different orders in Green's function formula, and also connect them to novel physical quantities, such as Berry curvature, Berry curvature dipole, third-order nonlinear Hall conductivity and so on. Based on the advantages of Green's function formulas, we believe that these formulas have a lot of benefits for many-body effect study in high-order nonlinear optical responses.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of the Topologically Nontrivial Phase in Monolayer Si$_2$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free-standing monolayer Si$_2$Te$_2$ (ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$) has been theoretically predicted to host a room-temperature quantum spin Hall phase. However, its experimental realization remains challenge due to the absence of a three-dimensional counterpart. Here, we demonstrate that HfTe$_2$ serves as an ideal substrate for the epitaxial growth of ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$, preserving its topological phase. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy confirm a strain-free ${(1 \times 1)}$ lattice of ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$, along with a sizable band gap, which is well captured by first-principles calculations. Moreover, distinct edge states, independent of step geometry and exhibiting a broad spatial distribution, are observed at ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$ step edges, underscoring its topological nature.</description>

      <title>Effective toughness estimation by FFT based phase field fracture: application to composites and polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An estimate of the effective toughness of heterogeneous materials is proposed based on the Phase Field Fracture model implemented in an FFT homogenization solver. The estimate is based on the simulation of the deformation of representative volume elements of the microstructure, controlled by a constant energy dissipation rate using an arc-length type control. The definition of the toughness corresponds to the total energy dissipated after the total fracture of the RVE -- which can be accurately obtained thanks to the dissipation control -- divided by the RVE transverse area (length in 2D). The proposed estimate accounts for both the effect of heterogeneity in toughness and elastic response on the overall fracture energy and allows as well to account for phases with anisotropic elastic and fracture response (fracture by cleavage). To improve toughness predictions, crack-tip enrichment is used to model initial cracks. The method is applied to obtain the effective toughness of composites and elastic polycrystals in a series of examples. In the two types of materials, it is found that both heterogeneity in elastic response and fracture energy contribute to increase the effective toughness. Microscopically, it is found that toughening mechanisms are related to the passage of the crack through tougher phases and deviation of the crack path. It is also found that the latter is the controlling mechanism for cases with marked heterogeneity and high anisotropy, eventually provoking toughening saturation for sufficiently high values of heterogeneity or anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Computational Demonstration of a Highly Stable, in-situ Pt Decorated Sputtered ZnO Hydrogen Sensor for sub-ppm Level Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a Pt decorated ZnO thin film-based gas sensor for hydrogen detection, fabricated using a sputtering technique and an in-situ Pt decoration approach. Specifically, we deposit a ZnO thin film on an interdigitated electrode substrate, with Pt nanoclusters added to the (002) polar plane by brief sputtering (1 to 6 s) to create an active sensing interface. Our sensor demonstrates optimal performance at an operating temperature of 498 K, with rapid response and recovery times (10 and 3 s), high selectivity, and long-term stability. We find the Pt decorated ZnO sensor, with a Pt deposition time of 2 s, to exhibit enhanced response (~52,987%) to 1% hydrogen concentration, indicating its suitability for industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Additionally, our device demonstrates reliable detection of low hydrogen concentrations (~100 ppb), with a response of ~38% and no response drift over one year of testing, underscoring the long-term stability of the sensor. To elucidate the role of Pt deposition and pristine ZnO in hydrogen sensing, we perform density functional theory calculations, analysing adsorption and reaction energetics involving H2, O2, O, OH, and H2O, and lattice oxygen atoms on the ZnO (002) surface with and without Pt decoration. Our computational data is in agreement with our experiments, identifying the oxygen-exposed (002) surface to be most active for hydrogen sensing in both pristine and Pt decorated ZnO. Further, our computations highlight the role of Pt in enhancing hydrogen sensitivity via i) activating an autoreduction pathway of adsorbed OH, ii) spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed molecular H2, and iii) keeping the lattice oxygen pathway of forming H2O active. Our systematic approach of designing sensors combining an experimental setup with theoretical insights, is key in developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen gas sensors.</description>

      <title>Spin Phonon Coupling and Relaxation time in Lu(II) compound with 9.2GHz clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spin qubits operating at atomic clock transitions exhibit exceptionally long coherence times, making them promising candidates for scalable quantum information applications. In solid-state systems, interactions between qubits and lattice phonons are known to play a critical role in spin relaxation (T1) and decoherence (T2). In this work, we perform first-principles calculations on a Lu(II) complex spin qubit featuring a prominent clock transition. By employing advanced electronic structure methods, we quantitatively evaluate the influence of phonons on the hyperfine interaction, which serves as the primary spin-lattice coupling mechanism. Treating these phonon-induced variations as first-order perturbations, we apply the Redfield master equation to compute both T1 and T2, along with their temperature dependencies. For T1, we adopt a second quantization formalism to describe phonon interactions, while T2 is evaluated by explicitly integrating acoustic phonon contributions across the full Brillouin zone. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of T2, including the coherence peak near 0.43 T, though the absolute values of T1 and T2 differ by one to two orders of magnitude. Analysis reveals that T1 is primarily governed by longitudinal phonons, whereas T2 is most strongly influenced by mid-wavelength, mid-energy acoustic modes. These findings provide a quantitative demonstration of the clock transition protective effect on spin qubit coherence and offer a transferable computational framework for evaluating spin-phonon interactions in other molecular spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Hydrazine-Free Precursor for Solution-Processed All-Inorganic Se and Se1-xTex Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selenium (Se) has reemerged as a promising absorber material for indoor and tandem photovoltaics (PVs), and its alloys with Te (Se1-xTex) offer a widely tunable bandgap. Solution processing of this materials system offers a route to low-cost fabrication. However, solution processing of Se has, thus far, only used hydrazine, which is an extremely hazardous solvent. In this work, we prepare and isolate propylammonium poly-Se and poly-Se-Te precursors from a safer thiol-amine solvent system. We formulate molecular inks by dissolving the precursor n,n-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a monoethanolamine (EA) additive and process high-quality Se and Se1-xTex films with bandgaps ranging from 1.20 eV to 1.86 eV. We fabricate PVs from these films using TiO2 and MoO3 charge transport layers (CTLs) to achieve power conversion efficiencies as high as 2.73% for Se and 2.33% for Se0.7Te0.3 under solar simulation. Se devices show excellent stability with no degradation after 1 month in air, enabled by the excellent stability of Se and the use of inorganic CTLs. This work represents an important step towards low-cost solution-phase processing of Se and Se1-xTex alloys for PVs and photodetectors with low toxicity and high bandgap tunability.</description>

      <title>Field-derivative torque induced magnetization reversal in ferrimagnetic Gd$_{3/2}$Yb$_{1/2}$BiFe$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of spin switching in ferrimagnets via the excitation of THz pulses holds promise for future-generation magnetic memory devices. Such spin switching can be accomplished by the Zeeman torque exerted by the THz pulses on the magnetic spins. Theoretical and experimental works have established that the field-derivative of a terahertz pulse also exerts a torque, field derivative torque (FDT). Here, we investigate the role of the FDT in the spin switching in ferrimagnetic Gd$_{3/2}$Yb$_{1/2}$BiFe$_5$O$_{12}$ using a computational approach. Our results foresee that the spin switching in the presence of the FDT requires less THz magnetic fields than the spin switching without the FDT. Without the FDT terms, the spin switching in the considered system requires an extremely high magnetic field. Furthermore, we compute the switching and non-switching contour diagrams to show that the FDT tremendously enhances the possibility of spin switching. These results not only shed light on the significance of the FDT in magnetization switching but also suggest materials where the switching effect is pronounced.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and Crystal Symmetry Effects on Spin Hall Conductivity in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, which reconcile zero net magnetization with pronounced spin splitting, offer fresh opportunities for spin-based functionalities in next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. In this paper, we explore the unconventional spin Hall conductivity (USHC) in three prototypical altermagnets -- RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe -- and elucidate how distinct magnetic and crystal symmetries modulate their spin Hall responses. RuO$_2$ exhibits only trivial USHC contributions under a tilted geometry, demonstrating that symmetry projections alone can induce apparent unconventional elements. In contrast, CrSb and MnTe manifest robust, symmetry-driven USHC without structural tilts, enabled by easy-axis orientations that reduce magnetic symmetry. Through extensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the complementary roles of the time-reversal-even and time-reversal-odd components in determining the overall SHC. Our findings indicate that controlling the interplay between crystal and magnetic symmetry -- for instance, by epitaxial strain or doping -- can provide an experimental avenue to tune USHC magnitudes and directions in altermagnets. These results pave the way for the engineering of multifunctional spintronic devices, where enhanced coherence and robust spin transport are realized in zero-net-moment materials with easily tailored spin configurations.</description>

      <title>Proximate spin-liquid behavior in the double trillium lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report proximate quantum spin liquid behavior in K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ with the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions embedded on a highly frustrated three-dimensional double trillium lattice. Single-crystal and high-resolution synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition at $T_{\rm t} \simeq 125$ K from high-temperature cubic to low-temperature monoclinic phase with the three-fold superstructure. Magnetization and heat capacity consistently show the formation of the $J_{\rm eff} =1/2$ state of Co$^{2+}$ below 50 K. In zero field, K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ shows signatures of static magnetic order formed below $T^* \simeq 0.6$ K, but muon spin relaxation experiments reveal a large fluctuating component that persists down to at least 50 mK, reminiscent of quantum spin liquid (QSL). Static order is completely suppressed in the small magnetic field of $\sim 1$ T, and low-temperature heat capacity demonstrates the $T^2$ behavior above this field, another fingerprint of QSL. Ab initio calculations show a competition of several antiferromagnetic couplings that render K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ a promising pseudospin-$\frac12$ material for studying quantum magnetism in the double trillium lattice geometry.</description>

      <title>Breakdown and polarization contrasts in ferroelectric devices observed by operando laser-based photoemission electron microscopy with the AC/DC electrical characterization system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an operando laser-based photoemission electron microscope (laser-PEEM) with a ferroelectric characterization system. A Sawyer-Tower circuit was implemented to measure the polarization-voltage ($P-V$) characteristics of ferroelectric devices. Using this system, we successfully obtained the well-defined $P-V$ hysteresis loops for a ferroelectric capacitor incorporating Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO), reproducing the typical field-cycling characteristics of HZO capacitors. After dielectric breakdown caused by field-cycling stress, we visualized a conduction filament through the top electrode without any destructive processing. Additionally, we successfully observed polarization contrast through the top electrode of an oxide semiconductor (InZnO$_x$). These results indicate that our operando laser-PEEM system is a powerful tool for visualizing conduction filaments after dielectric breakdown, the ferroelectric polarization contrasts, and electronic state distribution of materials implemented in ferroelectric devices, including ferroelectric field-effect transistors and ferroelectric tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ ($R$=rare earth, $T$=transition metal) magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RT\textsubscript{12} materials continue to attract attention due to their potential use as ``rare-earth-lean'' permanent magnets, but converting their promising intrinsic properties into practical high performance remains an elusive goal. Sophisticated experimental characterization techniques are providing unprecedented insight into the structure of these materials at the atomistic scale. Atomistic spin dynamics or micromagnetics simulations could help unravel the links between these structures and resultant magnet performance, but require input data describing the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory are used to determine these properties for two model interface structures which have been derived from recently reported high resolution electron microscopy images. One model structure is a stoichiometric twin formed by mirroring the RT\textsubscript{12} structure in the (101) plane, and the other model structure is a ``stacking fault'' involving the insertion of a RT\textsubscript{4} plane and a displacement along the [100] axis. Magnetic moments and crystal field coefficients have been calculated for the optimized structures. The interfaces modify the magnetic properties at the sub-nm scale. In particular, in the R-rich region of the ``stacking fault'', the local easy axis of magnetization rotates by $49^\circ$ from its bulk direction, which may lead to reduced coercivity through the easier nucleation of reverse domains.</description>

      <title>Generative Inversion for Property-Targeted Materials Design: Application to Shape Memory Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs. Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal hysteresis of 29 {\deg}C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ce Substitution on Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Ga Doped Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to replace conventional liquid electrolytes, solid electrolyte should possess high ionic conductivity. In this study, the effects of Ga-Ce co-doping on the garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte have been investigated. The series Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2-xCexO12 has been prepared with varying content of Ce from 0 to 0.30 atoms per formula unit (a.p.f.u.) by sintering at 1050^0C. Various structural characterizations namely X-diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), density measurements were carried out. The electrochemical analysis suggested that, the sample with 0.10 a.p.f.u. of Ce offered the highest room temperature ionic conductivity of 4 x 10-4 S/cm with the minimum activation energy of 0.29 eV. Moreover, DC conductivity measurement proved the predominant ionic conduction in the prepared samples making it suitable for the application in all solid state Li-ion batteries (ASSLIBs).</description>

      <title>Multiple Adsorption of CO Molecules on Transition Metal Substitutional Impurities in Copper Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper-based catalysts are of particular interest for electrochemical reduction of CO$_2$ (CO2RR) as products beyond CO can form. To improve activity and selectivity, several studies have focused on the addition of other elements as substitutional impurities. Although the adsorption of a single CO molecule has often been used as a descriptor for CO2RR activity, our recent calculations using the RPBE functional showed that multiple CO molecules can bind to first-row transition metal impurities. Here, we extend the study to second-row transition metals and also to a functional that explicitly includes dispersion interaction, BEEF-vdW. The binding energy of the first CO molecule on the impurity atom is found to be significantly larger than on the clean Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces, but the differential binding energy generally drops as more CO molecules adsorb. The dispersion interaction is found to make a significant contribution to the binding energy, in particular for the last and weakest bound CO molecule, the one that is most likely to participate in CO2RR. In some cases, four CO admolecules can bind more strongly on the impurity atom than on the clean copper surface. The adsorption of CO causes the position of the impurity atom to shift outwards and in some cases, even escape from the surface layer. The C-O stretch frequencies are calculated in order to identify possible experimental signatures of multiple CO adsorption.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the depth-dependent nitrogen-vacancy center quantum sensor in diamane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is the representative solid state defect qubit for quantum information science, offering long coherence time at room temperature. To achieve high sensitivity and spatial resolution, shallow NV center near the surface are preferred. However, shallow NV center suffers from surface states and spin noise which reduce the photostability and coherence time. In this work, we systematically study the NV center in recently reported two-dimensional diamond, known as diamane--using first-principles calculations. We show that the quantum confinement in finite-layer diamane, with appropriate surface passivation, could significantly modify the band structure. In particular, we identify oxygen surface termination capable of hosting NV center in diamane while optimizing photostability compared to bulk diamond. Furthermore, layer-dependent NV center demonstrates tunable zero-phonon-line and suppressed phonon side band, while retaining long coherence time. Our findings highlight diamane as a promising platform for NV-based quantum information processing with improved optical properties and stability</description>

      <title>Cr resonant impurity for studies of band inversion and band offsets in IV-VI semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the electronic structure of transition-metal dopants in IV-VI semiconductors is critical for tuning their band structure. We analyze properties of Cr dopant in $Pb_{1-x}Sn_xTe$ and PbSe by magnetic and transport measurements, which are interpreted based on density functional calculations. We demonstrate that the pinning of the Fermi energy to the chromium resonant level occurs for both n-type and p-type $Pb_{1-x}Sn_xTe$ in the whole composition range. This enables us to determine the valence band and conduction band offsets at the PbTe/SnTe/PbSe heterointerfaces, which is important for designing high-prformance 2D transistors. Furthermore, the magnetic measurements reveal the presence of Cr ions in three charge states, $Cr^{3+}$, $Cr^{2+}$, and $Cr^{1+}$. The last one corresponds to the Cr dopants incorporated at the interstitial, and not the substitutional, sites. The measured concentrations of the interstitial and substitutional Cr are comparable.</description>

      <title>Sliding Ferroelectric Metal with Ferrimagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectric (FE) metals with ferrimagnetism represent a previously unexplored class of spintronic materials, where the interplay of ferroelectricity, metallicity, and magnetism enables strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling and electrically tunable spintronic functionalities. Here, based on antiferromagnetic (AFM) metallic bilayers, we propose a general strategy for constructing 2D sliding FE ferrimagnetic (FiM) metals that can achieve tri-state switching, in which the FE polarization, spin splitting, and net magnetization are reversed simultaneously through FE switching. As a prototypical realization, we design a bilayer sliding FE metal with FiM order, derived from monolayer Fe5GeTe2-a van der Waals metal with intrinsic magnetic order close to room temperature. The system exhibits a FE transition from a nonpolar (NP) AFM phase to a FE FiM phase via interlayer sliding. The in-plane mirror symmetry breaking in FE metallic states lift the spin degeneracy that exists in the NP phase, leading to a sizable net magnetic moment and strong linear ME coupling. The interplay between metallicity and FE FiM gives rise to pronounced sign-reversible transport responses near the Fermi level, all of which can be fully electrically controlled by FE switching without reorienting the N\'{e}el order. Our results establish sliding FE metals with FiM as a promising platform for electrically reconfigurable, high-speed, and low-dissipation spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin nanowires could play a central role in next-generation downscaled electronics. Here, we explore some of the most promising candidates identified from previous high-throughput screening: CuC$_2$, TaSe$_3$, and AuSe$_2$, to gain insight into the thermodynamic and anharmonic behaviors of nanowires that could be exfoliated from weakly-bonded three-dimensional materials. We analyze thermal stability, linear thermal expansion, and anharmonic heat capacity using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Notably, our work unveils exotic features common among all the 1D wires: a colossal record negative thermal expansion and very large deviations from the Dulong-Petit law due to strong anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Cu2OSeO3 Turns Trigonal with Structural Transformation and Implications for Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and characteristics of magnetic skyrmions are strongly governed by the symmetry of the underlying crystal structure. In this study, we report the discovery of a new trigonal polymorph of Cu2OSeO3, observed exclusively in nanoparticles. Electron diffraction and density functional theory calculations confirm its R3m space group, sharing C3v symmetry with N\'eel-type skyrmion hosts. This polymorph is likely stabilized by surface effects, suggesting that size-induced structural changes may drive a transformation from Bloch-type to Neel-type skyrmions in Cu2OSeO3. This hypothesis is consistent with prior unexplained observations of Neel-type skyrmions at the surfaces of bulk crystals, which may result from surface-specific structural distortions. Overall, these findings provide insights into the interplay between size, structure, and magnetism, opening pathways for controlling skyrmionic properties in nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Order and Li$_x$TM$_{4-x}$ Probability Maps for Disordered Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range order (SRO) in the cation-disordered state is a controlling factor influencing the probability of finding Li$_{4}$ tetrahedron clusters in disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. However, the prevalent Li$_4$ probability below the random limit across reported DRX compositions has not been systematically investigated, active strategies to surpass the random limit of Li$_4$ probability are lacking, and the fundamental ordering behavior on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice remains insufficiently explored. This research quantitatively examines pair SRO parameters and Li$_x$TM$_{4-x}$ probabilities via exhaustive Monte Carlo mapping across a simplified subset of the parameter space. The results indicate that, in the disordered state, the Li$_4$ probability is governed by the nearest neighbor (NN) pair-wise SRO parameter, and that these quantities do not necessarily represent a simple attenuation of their corresponding low-temperature long-range order, particularly for the important cases of Layered and Spinel-like orderings. Strategies are proposed to mitigate or even reverse the lithium and transition metals mixing tendency of NN pair SRO to achieve Li$_4$ probabilities that exceed the random limit. This study advances the fundamental thermodynamic understanding of ordering behaviors, which can be generalized to any FCC system.</description>

      <title>Selectively embedding multiple spatially steered fibers in polymer composite parts made using vat photopolymerization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composite (FRPC) parts are mostly made as laminates, shells, or surfaces wound with 2D fiber patterns even after the emergence of additive manufacturing. Making FRPC parts with embedded continuous fibers in 3D is not reported previously even though topology optimization shows that such designs are optimal. Earlier attempts in 3D fiber reinforcement have demonstrated additively manufactured parts with channels into which fibers are inserted. In this paper, we present 3D printing techniques along with a printer developed for printing parts with continuous fibers that are spatially embedded inside the matrix using a variant of vat photopolymerization. Multiple continuous fibers are gradually steered as the part is built layer upon layer instead of placing them inside channels made in the part. We show examples of spatial fiber patterns and geometries built using the 3D printing techniques developed in this work. We also test the parts for strength and illustrate the importance of spatially embedding fibers in specific patterns.</description>

      <title>High-density and scalable graphene Hall sensor arrays through monolithic CMOS integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials (2DMs) significantly outperform their silicon counterparts; however, silicon CMOS technology remains commercially predominant as it offers the capability to operate dense arrays of devices in a scalable fashion. In particular, graphene Hall sensors (GHSs) offer great improvements in magnetic field sensitivity and resolution compared to silicon Hall-effect sensors, making them extremely appealing for magnetic field imaging and biosensing. At present, GHS arrays have limited scalability compared to silicon CMOS since they require planar routing for biasing and multiplexing. In this work, we explore strategies to realize high-density graphene Hall sensor arrays by vertically connecting GHSs with silicon CMOS biasing and multiplexing circuitry, allowing the routing and circuitry to scale with the array. We investigate the importance of design choices in the chip layout and post-fabrication process in maximizing the reliability of graphene transfer onto mm-scale CMOS dies. Our experimental results validate the success of the integration process by showing for the first time that GHSs can be monolithically integrated with CMOS with high yield to form sensor arrays. We expect that these results will lead to further improvements in magnetic sensing technology and broader advancements in large-scale heterogeneous 2DM-CMOS systems.</description>

      <title>Fracture toughness and auxeticity in disordered metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auxetic metamaterials are commonly thought to exhibit favorable mechanical properties, notably high energy absorption. Here we investigate disordered metamaterials obtained from random beam networks by optimizing simultaneously auxeticity and the energy absorbed before fracture. By giving different weights to these optimization targets, we demonstrate that the optimal configurations are connected along a Pareto front where high auxeticity implies comparatively low energy absorption and vice versa. We study the mechanical properties of the resulting metamaterials and characterize the different deformation modes obtained for distinct optimization targets. The simulation and optimization results are validated by comparison with the deformation behavior of additively manufactured samples. Our work provides an illustration of the potentials and limitations of multi-objective optimization in the design of disordered mechanical metamaterials</description>

      <title>Multiscale Microscopy via Automation: Dual Magnification ESEM Imaging by Frame Alternation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) experiments, the acquisition parameters are generally kept constant throughout the collection of a data set. This limits data collection to one data set at a time, and frequent human interaction is required to maintain the image quality. Here, we use a custom-designed automation interface to minimize such supervision and allow for the collection of multiple interlaced data sets simultaneously. The oscillatory modes of an example catalytic system (hydrogen oxidation over Co foil) were employed as a tunable spatiotemporal test case. Using our automation interface, we can implement more advanced acquisition programs into the microscope that allow dual imaging - effectively bridging reaction monitoring between different length scales. By using automation to change the settings of the acquisition after each frame, we are able to capture alternating magnifications of the same process and sample location. Both a low magnification overview of the mesoscopic surface dynamics and a high magnification field of view of the ongoing structural changes of a selected surface motif were acquired. Using such truly correlative data captured with the dual magnification method, cross-scale correlations about catalytic systems including phase information can be established.</description>

      <title>Imaging 3D Printed Fracture Networks under Stress using X-Ray Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental approach based on 3D printing and X-ray computed tomography to characterize fracture aperture distribution and evolution in 3D fracture networks under varying stress loading conditions. We validate our methodology by comparing experimentally measured stress-dependent fracture apertures with both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, for both single fracture and fracture network scenarios. We show that, for fracture deformation under linear elastic regime, our experimental results agree with numerical simulation. Furthermore, by combining our new experimental methodology with advanced numerical simulations, we illuminate the complex interplay of stress and topology in fracture network deformation. Our approach opens the door for experimentally observing deformable fracture networks under stress in 3D space, which has significant implications for understanding and predicting many geophysical problems involving fractured geological media.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing Serendipity: Multi-Agent AI Workflows for Enhanced Materials Characterization with Theory-in-the-Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial, unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source, multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments. By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence Extracts Structure-Function Relationships from Plants for New Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>TorchSim: An efficient atomistic simulation engine in PyTorch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TorchSim, an open-source atomistic simulation engine tailored for the Machine Learned Interatomic Potential (MLIP) era. By rewriting core atomistic simulation primitives in PyTorch, TorchSim can achieve orders of magnitude acceleration for popular MLIPs. Unlike existing molecular dynamics packages, which simulate one system at a time, TorchSim performs batched simulations that efficiently utilize modern GPUs by evolving multiple systems concurrently. TorchSim supports molecular dynamics integrators, structural relaxation optimizers, both machine-learned and classical interatomic potentials (such as Lennard-Jones, Morse, soft-sphere), batching with automatic memory management, differentiable simulation, and integration with popular materials informatics tools.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Self-Driving Labs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key goal of modern materials science is accelerating the pace of materials discovery. Self-driving labs, or systems that select experiments using machine learning and then execute them using automation, are designed to fulfil this promise by performing experiments faster, more intelligently, more reliably, and with richer metadata than conventional means. This review summarizes progress in understanding the degree to which SDLs accelerate learning by quantifying how much they reduce the number of experiments required for a given goal. The review begins by summarizing the theory underlying two key metrics, namely acceleration factor AF and enhancement factor EF, which quantify how much faster and better an algorithm is relative to a reference strategy. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, which reveals a wide range of AFs with a median of 6, and that tends to increase with the dimensionality of the space, reflecting an interesting blessing of dimensionality. In contrast, reported EF values vary by over two orders of magnitude, although they consistently peak at 10-20 experiments per dimension. To understand these results, we perform a series of simulated Bayesian optimization campaigns that reveal how EF depends upon the statistical properties of the parameter space while AF depends on its complexity. Collectively, these results reinforce the motivation for using SDLs by revealing their value across a wide range of material parameter spaces and provide a common language for quantifying and understanding this acceleration.</description>

      <title>Radiative Heat Transfer and 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Engineering snags for spatial curvature in weaves: Fabrication, mechanics, and inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weaving as an old craft has extensive applications in modern science and technology such as smart textiles and intelligent soft robots. However, weaving irregular curved surfaces has been difficult, with prior alternatives requiring curved ribbons and triaxial weaving patterns. In this work, we present a simple strategy to achieve complex spatial curvature by purposely introducing 'snags', a traditionally unwanted textile defect, into dense plain weaves consisting of straight ribbons assembled in a straightforward biaxial network. We detail the fabrication methodology where we pull out ribbons of initially smooth two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) plain weaves to form local snags. We show that these local defects cause global curvatures through the propagation of geometric frustration. We then use a reduced-order bar &amp; hinge model to simulate the mechanics-guided deformation of snagged plain weaves, and we investigate how the curvature scales with system parameters such as the thickness and Young's modulus of the ribbons. Finally, we introduce an inverse design platform where an evolutionary algorithm is used to inversely compute the optimal snag patterns of smooth plain weaves to approximate arbitrary target surfaces including 2D and 3D woven exoskeletons that fit human legs and elbows, respectively. Engineering snags in plain weaves as a general strategy can pave the way for future design of customizable wearable devices, adaptive soft robots, reconfigurable architecture, and more.</description>

      <title>Incommensuration in odd-parity antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnets (AFMs) with odd-parity spin-polarization pattern have been proposed as a new venue for spintronics. These AFMs require commensurate ordering to ensure an effective time-reversal symmetry, which guarantees a strictly antisymmetric spin polarization of the electronic states. Recently, nonsymmorphic centrosymmetric crystals have been identified as a broad class of materials which could exhibit unit-cell doubling magnetism with odd-parity spin-polarization. Here we investigate the stability of these states against incommensuration. We first demonstrate that the symmetry conditions which permit a p-wave spin polarization pattern also permit the existence of a non-relativistic Lifshitz invariant in the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau free energy. This implies magnetism with an incommensurate ordering vector, independent of its microscopic origin. AFMs with f- or h-wave spin-polarization are also prone to incommensurability, especially when they have an itinerant origin. Here the symmetry which ensures the odd-parity spin-polarization also guarantees the existence of van Hove saddle points off the time-reversal-invariant momenta, which promote incommensurate spin fluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional electronic systems. Finally, we study the effect of weak spin-orbit coupling in locally noncentrosymmetric materials and find that it favors antiferromagnetic phases with in-plane magnetic moments. However, the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling also introduces a new mechanism for driving incommensuration. Our results imply that odd-parity AFMs are likely to be preceded by an incommensurate phase, or emerge directly from the normal state via a first order transition. These conclusions are consistent with the phase diagram of several candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological phases, which go beyond traditional Abelian topological band theory, are garnering increasing attention. This is further spurred by periodic driving, leading to predictions of many novel multi-gap Floquet topological phases, including anomalous Euler and Dirac string phases induced by non-Abelian Floquet braiding, as well as Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNTIs) that exhibit multifold bulk-edge correspondence. Here, we report the first experimental realization of anomalous FNTIs, which demonstrate topological edge modes in all three gaps despite having a trivial bulk charge. Concretely, we construct an experimentally feasible one-dimensional three-band Floquet model and implement it in acoustics by integrating time-periodic coupling circuits to static acoustic crystals. Furthermore, we observe counterintuitive topological interface modes in the domain-wall formed by an anomalous FNTI and its counterpart with swapped driving sequences, modes previously inaccessible in Floquet Abelian systems. Our work paves the way for further experimental exploration of the uncharted non-equilibrium topological physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a systematic study of the electronic structures, band topology, and intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) of the layered MAX carbides Mn+1AlCn (M= Nb, Ta, n=1, 2, 3) and explore the correlation effects on the SHE. The results show that M3AlC2 and M4AlC3 (M= Nb, Ta) share similar Dirac-band-crossing features near the Fermi level (EF) and form nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). When the SOC is included, the Dirac band crossings are fully gapped, resulting in nontrivial Z2 topological invariants (1;000) with a pair of surface states on the (001) plane. Remarkably, the multiple gapped Dirac points contribute to locally strong spin Berry curvatures, which lead to large spin Hall conductivities and a giant spin Hall angle up to ~ 60% for Ta3AlC2. Moreover, we also elucidate the impact of Hubbard U correction on SHC. Our findings indicate that Ta3AlC2 might represent an intriguing layered Z2 topological metal with superior charge-to-spin conversion efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Spin currents can carry either spin angular momentum or its associated magnetic moment, which are no longer strictly proportional in multiband systems. Using a multiband $k \cdot p$ model, we compute the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity tensors of elemental Bi. The magnetic-moment tensor emerges about two orders of magnitude larger and far less anisotropic than the angular-momentum tensor, while quasiparticle damping activates otherwise longitudinal components. The magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeds unity, demonstrating that a clear distinction between the two currents is indispensable for multiband systems.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Induced Quantum Metric Dipole in Dirac Semimetal Cd3As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometry, comprising Berry curvature and quantum metric, plays a fundamental role in governing electron transport phenomena in solids. Recent studies show that the quantum metric dipole drives scattering-free nonlinear Hall effect in topological antiferromagnets, prompting the questions of whether this effect can occur in nonmagnetic systems and be externally tuned by a magnetic field. Our work addresses these frontiers by demonstrating that the quantum metric dipole is actively tuned by an external magnetic field to generate a time-reversal-odd nonlinear Hall response in a nonmagnetic topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Alongside the well-known chiral-anomaly-induced negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, an exotic nonlinear planar Hall effect emerges with increasing magnetic field. Careful scaling analysis indicates that this nonlinear planar Hall effect is controlled by the magnetic-field-modulated quantum metric dipole. Constructing a k.p effective model of the Dirac bands under Zeeman and orbital coupling, we derive the evolution of the quantum metric dipole as a function of the magnetic field, providing a comprehensive explanation of the experimental results. Our results establish a band-structure-based strategy for engineering nonlinear magnetotransport in nonmagnetic materials via the quantum metric dipole, opening a pathway toward magnetic-field-tunable nonlinear quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Insulator-bad metal transition in RNiO$_3$ nickelates beyond Hubbard model and density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The insulator-bad metal transition observed in the Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth or yttrium Y) is considered to be a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of the Hubbard $U$-$t$-model and the density functional theory. However, actually the real insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet (S=1) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless (S=0) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. Taking account of only charge degree of freedom we develop a novel minimal $U$-$V$-$t_b$-model for nickelates making use of the charge triplet model with the pseudospin formalism and effective field approximation. We show the existence of two types of CD-phases, high-temperature classical CO-phase with the G-type charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and low-temperature quantum CDq-phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, uncertain valence and spin value for NiO$_6$ centers. Model $T$-R phase diagram reproduces main features of the phase diagram found for RNiO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structure of a nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LnSbTe family is well known for hosting a plethora of intriguing characteristics stemming from its crystalline symmetry, magnetic structure, 4f electronic correlations and spin orbit coupling (SOC) phenomena. In this paper, we have systematically studied the bulk electrical and thermodynamic properties and electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) corroborated with first principles based theoretical band structure calculations with and without considering the effect of SOC, a critical factor dictating the band degeneracy which depends on the choice of the Ln atom. Corroborative temperature dependent susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements, coherently exhibit paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition approximately at 1.94 K, and another sharp anomaly at 1.75 K. The zero field cooled resistivity measurement does not show the characteristic hump like feature in the other LnSbTe materials. The electronic band structure of ErSbTe, exhibits a diamond shaped Fermi surface. Along the high symmetry direction GX, electronic bands are projected to cross over the Fermi energy, necessitated by the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the system. The other crossing along this direction is gapped, which evolves along the momentum space reaching its maximum along the GM direction.</description>

      <title>Correlated electrons in flat bands: Concepts and Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy, quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries. Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>A Method for Constructing Quasi-Random Peaked Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algorithm is proposed for constructing quasi-random "peaked" quantum circuits, i.e., circuits whose final qubit state exhibits a high probability concentration on a specific computational basis state. These circuits consist of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for deeper ones.</description>

      <title>Tunable Interfacial Thermal Conductance in Graphene/Germanene van der Waals Heterostructure using an Optimized Interlayer Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling interfacial thermal transport in van der Waals heterostructures is challenging due to the limited availability of interlayer interaction potentials. We develop a pairwise interlayer potential for graphene/germanene van der Waals heterostructure using the binding energy obtained from ab-initio density functional theory calculations and use it to calculate the interfacial thermal conductivity. Our calculations reveal that the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance to $\sim$136% of the unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite effect, reducing the conductance to $\sim$70% of the unstrained value. Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the interfacial thermal conductance for both directions of heat flow.</description>

      <title>Material Fingerprinting: A shortcut to material model discovery without solving optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.</description>

      <title>Gradient Electronic Landscapes in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices, heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching, which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes, limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol of low-temperature, strain-tuned re-entrant metal-insulator transition and crossover between strongly correlated line-graph lattices (Lieb and Kagome). Using a non-perturbative numerical approach, we demonstrate for the first time that an applied shear strain stabilizes a metallic phase cradled in between a gapped magnetic insulator and a gapless flat band localized insulator, facilitating the Lieb/Kagome interconversion. Our results on transport signatures exhibit variable scaling exponents for electrical resistivity and optical conductivity, providing clear evidence of non-Fermi liquid physics. We also define a strain-dependent thermal scale to quantify the crossover between the non-Fermi liquid and bad metal phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of spin-based devices as a replacement for CMOS technology demands lower spin-switching energy in ferromagnetic (FM) materials. Ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a promising avenue for influencing FM properties, yet the mechanisms driving this interplay remain inadequately understood. In this study, we investigate iron-adsorbed FE ABO$_3$ perovskites using a combination of first-principles calculations and machine learning. Our findings reveal a universal correlation between the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of iron and the induced magnetic dipole moments within the BO$_2$ layer and basal oxygen atoms of ABO$_3$ at the FE/FM interface. By identifying key material descriptors and achieving high predictive accuracy, this research provides a robust framework for selecting and optimizing ABO$_3$ substrates for energy-efficient spintronic devices. These insights contribute to the rational design of novel low-power spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>A15 Phase Ta3Sb Thin Films: Direct Synthesis, Charge Transport and Spin-Orbit Torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ta3Sb is one of the A15 compounds that have been predicted to have giant spin Hall conductivities due to the gapped Dirac-like band crossings in their electronic structures. We use co-sputtering to directly synthesize thin films of Ta3Sb and identify a large window of Ta:Sb flux ratio that permits the formation of single-phase A15 structure. These sputtered films have an actual Ta:Sb atomic ratio of 4:1 as determined from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Their high resistivity, at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, suggests that the electron mean free path is comparable to interatomic distances. From harmonic Hall and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity of thin film Ta3Sb is estimated to be in the range of -526 to -1230 (hbar/e) S/cm at 300 K, lower in magnitude than the predicted value of -1400 (hbar/e) S/cm. First-principles calculations of the electronic structure show that the discrepancy is consistent with an increase of the Fermi level due to the non-ideal stoichiometry needed to stabilize the A15 structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Advantage of the Correlated Exciton State in Non-linear Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of quantum geometry for single-particle states has revolutionized our interpretation of several emergent properties in condensed matter. However, a description of the quantum geometry for interacting particles and an understanding of its implications are lacking. Here, we show that inherent in the non-linear optical response is a quantum geometry of the correlated electron-hole state (exciton) that arises from the interplay between geometry and interactions - distinct from the quantum geometric properties of the individual electron or hole states. We demonstrate using first principles calculations that this quantum many-body geometry significantly enhances the non-linear optical response in systems with strong excitonic effects. In the case of shift currents, the quantum many-body geometric term arises in the many-body shift vector and can be interpreted as a many-body analogue of the Berry phase. This work lays the foundation to study the quantum geometry of correlated states in experimentally observable settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce "stochastic cloaking," where a region of space is concealed from an ensemble of diffusing particles whose individual trajectories are governed by a stochastic (Langevin) equation. Our simulations reveal how different interpretations of the Langevin equation affect the cloaking performance of an annular single-layer invisibility cloak of smoothly varying diffusivity in two dimensions. Near-perfect cloaking is achieved under the Ito convention, indicated by the cloak preventing particles from accessing an inner core without disturbing the particle density outside the cloak. The cloak's performance can be further improved by regularising its singular behaviour. We believe our demonstration of stochastic cloaking is a significant milestone, comparable to earlier developments that extended cloaking from optics and acoustics to thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing defect states in $(Bi_{0.3}Sb_{0.7})_{2}Te_{3}$ ternary topological insulators using indium doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of indium doping on the defect states in (Bi0.3Sb0.7)2Te3 (BST) ternary topological insulators. Thin (10 nm) and thick (60 nm) films of pristine BST and indium-doped BST (In0.14(Bi0.3Sb0.7)1.86Te3) were synthesized using pulsed laser deposition. The electronic properties were characterized through low-frequency noise spectroscopy and temperature-dependent resistance (R-T) measurements. For the 10 nm films, R-T analysis revealed that indium doping shifts the thermal activation energy by approximately 100 meV. This doping also suppresses a shallow impurity band at 72 meV, a finding corroborated by 1/f noise measurements. In the 60 nm films, noise spectroscopy was used to probe deep defect states, where indium doping was found to increase the activation energy from 292.3 meV to 392 meV -- a consistent shift of 100 meV. These findings demonstrate that indium doping is an effective method for systematically modifying both shallow and deep defect states, enhancing the insulating properties and offering a mechanism to engineer the electronic behavior of topological insulators for advanced electronic applications where noise reduction is crucial.</description>

      <title>Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling</title>

Abstract: The topological Hall effect is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work opens up the scope to go beyond the existing avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Controlled Anion Conversion into Dense Polycrystalline and Single-Crystalline Oxyhydrides</title>

Abstract: Oxyhydrides represent a new class of functional materials, yet the synthesis of dense polycrystals or single-crystals suitable for transport studies remains a significant challenge due to hydrogen desorption at elevated temperatures. The co-diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen in densely sintered BaTiO3 enables the topochemical formation of millimeter-scale bulk BaTiO3-xHx via high-pressure diffusion control (HPDC). Hydride ions selectively occupy oxygen-deficient sites, as confirmed by neutron diffraction, TPD, TG, and NMR. Systematic tuning of the hydrogen content and precise control of the electronic conductivity were achieved via HPDC. Hydrogen desorption analysis reveals distinct bonding states between near-surface and interior-bulk regions, which significantly affect the oxynitride conversion under N2 flow. Importantly, the diffusion-based nature of HPDC allows direct anion conversion even in single-crystalline oxides, as demonstrated by the synthesis of SrTiO3-xHx single crystals. These results establish HPDC as a general platform for accessing dense, metastable oxyhydrides with tunable anionic composition and transport properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics simulations of microstructure influence on hysteresis and eddy current losses of electrical steel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving efficiency of electrical machines requires fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms behind magnetic and eddy current losses of the magnetic core materials, with Fe-Si alloy as a prototype. These losses are intrinsically influenced by the microstructure of the materials. This necessitates physics-based, microstructure-informed multiscale simulations. In the present paper, we utilised micromagnetic simulations and computational homogenization methods to calculate the effective hysteresis and effective conductivities of Fe-Si electrical steels. To demonstrate the methodology, binder-jet printed electrical steel material samples with different microstructure were investigated. The microstructure samples were digitized based on both the descriptor-based synthetic reconstruction and SEM-image-based digitization. More samples were generated with varying microstructure features such as grain size and grain boundary phases. The micromagnetic simulations were then performed to investigate the magnetic hysteresis and hysteresis loss. The eddy current loss was also evaluated by using the effective conductivity through computational homogenization. By performing parameter research on a series of synthetic microstructures, effects of average grain size and grain boundary (GB) phase thickness on the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss were unveiled. An average grain size around 120 \si{\micro m} has the lowest hysteresis loss, although the eddy current loss increases with the grain size. Increasing GB-phase thickness helps reduce both losses. Results indicate the potential to decrease loss of magnetic core materials by microstructure optimization.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure fingerprints of visible-range excitons in $d^0$ double perovskite oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presence of excitons significantly influence the optoelectronic properties and potential applications of materials. Using combined theoretical and experimental tools, we investigate the absorption spectra of $d^0$ double perovskite oxides Ba$_{2}$Y$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Nb, Ta, Sb), Ba$_{2}$Sc$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Ta, Sb) and $A_{2}$ScSbO$_6$ ($A$=Ca, Sr, Ba), allowing for a systematic variation of composition. We not only show that low-energy excitons possessing large binding energies up to 3 eV are present in the visible range in all the considered wide-gap insulators, but also that the nature and properties of these excitons differs from those in double perovskite halides as well as perovskite oxides. We provide insights on the origin of such differences by a comparative analysis of the electronic structure. Our findings elucidate possible correlations between the exciton properties and the composition, via the electronic structure, towards a comprehensive understanding of correlation effects and rational design principles.</description>

      <title>PFD: Automatically Generating Machine Learning Force Fields from Universal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD, which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</description>

      <title>Tensor Learning and Compression of N-phonon Interactions</title>

Abstract: Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with &gt;98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn and monoclinic ZrO$_2$). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>Atomic Altermagnetism</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a N\'eel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear N\'eel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42{\deg} and 26{\deg} respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered N\'eel order of local dipole moments.</description>

Abstract: Atomic-resolution imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the nanoscale structure of materials, in particular features such as defects, local strains, and symmetry-breaking distortions. In addition to advanced instrumentation, the effectiveness of the technique depends on computational image analysis to extract meaningful features from complex datasets recorded in experiments, which can be complicated by the presence of noise and artifacts, small or overlapping features, and the need to scale analysis over large representative areas. Here, we present image analysis approaches which synergize real and reciprocal space information to efficiently and reliably obtain meaningful structural information with picometer scale precision across hundreds of nanometers of material from atomic-resolution electron microscope images. Damping superstructure peaks in reciprocal space allows symmetry-breaking structural distortions to be disentangled from other sources of inhomogeneity and measured with high precision. Real space fitting of the wave-like signals resulting from Fourier filtering enables absolute quantification of lattice parameter variations and strain, as well as the uncertainty associated with these measurements. Implementations of these algorithms are made available as an open source Python package.</description>

Abstract: Fundamentally understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport behavior in liquid-like, partially occupied compounds remains a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying the ultralow thermal conductivity in ordered/liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ by combining experimental methods with first-principles calculations. We first experimentally synthesize and characterize the ordered structure and liquid-like, partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with increasing temperature. We then combine self-consistent phonon calculations, including bubble-diagram corrections, with the Wigner transport equation, considering both phonon propagation and diffuson contributions, to evaluate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity in phase-change Cu$_3$BiS$_3$. Our theoretical model predicts an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.34 W/m/K at 400 K, dominated by diffuson contributions, which accurately reproduces and explains the experimental data. Importantly, the machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations not only reproduced the partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with the space group $\mathrm{P2_12_12_1}$ but also successfully replicated the thermal conductivity obtained from experiments and Wigner transport calculations. This observation highlights the negligible impact of ionic mobility arising from partially occupied Cu sites on the thermal conductivity in diffuson-dominated thermal transport compounds. Our work not only sheds light on the minimal impact of ionic mobility on ultralow thermal conductivity in phase-change materials but also demonstrates that the Wigner transport equation accurately describes thermal transport behavior in partially occupied phases with diffuson-dominant thermal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets offer much promise for antiferromagnetic spintronics and neuromorphic applications with a plethora of functional properties surpassing many competing magnetic systems. Films grown on mismatched substrates may relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects that strongly manipulate global physical properties important for application. This work demonstrates that a post growth annealing strategy results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that reveal the underlying thermal evolution of the magnetic order symmetry. Beyond a critical film thickness, the spin structure transitions between two right-handed irreducible chiral representations via left-handed chiral ordering producing a striking change in the sign and angular dependence of the Anomalous Hall coefficient. The previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane cannot fully explain the transition in applied magnetic field, and using a macrospin model this work finds that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction are energetically preferable under certain conditions. These observations suggest that both left-handed and right-handed chiral order can be accessed in a single system, opening new routes to engineer devices by controlled switching of magnetic chirality allowing selection of associated functional properties as governed by symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as promising materials for spintronic applications due to their unique magnetic properties and tunability. Controlling ferromagnetism via external stimuli is critical for both fundamental research and device integration. In particular, modulation of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions through strain offers a viable pathway for functional control. Owing to their weak interlayer coupling, vdW ferromagnets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to strain, enabling effective tuning of their magnetic states. In this study, electric-field-induced magnetoelectric coupling is investigated in the above-room-temperature vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ integrated on a ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. It is demonstrated that application of an electric field leads to a substantial reduction in coercive force along with dynamic reconfiguration of the magnetic domain structure. These effects are attributed to electric-field-induced modulation of the vdW interlayer gap and enhancement of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings reveal a strong interplay between electric fields and magnetism in vdW systems, offering a viable route toward the development of low-power, multifunctional magnetic devices. This work establishes a foundation for the electric-field control of magnetic properties in vdW ferromagnets and highlights their potential in next-generation spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Large strain contribution to the laser-driven magnetization response of magnetostrictive TbFe$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate strain-induced contributions to the transient polar magneto-optical Kerr effect response in laser-excited terfenol. The tr-MOKE signals obtained from TbFe$_{2}$ films with and without glass capping exhibit distinct signatures associated with transient strain. We experimentally observe the arrival of strain pulses via the reflectivity change. The tr-MOKE response measured without changing the pump-probe geometry is delayed by several picoseconds. This suggests a genuine magnetization response as opposed to instantaneous changes of optical constants as the origin of the signal. We model the propagation of longitudinal acoustic picosecond strain pulses and incorporate the inverse magnetostriction effect via a magnetoelastic term in the effective field of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with large damping. This reproduces not only the delay of the pulsed response, but also unveils the dominant contribution of quasi-static strain to the magnetization dynamics due to the thermal expansion in the optically probed near-surface region. Our experiments exemplify that purely longitudinal strain along the out-of-plane direction of the thin film enables efficient magnetoelastic coupling via the shear strain components arising in the oblique crystallographic frame of reference.</description>

Abstract: Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.</description>

      <title>aLLoyM: A large language model for alloy phase diagram prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions, temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we curated question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&amp;A formats: multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete benchmarking Q&amp;A dataset, on Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Inverse Lieb Materials: Altermagnetism and More</title>

Abstract: The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large N\'eel temperature ($\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title>

Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.046802}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a "self-Moir\'e" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shift and optical vorticity in the steady photovoltaic current</title>

Abstract: Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here, we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called alpha and beta relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the alpha process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a beta process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (alpha) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no beta relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Temperature Induced Transition and Convergence of Thermal Conductivity in Germanene Monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an anomalous temperature-induced transition in thermal conductivity in germanene monolayer around a critical temperature $T_c = 350 \, \text{K}$. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal a transition from $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ scaling below $T_c$ to $\kappa \sim T^{-1/2}$ above, contrasting with conventional $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ behavior. This anomalous scaling correlates with the long-scale characteristic timescale $\tau_2$ obtained from double exponential fitting of the heat current autocorrelation function. Phonon mode analysis using normal mode decomposition indicates that a redshift in ZO phonons reduces the acoustic-optical phonon gap, causing an overlap, enhances the phonon-phonon scattering, driving the anomalous scaling behavior. Moreover, nonequilibrium simulations find a convergent thermal conductivity of germanene with sample size, in agreement with mode coupling theory, owing to the high scattering of ZA phonons due to the inherent buckling of germanene.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

Abstract: Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. This allows us to conclusively address the long-standing discrepancies in Jupiter's adiabat among earlier studies, demonstrating the potential of our approach for providing reliable equations of state of diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behaviour confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after buckling, followed by membrane yielding. Based on the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling strength and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructures of low-density closed-cell foams.</description>

      <title>Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</description>

      <title>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content, widely employed in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments.</description>

Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</description>

      <title>Windowing in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy: resolving resonances in thin-film samples</title>

Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing remains one of the most widely adopted strategies to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Although other analysis techniques exist, including parametric spectral estimation, this study focuses on formalizing windowing-based processing into an accessible experimental workflow. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Hall Effect with Extended Topologically Protected Features in Altermangetic Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>

Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnon hydrodynamics in collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs). Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and exploring collective spin transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Unexpectedly large entropic barrier controls bond rearrangements in vitrimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.</description>
