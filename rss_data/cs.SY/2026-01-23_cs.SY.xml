      <title>Semantics in Actuation Systems: From Age of Actuation to Age of Actuated Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the timeliness of actions in communication systems where actuation is constrained by control permissions or energy availability. Building on the Age of Actuation (AoA) metric, which quantifies the timeliness of actions independently of data freshness, we introduce a new metric, the \emph{Age of Actuated Information (AoAI)}. AoAI captures the end-to-end timeliness of actions by explicitly accounting for the age of the data packet at the moment it is actuated. We analyze and characterize both AoA and AoAI in discrete-time systems with data storage capabilities under multiple actuation scenarios. The actuator requires both a data packet and an actuation opportunity, which may be provided by a controller or enabled by harvested energy. Data packets may be stored either in a single-packet buffer or an infinite-capacity queue for future actuation. For these settings, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoA and AoAI and investigate their structural differences. While AoA and AoAI coincide in instantaneous actuation systems, they differentiate when data buffering is present. Our results reveal counterintuitive regimes in which increasing update or actuation rates degrade action timeliness for both AoA and AoAI. Moreover, as part of the analysis, we obtain a novel closed-form characterization of the steady-state distribution of a Geo/Geo/1 queue operating under the FCFS discipline, expressed solely in terms of the queue length and the age of the head-of-line packet. The proposed metrics and analytical results provide new insights into the semantics of timeliness in systems where information ultimately serves the purpose of actuation.</description>

      <title>Design, Modelling, and Control of Magnetic Ball Suspension System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the modeling, control design, and performance analysis of a Magnetic Ball Suspension System (MBSS), a nonlinear and inherently unstable electromechanical system used in various precision applications. The system's primary objective is to levitate a steel ball using electromagnetic force without physical contact, thereby eliminating frictional losses. A comprehensive state-space model was developed, capturing both the mechanical and electrical dynamics. The equilibrium points of the system were determined through feedback linearization using the Jacobian matrix. To ensure system stability, controllability and observability analyses were conducted, confirming that state feedback and observer-based control strategies could be effectively implemented. Three distinct control methods were explored: pole placement-based state feedback control, full-order observer design, and optimal state feedback control using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Each control strategy was validated through Simulink simulations for both linearized and nonlinear models. Simulation results demonstrated that the linearized system consistently achieved desired performance with minimal oscillations, whereas the nonlinear system exhibited significant transient oscillations before stabilization. The full-order observer enhanced estimation accuracy, enabling effective control where direct state measurement was impractical. The LQR-based control offered improved robustness and minimized control effort, though its performance was comparable to standard state feedback in some cases.</description>

      <title>Bridging Qualitative Rubrics and AI: A Binary Question Framework for Criterion-Referenced Grading in Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PURPOSE OR GOAL: This study investigates how GenAI can be integrated with a criterion-referenced grading framework to improve the efficiency and quality of grading for mathematical assessments in engineering. It specifically explores the challenges demonstrators face with manual, model solution-based grading and how a GenAI-supported system can be designed to reliably identify student errors, provide high-quality feedback, and support human graders. The research also examines human graders' perceptions of the effectiveness of this GenAI-assisted approach. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The study found that GenAI achieved an overall grading accuracy of 92.5%, comparable to two experienced human graders. The two researchers, who also served as subject demonstrators, perceived the GenAI as a helpful second reviewer that improved accuracy by catching small errors and provided more complete feedback than they could manually. A central outcome was the significant enhancement of formative feedback. However, they noted the GenAI tool is not yet reliable enough for autonomous use, especially with unconventional solutions. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY: This study demonstrates that GenAI, when paired with a structured, criterion-referenced framework using binary questions, can grade engineering mathematical assessments with an accuracy comparable to human experts. Its primary contribution is a novel methodological approach that embeds the generation of high-quality, scalable formative feedback directly into the assessment workflow. Future work should investigate student perceptions of GenAI grading and feedback.</description>

      <title>Virtual Traffic Police: Large Language Model-Augmented Traffic Signal Control for Unforeseen Incidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive traffic signal control (TSC) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in managing dynamic traffic flows. However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Power-Electronics-Dominated Grids Using Scaled Relative Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to stability analysis for grid-connected converters utilizing Scaled Relative Graphs (SRG). Our method effectively decouples grid and converter dynamics, thereby establishing a comprehensive and efficient framework for evaluating closed-loop stability. Our analysis accommodates both linear and non-linear loads, enhancing its practical applicability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our stability assessment remains unaffected by angular variations resulting from dq-frame transformations, significantly increasing the method's robustness and versatility. The effectiveness of our approach is validated in several simulation case studies, which illustrate its broad applicability in modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Tactile Sensing System and Soft Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning for Inclusion Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Dynamic Tactile Sensing System that utilizes robotic tactile sensing in conjunction with reinforcement learning to locate and characterize embedded inclusions. A dual arm robot is integrated with an optical Tactile Imaging Sensor that utilizes the Soft Actor Critic Algorithm to acquire tactile data based on a pixel intensity reward. A Dynamic Interrogation procedure for tactile exploration is developed that enables the robot to first localize inclusion and refine their positions for precise imaging. Experimental validation conducted on Polydimethylsiloxane phantoms demonstrates that the robot using the Tactile Soft Actor Critic Model was able to achieve size estimation errors of 2.61% and 5.29% for soft and hard inclusions compared to 7.84% and 6.87% for expert human operators. Results also show that Dynamic Tactile Sensing System was able to locate embedded inclusions and autonomously determine their mechanical properties, useful in applications such as breast tumor characterization.</description>

      <title>Interconnection-based Model Reduction for Linear Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the model reduction problem for linear hybrid systems via the interconnection-based technique called moment matching. We consider two classical interconnections, namely the direct and swapped interconnections, in the hybrid setting, and we present families of reduced-order models for each interconnection via a hybrid characterisation of the steady-state responses. By combining the results for each interconnection, the design of a reduced-order model that achieves moment matching simultaneously for both interconnections is studied. In addition, we show that the presented results have simplified counterparts when the jumps of the hybrid system are periodic. A numerical simulation is finally given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Barrier Functions under State Estimation: From Euclidean Space to Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety for autonomous systems under uncertainty remains challenging, particularly when safety of the true state is required despite the true state not being fully known. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become widely adopted as safety filters. However, standard CBF formulations do not explicitly account for state estimation uncertainty and its propagation, especially for stochastic systems evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information. The proposed framework explicitly incorporates the uncertainty arising from both process and measurement noise, and synthesizes controllers that adapt to the level of uncertainty. The framework admits closed-form solutions in linear settings, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on systems whose state spaces range from Euclidean space to Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Preparation and Motion Study of Magnetically Driven Micro Soft Robot Mimicking the Cownose Ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In narrow, unstructured underwater environments such as environmental monitoring and minimally invasive medical procedures, micro soft robots exhibit unique advantages due to their flexible movement capabilities and small size. At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces.</description>

      <title>Applicability and Limitation Analysis of PMU Data and Phasor Concept for Low- and High- Frequency Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) convert high-speed waveform data into low-speed phasor data, which are fundamental to wide-area monitoring and control in power systems, with oscillation detection and localization among their most prominent applications. However, representing electrical waveform signals with oscillations using PMU phasors is effective only for low-frequency oscillations. This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems.</description>

      <title>DualShield: Safe Model Predictive Diffusion via Reachability Analysis for Interactive Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for multimodal motion planning in autonomous driving. However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions. Simulations in challenging unprotected U-turn scenarios demonstrate that DualShield significantly improves both safety and task efficiency compared to leading methods from different planning paradigms under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Time-Optimal Switching Surfaces for Triple Integrator under Full Box Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for triple integrator under full box constraints is a fundamental problem in the field of optimal control, which has been widely applied in the industry. However, scenarios involving asymmetric constraints, non-stationary boundary conditions, and active position constraints pose significant challenges. This paper provides a complete characterization of time-optimal switching surfaces for the problem, leading to novel insights into the geometric and algebraic structure of the optimal control. The active condition of position constraints is derived, which is absent from the literature. An efficient algorithm is proposed, capable of planning time-optimal trajectories under asymmetric full constraints and arbitrary boundary states, with a 100% success rate. Computational time for each trajectory is within approximately 10{\mu}s, achieving a 5-order-of-magnitude reduction compared to optimization-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Improve the autonomy of the SE2(3) group based Extended Kalman Filter for Integrated Navigation: Theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of core advantages of the SE2(3) Lie group framework for navigation modeling lies in the autonomy of error propagation. Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy.</description>

Abstract: One of the core advantages of SE2(3) Lie group framework for navigation modeling lies in the autonomy of error propagation. In the previous paper, the theoretical analysis of autonomy property of navigation model in inertial, earth and world frames was given. A construction method for SE2(3) group navigation model is proposed to improve the non-inertial navigation model toward full autonomy. This paper serves as a counterpart to previous paper and conducts the real-world strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/odometer(ODO) experiments as well as Monte-Carlo simulations to demonstrate the performance of improved SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models.</description>

Abstract: We propose average unfairness as a new measure of fairness in routing games, defined as the ratio between the average latency and the minimum latency experienced by users. This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing.</description>

      <title>Robust Output Tracking for Induced Seismicity Mitigation in Underground Reservoirs Governed by a Nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust output-feedback controller for induced seismicity mitigation in geological reservoirs described by a coupled 3D PDE-ODE model. The controller is a MIMO Super-Twisting design, producing a continuous control signal and requiring minimal model information, while accommodating parameter uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity. Two operational outputs are regulated simultaneously: regional pressures and seismicity rates computed over reservoir sub-regions. Closed-loop properties are established via explicit bounds on the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional dynamics and the nonlinear ODE system, yielding finite-time or exponential convergence of the tracking errors. The method is evaluated on a Groningen gas-field case study in two scenarios: gas production while not exceeding the intrinsic seismicity of the region, and combined production with CO$_2$ injection toward net-zero operation. Simulations demonstrate accurate tracking of pressure and seismicity targets across regions under significant parameter uncertainty, supporting safer reservoir operation without sacrificing production objectives.</description>

      <title>Data-Enabled Predictive Control and Guidance for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully data-driven control framework for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC). The approach eliminates the need for explicit hydrodynamic modeling by exploiting measured input-output data to predict and optimize future system behavior. Classic DeePC was employed in the heading control, while a cascaded DeePC architecture is proposed for depth regulation. For 3-D waypoint path following, the Adaptive Line-of-Sight algorithm is extended to a predictive formulation and integrated with DeePC. All methods are validated in extensive simulation on the REMUS~100 AUV and compared with classical PI/PID control. The results demonstrate superior tracking performance and robustness of DeePC under ocean-current disturbances and nonlinear operating conditions, while significantly reducing modeling effort.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Demand Response on Short-Circuit Current via a Unit Commitment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In low-carbon grids, system flexibility can be enhanced through mechanisms such as Demand Response (DR), enabling the efficient utilization of renewable energy. However, as Synchronous Generators (SGs) are being replaced by renewable energy sources characterized by Inverter-Based Resources (IBR), system stability is severely affected. Due to the limited overload capability of IBRs, their Short-Circuit Current (SCC) contribution is much smaller than that of SGs. As a result, protection devices may fail to trip during faults. Consequently, the remaining SGs play a key role in providing sufficient SCC. Since the commitment of SGs is closely related to system loading conditions, DR can indirectly affect their SCC provision, a relationship that has not yet been investigated in the literature. Therefore, this paper incorporates both DR and SCC constraints into a unit commitment problem and conducts case studies on an IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that although DR can reduce total costs by adjusting power demand, it may also lead to inadequate SCC levels. Nevertheless, when flexible loads are properly coordinated with SCC requirements, the total cost increases by only 0.3%, which is significantly lower than the cost of system dispatch without DR. This demonstrates that DR can facilitate stable system operation in a cost-effective manner.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication for Low-Altitude Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dense concentration of low-altitude, slow-speed, and small-size targets in the complex low-altitude environment poses significant security challenges, including failures in continuous wide-area sensing and ambiguous target intent, which existing regulatory frameworks struggle to address. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), a hallmark of next-generation mobile communication, offers a transformative approach to low-altitude security governance. By leveraging existing cellular infrastructure and spectrum resources, ISAC enables the construction of a seamless wide-area sensing network, supports intelligent feature extraction and intent inference, facilitates real-time collaborative decision-making, and establishes a dynamic trust authentication framework. This article systematically reviews the technical system, analyzes the security challenges, forecasts the enabling value of ISAC, and discusses the resulting open problems and challenges, thereby laying a foundation for future research and industrial implementation.</description>

      <title>An Ion-Intercalation Memristor for Enabling Full Parallel Writing in Crossbar Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.</description>

      <title>Control Occupation Kernel Regression for Nonlinear Control-Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.00103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents an algorithm for obtaining an approximation of a nonlinear high order control affine dynamical system. Controlled trajectories of the system are leveraged as the central unit of information via embedding them in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vvRKHS). The trajectories are embedded as the so-called higher order control occupation kernels which represent an operator on the vvRKHS corresponding to iterated integration after multiplication by a given controller. The solution to the system identification problem is then the unique solution of an infinite dimensional regularized regression problem. The representer theorem is then used to express the solution as finite linear combination of these occupation kernels, which converts an infinite dimensional optimization problem to a finite dimensional optimization problem. The vector valued structure of the Hilbert space allows for simultaneous approximation of the drift and control effectiveness components of the control affine system. Several experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Compensated Model Predictive Control for Off-road Driving on Unknown Deformable Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning Compensated Model Predictive Controller (AC2MPC) designed for high-speed, off-road autonomous driving on deformable terrains. Addressing the difficulty of modeling unknown tire-terrain interaction and ensuring real-time control feasibility and performance, this framework integrates deep reinforcement learning with a model predictive controller to manage unmodeled nonlinear dynamics. We evaluate the controller framework over constant and varying velocity profiles using high-fidelity simulator Project Chrono. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers over three unknown terrains that represent sandy deformable track, sandy and rocky track and cohesive clay-like deformable soil track. Despite varied and previously unseen terrain characteristics, this framework generalized well enough to track longitudinal reference speeds with the least error. Furthermore, this framework required significantly less training data compared to purely learning based controller, converging in fewer steps while delivering better performance. Even when under-trained, this controller outperformed the standalone controllers, highlighting its potential for safer and more efficient real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Implementing Optimal Taxation: A Constrained Optimization Framework for Tax Reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While optimal taxation theory provides clear prescriptions for tax design, translating these insights into actual tax codes remains difficult. Existing work largely offers theoretical characterizations of optimal systems, while practical implementation methods are scarce. Bridging this gap involves designing tax rules that meet theoretical goals, while accommodating administrative, distributional, and other practical constraints that arise in real-world reform. We develop a method casting tax reform as a constrained optimization problem by parametrizing the entire income tax code as a set of piecewise linear functions mapping tax-relevant inputs into liabilities and marginal rates. This allows users to impose constraints on marginal rate schedules, limits on income swings, and objectives like revenue neutrality, efficiency, simplicity, or distributional fairness that reflect both theoretical and practical considerations. The framework is computationally tractable for complex tax codes and flexible enough to accommodate diverse constraints, welfare objectives and behavioral responses. Whereas existing tools are typically used for ex-post `what-if' analysis of specific reforms, our framework explicitly incorporates real-world reform constraints and jointly optimizes across the full tax code. We illustrate the framework in several simulated settings, including a detailed reconstruction of the Dutch income tax system. For the Dutch case, we generate a family of reforms that smooth existing spikes in marginal tax rates to any desired cap, reduce the number of rules, and impose hard caps on income losses households can experience from the reform. We also introduce \texttt{TaxSolver}, an open-source package, allowing policymakers and researchers to implement and extend the framework.</description>

      <title>PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</description>
