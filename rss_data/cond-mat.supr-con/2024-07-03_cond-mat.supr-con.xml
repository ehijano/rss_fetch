      <title>Nonreciprocal superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of nonreciprocal superconductors where inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, giving rise to an asymmetric energy dispersion. We demonstrate that nonreciprocal superconductivity can be detected by Andreev reflection. In particular, a transparent junction between a normal metal and a nonreciprocal superconductor generally exhibits an asymmetric current-voltage characteristic, which serves as a defining feature of nonreciprocal superconductivity. Unlike the superconducting diode effects, our detection scheme has the advantage of avoiding large critical currents that turn the superconducting state to normal. Finally, we discuss candidates for nonreciprocal superconductivity, including graphene, UTe2, as well as engineered platforms.</description>

      <title>Phase jumps in Josephson junctions with time-dependent spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions (JJs), based on common superconductors and III-V semiconductors, are sought for Majorana states and fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, with gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we show that the range of potential applications of such JJs becomes much broader. The time-dependent SOC offers unexplored mechanisms for switching JJs, accompanied by the $2\pi$-phase jumps and the voltage pulses corresponding to the single-flux-quantum transitions, key to high-speed and low-power superconducting electronics. In a constant applied magnetic field, with Rashba and Dresselhaus SOC, anharmonic current-phase relations, calculated microscopically in these JJs, yield a nonreciprocal transport and superconducting diode effect. Together with the time-dependent SOC, this allows us to identify a switching mechanism at no applied current bias which supports fractional-flux-quantum superconducting circuits and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Vortex confinement through an unquantized magnetic flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically confined superconductors often experience a breakdown in the quantization of magnetic flux owing to the incomplete screening of the supercurrent against the field penetration. In this study, we report that the confinement of a magnetic field occurs regardless of the dimensionality of the system, extending even to 1D linear potential systems. By utilizing a vector-field magnetic force microscope, we successfully create a vortex-antivortex pair connected by a 1D unquantized magnetic flux in ultra-thin superconducting films. Through an investigation of the manipulation and thermal behavior of the vortex pair, we uncover a long-range interaction mediated by the unquantized magnetic flux. These findings suggest a universal phenomenon of unquantized magnetic flux formation, independent of the geometry of the system. Our results present an experimental route for probing the impact of confinement on superconducting properties and order parameters in unconventional superconductors characterized by extremely low dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Majorana multipole response with magnetic point group symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana fermions (MFs) in a topological superconductor exhibit anisotropic electromagnetic responses, called Majorana multipole responses, when MFs are degenerate under time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. In time-reversal symmetric systems, the Majorana multipole response relates to Cooper pair symmetry in the underlying superconducting material, which provides a way to identify pairing symmetries through surface-spin-sensitive measurements. Here, we extend the concept of Majorana multipole response to systems with magnetic point group symmetry that break time-reversal symmetry and clarify how the response of MFs includes information about underlying superconductors. From a topological classification of symmetry-protected MFs and an effective surface theory, we classify possible magnetic and electric responses for MFs, which manifests a direct connection to Cooper pair symmetry for a symmetry-enforced pair of MFs. Additionally, we find several time-reversal-even higher-order multipole responses, such as the quadrupole response, which are forbidden in time-reversal symmetric systems, whereby indicating breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The theory is applied to the odd-parity chiral superconductor UTe$_2$ and the ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe, demonstrating the appearance of a magnetic quadrupole response on a surface.</description>

      <title>Unconventional p-wave and finite-momentum superconductivity induced by altermagnetism through the formation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the Fulde-Ferrell state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Technology of fabrication superconducting free-standing structures (FSS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a method for fabrication of superconducting microstructures that are partially or completely isolated from the substrate has been proposed. Two configurations of suspended microbridges have been suggested, i. e., the first structure that features a T-shaped etching of the substrate and the second structure which is completely separated from the substrate through periodically positioned supports. The creation of suspended structures is based on the principle of gas-phase etching of amorphous silicon oxide in a mixture of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ethanol gases. In the course of the experiments, it has been discovered that suspending micro-structures in the configuration of a micro-bridge results in a slight reduction in superconducting characteristics, ranging from 10 to 15% of the initial parameters. It has also been demonstrated that the thermal coupling between the film and the substrate significantly affects the dissipation of thermal energy. The power dissipated into the substrate at room temperature can vary by up to 250 times based on the value of the micro-bridge undercutting.</description>

      <title>Approximate symmetries, insulators, and superconductivity in continuum-model description of twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we analyze the correlated physics in this system in the framework of a continuum model for the moir\'e superlattice. Using the symmetries in a fine-tuned limit of the system, we identify the strong-coupling ground states and their fate when the perturbations caused by finite bandwidth, displacement field, and the phase of the intralayer potential are taken into account. We classify the superconducting instabilities and, employing a spin-fermion-like model, study the superconducting instabilities in proximity to these insulating particle-hole orders. This reveals that only a neighboring intervalley coherent phase (with zero or finite wave vector) is naturally consistent with the observed superconducting state. Depending on details, the superconductor will be nodal or a chiral gapped state while further including electron-phonon coupling leads to a fully gapped, time-reversal symmetric pairing state.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the quantum critical line in the Schmid transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schmid predicted that a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase when the shunt resistance $R$ exceeds the resistance quantum $h/(4 e^ 2)$. Recent measurements and theoretical studies have sparked a debate on whether the location of this transition depends on the ratio between the Josephson and the charging energies. We employ a combination of multiple innovative analytical and numerical techniques, never before explicitly applied to this problem, to decisively demonstrate that the transition line between superconducting and insulating behavior is indeed independent of this energy ratio. First, we apply field-theory renormalization group methods and find that the $\beta$ function vanishes along the critical line up to the third order in the Josephson energy. We then identify a simple fermionic model that precisely captures the low-energy physics on the critical line, regardless of the energy ratio. This conformally invariant fermionic model is verified by comparing the expected spectrum with exact diagonalization calculations of the resistively shunted Josephson junction, showing excellent agreement even for moderate system sizes. Importantly, this identification provides a rigorous non-perturbative proof that the transition line is maintained at $R=h/(4 e^ 2)$ for all ratios of Josephson to charging energies. The line is further resilient to other ultraviolet cutoffs such as the plasma frequency of the resistive environment. Finally, we implement an adiabatic approach to validate the duality at large Josephson energy.</description>

      <title>In-situ topotactic chemical reaction for spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topotactic chemical reaction (TCR) is a chemical process that transforms one crystalline phase to another while maintaining one or more of the original structural frameworks, typically induced by the local insertion, removal, or replacement of atoms in a crystal. The utilization of TCR in atomic-layer materials and surfaces of bulk crystals leads to exotic quantum phases, as highlighted by the control of topological phases, the emergence of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity, and the realization of 2D ferromagnetism. Advanced surface-sensitive spectroscopies such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are leading techniques to visualize the electronic structure of such exotic states and provide us a guide to further functionalize material properties. In this review article, we summarize the recent progress in this field, with particular emphasis on intriguing results obtained by combining spectroscopies and TCR in thin films.</description>

      <title>Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in topological insulator nanowires proximitized by Nb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon that creates/detects Cooper-pair correlations between distant places. It is also the basis of Cooper-pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although CAR has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, it has been very difficult to observe it in a topological insulator (TI). Here we report the first observation of CAR in a proximitized TI nanowire (TINW). We performed local and nonlocal conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic TINW devices in which superconducting (Nb) and metallic (Pt/Au) contacts are made on a bulk-insulating TINW. The local conductance detected a hard gap, accompanied by the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero-bias, while a negative nonlocal conductance was occasionally observed upon sweeping the chemical potential, giving evidence for CAR. Surprisingly, the CAR signal was detected even over 1.5 $\mu$m, which implies that pair correlations extend over a length scale much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either Nb or the proximitised TINW. Such a long-range CAR effect is possibly due to an intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Also, our 0.9-$\mu$m device presented a decent Cooper-pair splitting efficiency of up to 0.5.</description>

      <title>Absence of $E_{2g}$ nematic instability and dominant $A_{1g}$ response in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since the discovery of the charge density wave (CDW) transition in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, the nature of its symmetry breaking is under intense debate. While evidence suggests that the rotational symmetry is already broken at the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$), an additional electronic nematic instability well below $T_{\rm CDW}$ has been reported based on the diverging elastoresistivity coefficient in the anisotropic channel ($m_{E_{2g}}$). Verifying the existence of a nematic transition below $T_{\rm CDW}$ is not only critical for establishing the correct description of the CDW order parameter, but also important for understanding low-temperature superconductivity. Here, we report elastoresistivity measurements of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ using three different techniques probing both isotropic and anisotropic symmetry channels. Contrary to previous reports, we find the anisotropic elastoresistivity coefficient $m_{E_{2g}}$ is temperature-independent, except for a step jump at $T_{\rm CDW}$. The absence of nematic fluctuations is further substantiated by measurements of the elastocaloric effect, which show no enhancement associated with nematic susceptibility. On the other hand, the symmetric elastoresistivity coefficient $m_{A_{1g}}$ increases below $T_{\rm CDW}$, reaching a peak value of 90 at $T^* = 20$ K. Our results strongly indicate that the phase transition at $T^*$ is not nematic in nature and the previously reported diverging elastoresistivity is due to the contamination from the $A_{1g}$ channel.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superfluidity from a particle-number-conserving perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate odd-in-time - or odd-frequency - pairing of fermions in equilibrium systems within the particle-number-conserving framework of Penrose, Onsager and Yang, where superfluid order is defined by macroscopic eigenvalues of reduced density matrices. We show that odd-frequency pair correlations are synonymous with even fermion-exchange symmetry in a time-dependent correlation function that generalises the two-body reduced density matrix. Macroscopic even-under-fermion-exchange pairing is found to emerge from conventional Penrose-Onsager-Yang condensation in two-body or higher-order reduced density matrices through the symmetry-mixing properties of the Hamiltonian. We identify and characterise a transformer matrix responsible for producing macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations that coexist with a conventional Cooper-pair condensate, while a generator matrix is shown to be responsible for creating macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations from hidden orders such as a multi-particle condensate. The transformer scenario is illustrated using the spin-balanced s-wave superfluid with Zeeman splitting as an example. The generator scenario is demonstrated by the composite-boson condensate arising for itinerant electrons coupled to magnetic excitations. Structural analysis of the transformer and generator matrices is shown to provide general conditions for odd-frequency pairing order to arise in a given system. Our formalism facilitates a fully general derivation of the Meissner effect for odd-frequency superconductors that holds also beyond the regime of validity for mean-field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the BCS critical temperature on half-spaces in dimensions $d=1,2,3$ with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that the critical temperature on a half-space is strictly higher than on $\mathbb{R}^d$, at least at weak coupling in $d=1,2$ and weak coupling and small chemical potential in $d=3$. Furthermore, we show that the relative shift in critical temperature vanishes in the weak coupling limit.</description>
