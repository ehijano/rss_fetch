      <title>Exploiting a Shortcoming of Coupled-Cluster Theory: The Extent of non-Hermiticity as a Diagnostic Indicator of Computational Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental non-Hermitian nature of the forms of coupled-cluster (CC) theory widely used in quantum chemistry has usually been viewed as a negative, but the present letter shows how this can be used to advantage. Specifically, the non-symmetric nature of the reduced one-particle density matrix (in the molecular orbital basis) is advocated as a diagnostic indicator of computational quality. In the limit of full coupled-cluster theory (which is equivalent to full configuration interaction (FCI)), the electronic wavefunction and correlation energy are exact within a given one-particle basis set and the symmetric character of the exact density matrix is recovered. The extent of the density matrix asymmetry is shown to provide a measure of ``how difficult the problem is'' (like the well-known T$_1$ diagnostic), but its variation with level of theory also gives information about ``how well this particular method works'', irrespective of the difficulty of the problem at hand. The proposed diagnostic is described and applied to a select group of small molecules, and an example of its overall utility for the practicing quantum chemist is illustrated through its application to the beryllium dimer (Be$_2$). Future applications of this idea to excited states, open-shell systems, symmetry-breaking problems and extension of the method to the two-particle density are then proposed.</description>

      <title>Ion beam treatment of thick polystyrene films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spincoated polystyrene films of different thickness from 78 nm to 1.3 {\mu}m on silicon wafers were treated by nitrogen ions with an energy of 20 keV. Ellipsometric measurements and FTIR spectra showed modification of the surface layer corresponding to the depth of ion penetration into the polymer (about 70 nm). However, washing of the deep layers and subsequent measurements showed that free radicals formed in the thin modified layer migrated into the bulk layer and caused a number of changes in the chemical structure of the deep polystyrene layer. Thus, despite the small depth of ion penetration into the polystyrene film, the entire film is modified to a depth much greater than the projective range of ions. Therefore, the ion beam treatment of a polymer is a surface modification method only conditionally. It is necessary to take into account free-radical reactions and the possibility of their migration into the deep layers of the polymer.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Inverted Singlet-Triplet Gap in Alternant Hydrocarbons with Heteroatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifth-generation organic light-emitting diodes exhibit delayed fluorescence even at low temperatures, enabled by exothermic reverse intersystem crossing from a negative singlet-triplet gap (STG), where the first excited singlet lies anomalously below the triplet. This phenomenon -- termed delayed fluorescence from inverted singlet and triplet states (DFIST) -- has been experimentally confirmed only in two triangular molecules with a 12-annulene periphery and a central nitrogen atom. Here, we report a high-throughput virtual screening of 30,797 BN-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons derived from 77 parent scaffolds (2--6 rings). Using a multi-level workflow combining structural stability criteria with accurate L-CC2 excited-state calculations, we identify 72 heteroaromatic candidates with STGs$&lt;0$. Notably, this includes BN-helicenes, where inversion arises from through-space charge-transfer states. Several systems exhibit non-zero oscillator strengths, supporting their potential as fluorescent emitters. Our findings reveal new design motifs for DFIST beyond known frameworks, expanding the chemical space for next-generation emitters based on heteroatom-embedded aromatic systems.</description>

      <title>Compositional Analysis of Fragrance Accords Using Femtosecond Thermal Lens Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing complex, multi-component volatile organic compound mixtures, relevant to fragrance formulation, is a significant challenge. While femtosecond thermal lens spectroscopy (FTLS) - encompassing Z-scan and time-resolved techniques - offers powerful tools for probing thermo-optical properties, its application to mixtures beyond a few components is largely unexplored. We present a unified analysis approach for FTLS data from liquid fragrance accords, utilizing an Integrated Magnitude (IM) metric. FTL-IM is a positive-definite measure of the overall signal magnitude, calculated by integrating the processed signal absolute value of signals, and captures the total thermal dissipation dynamics, including contributions from convection. We demonstrate consistency and linear additivity of the FTL-IM with respect to component mass fractions across single-beam, dual-beam, and time-resolved measurements, even when including components with unknown individual thermal lens properties. Our metric demonstrates the necessity of single-beam measurements to explain signal trends in dual-beam data. This robust, rapid technique offers significant advantages for fragrance quality control and formulation development, providing a foundation for linking liquid-phase thermal lens properties to quantitative fragrance compounding.</description>

      <title>An Efficient scaled opposite-spin MP2 method for periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop SOS-RILT-MP2, an efficient Gaussian-based periodic scaled opposite-spin second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (SOS-MP2) algorithm that utilizes the resolution-of-the-identity approximation (RI) combined with the Laplace transform technique (LT). In our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 157, 174112 (2022)], we showed that SOS-MP2 yields better predictions of the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and cohesive energy of 12 simple semiconductors and insulators compared to conventional MP2 and some of the leading density functionals. In this work, we present an efficient SOS-MP2 algorithm that has a scaling of O(N4) with the number of atoms N in the unit cell and a reduced scaling with the number of k-points in the Brillouin zone. We implemented and tested our algorithm on both molecular and solid-state systems, confirming the predicted scaling behavior by systematically increasing the number of atoms, the size of the basis set, and the density of k-point sampling. Using the benzene molecular crystal as a case study, we demonstrated that SOS-RILT-MP2 achieves significantly improved efficiency compared to conventional MP2. This efficient algorithm can be used in the future to study complex materials with large unit cells as well as defect structures.</description>

      <title>Dissociation and radiative stabilization of the indene cation: The nature of the C-H bond and astrochemical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indene (C$_9$H$_8$) is the only polycyclic pure hydrocarbon identified in the interstellar medium to date, with an observed abundance orders of magnitude higher than predicted by astrochemical models. The dissociation and radiative stabilization of vibrationally-hot indene cations is investigated by measuring the time-dependent neutral particle emission rate from ions in a cryogenic ion-beam storage ring for up to 100~ms. Time-resolved measurements of the kinetic energy released upon hydrogen atom loss from C$_9$H$_8^+$, analyzed in view of a model of tunneling through a potential energy barrier, provides the dissociation rate coefficient. Master equation simulations of the dissociation in competition with vibrational and electronic radiative cooling reproduce the measured dissociation rate. We find that radiative stabilization arrests one of the main C$_9$H$_8$ destruction channels included in astrochemical models, helping to rationalize its high observed abundance.</description>

      <title>Orbital optimization of large active spaces via AI-accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient orbital optimization procedure that combines the highly GPU accelerated, spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with the complete active space self-consistent field (CAS-SCF) approach for quantum chemistry implemented in the ORCA program package. Leveraging the computational power of the latest generation of Nvidia GPU hardware, we perform CAS-SCF based orbital optimizations for unprecedented CAS sizes of up to 82 electrons in 82 orbitals [CAS(82,82)] in molecular systems comprising of active spaces sizes of hundreds of electrons in thousands of orbitals. For both the NVIDIA DGX-A100 and DGX-H100 hardware, we provide a detailed scaling and error analysis of our DMRG-SCF approach for benchmark systems consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and iron-sulfur complexes of varying sizes. Our efforts demonstrate for the first time that highly accurate DMRG calculations at large bond dimensions are critical for obtaining reliably converged CAS-SCF energies. For the more challenging iron-sulfur benchmark systems, we furthermore find the optimized orbitals of a converged CAS-SCF calculation to depend more sensitively on the DMRG parameters than those for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The ability to obtain converged CAS-SCF energies and orbitals for active spaces of such large sizes within days reduces the challenges of including the appropriate orbitals into the CAS or selecting the correct minimal CAS, and may open up entirely new avenues for tackling strongly correlated molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Mathematical crystal chemistry II: Random search for ionic crystals and analysis on oxide crystals registered in ICSD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical crystal chemistry views crystal structures as the optimal solutions to mathematical optimization problem formalizing inorganic structural chemistry. This paper introduces the minimum and maximum atomic radii depending on the types of geometrical constraints, extending the concept of effective atomic sizes. These radii define permissible interatomic distances instead of interatomic forces, constraining feasible types and connections of coordination polyhedra. The definition shows the aspect that crystal structures are packings of atomic spheres. Additionally, creatability functions for geometrical constraints, which give a choice of creatable types of geometrical constraints depending on the spatial order of atoms, are implemented to guide randomly generated structures toward optimal solutions. The framework identifies unique optimal solutions corresponding to the structures of spinel, pyrochlore ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), pyroxene, quadruple perovskite, cuprate superconductor $\mathrm{YBa}_2 \mathrm{Cu}_3 \mathrm{O}_{7-x}$, and iron-based superconductor $\mathrm{LaFeAsO}$. Notably, up to $95\%$ of oxide crystal structure types in Inorganic Crystal Structure Database align with the optimal solutions preserving experimental structures despite the discretized feasible atomic radii. These findings highlight the role of mathematical optimization problem as a theoretical foundation for mathematical crystal chemistry, enabling efficient structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Length-flexible strategies for efficient SERS performance in gold-nanorod-gapped nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas has shown great potential in various applications. This reflects in their large values of the customary figure of merit of SERS: the enhancement factor (EF), which is essentially the fourth power of the electric field integrated at the gap, the location at which target molecules are to be sensed. However, fabrication errors in the nanorod lengths can lead to significant variations in the enhancement factor, resulting in performance limitations whenever low values of EF are encountered. Here, we report both design and procedural strategies to address this issue. First, we show that by reducing the nanorod diameter from 360 nm to 260 nm, the EF minima can be avoided for any nanorod length, mitigating the impact of fabrication errors. In addition, we explore the influence of incident wave polarization and orientation on the EF. Our simulations reveal that by tilting the excitation away from normal incidence, it is possible to substantially enhance EF under conditions that would otherwise exhibit low enhancement. In particular, this includes the case of 360 nm diameter. These findings expand the fabrication tolerance and broaden the range of usability of gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas, enabling more robust and reliable SERS performance. Importantly, we also show that these strategies also apply to nanoantennas with covered nanorod ends, which are of particular interest for realizing hybrid devices that combine SERS with electrical transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle [Bai \&amp; Breen, \emph{J. Graph. Tools}, \textbf{13}(4), 53, (2008)]. However, this approach involves projecting and averaging of the particles in a non-physically meaningful way resulting in inaccurate centre of masses. Instead the intrinsic weighted average should be computed, but the analytical calculation of this scales as $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$. Here, we propose a more computationally efficient approach to compute the intrinsic mean suitable for the majority of chemical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.09023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the coalescence behavior of the atomic Schr\"odinger wave functions from the angle of an operator product expansion (OPE) within the nonrelativistic Coulomb-Schr\"odinger effective field theory. We take the electron-nucleus coalescence as an explicit example to demonstrate our formalism, where the celebrated Kato's cusp condition can be easily reproduced. An exact OPE relation is rigorously proved to all orders in perturbation theory. Our approach can be readily extended to ascertain the multi-particle coalescence behaviors of atomic wave functions, as well as to take relativistic effects into account.</description>
