      <title>Causal Interventions in Bond Multi-Dealer-to-Client Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitalization of financial markets has shifted trading from voice to electronic channels, with Multi-Dealer-to-Client (MD2C) platforms now enabling clients to request quotes (RfQs) for financial instruments like bonds from multiple dealers simultaneously. In this competitive landscape, dealers cannot see each other's prices, making a rigorous analysis of the negotiation process crucial to ensure their profitability. This article introduces a novel general framework for analyzing the RfQ process using probabilistic graphical models and causal inference. Within this framework, we explore different inferential questions that are relevant for dealers participating in MD2C platforms, such as the computation of optimal prices, estimating potential revenues and the identification of clients that might be interested in trading the dealer's axes. We then move into analyzing two different approaches for model specification: a generative model built on the work of (Fermanian, Gu\'eant &amp; Pu, 2017); and discriminative models utilizing machine learning techniques. We evaluate these methodologies using predictive metrics designed to assess their effectiveness in the context of optimal pricing, highlighting the relative benefits of using models that take into account the internal mechanisms of the negotiation process.</description>

      <title>FinGPT: Enhancing Sentiment-Based Stock Movement Prediction with Dissemination-Aware and Context-Enriched LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding the influence of news on stock prices. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for this purpose due to their advanced text analysis capabilities. However, these models often only consider the news content itself, ignoring its dissemination, which hampers accurate prediction of short-term stock movements. Additionally, current methods often lack sufficient contextual data and explicit instructions in their prompts, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret news. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that enhances LLM-powered sentiment-based stock movement predictions by incorporating news dissemination breadth, contextual data, and explicit instructions. We cluster recent company-related news to assess its reach and influence, enriching prompts with more specific data and precise instructions. This data is used to construct an instruction tuning dataset to fine-tune an LLM for predicting short-term stock price movements. Our experimental results show that our approach improves prediction accuracy by 8\% compared to existing methods.</description>
