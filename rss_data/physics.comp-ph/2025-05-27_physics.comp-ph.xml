      <title>High-order Equivariant Flow Matching for Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a fundamental method for simulating quantum chemical properties, but it remains expensive due to the iterative self-consistent field (SCF) process required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. Recently, deep learning methods are gaining attention as a way to bypass this step by directly predicting the Hamiltonian. However, they rely on deterministic regression and do not consider the highly structured nature of Hamiltonians. In this work, we propose QHFlow, a high-order equivariant flow matching framework that generates Hamiltonian matrices conditioned on molecular geometry. Flow matching models continuous-time trajectories between simple priors and complex targets, learning the structured distributions over Hamiltonians instead of direct regression. To further incorporate symmetry, we use a neural architecture that predicts SE(3)-equivariant vector fields, improving accuracy and generalization across diverse geometries. To further enhance physical fidelity, we additionally introduce a fine-tuning scheme to align predicted orbital energies with the target. QHFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Hamiltonian error by 71% on MD17 and 53% on QH9. Moreover, we further show that QHFlow accelerates the DFT process without trading off the solution quality when initializing SCF iterations with the predicted Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of iterations and runtime.</description>

      <title>Higher order stray field computation on tensor product domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the tensor grid method for stray field computation on rectangular domains that incorporates higher-order basis functions. Both the magnetization and the resulting magnetic field are represented using higher-order B-spline bases, which allow for increased accuracy and smoothness. The method employs a super-potential formulation, which circumvents the need to convolve with a singular kernel. The field is represented with high accuracy as a functional Tucker tensor, leveraging separable expansions on the tensor product domain and trained via a multilinear extension of the extreme learning machine methodology. Unlike conventional grid-based methods, the proposed mesh-free approach allows for continuous field evaluation. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, demonstrating exponential convergence of the energy and linear computational scaling with respect to the multilinear expansion rank.</description>

      <title>Validating The Effectiveness of Electrospun Self Healing Diels Alder Interleaves to Mode I fracture resistance by Comparing Simulation Outputs with Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictive capabilities of the finite element approach were assessed by comparing simulation outputs with experimental results, including load-displacement trends, damage initiation points, and delamination evolution. This comparison validated the effectiveness of the self-healing interleaves and highlighted the strengths and limitations of the adopted numerical framework. The simulations not only reproduced key damage characteristics but also provided a deeper understanding of failure mechanisms in the modified laminates. This modeling strategy contributes to the broader goal of developing high-fidelity virtual testing tools for complex, multifunctional composite structures used in aerospace and related industries.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Damage Evolution in Open Hole CFRP Laminates Modified with Electrospun Self Healing Diels Alder Interleaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study analyzes open hole carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP laminates modified with electrospun interleaves containing Diels Alder-based self-healing agents. It develops a high-fidelity simulation framework to investigate the quasistatic tensile behavior of these composites. The study uses Hashin's failure criteria to capture intralaminar damage and surface-based cohesive contact interactions to model interlaminar delamination. Two interleave configurations are examined: solution electrospinning (SEP) for full thickness coverage and melt electrospinning (MEP) for localized reinforcement. Results show good agreement with experimental data, capturing key failure mechanisms like matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The study emphasizes the importance of spatially resolved cohesive properties and meshing strategies in accurately simulating damage progression.</description>

      <title>Strain Modulated Catalytic Activity of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The catalytic properties of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) in hydrogen-electrode- (HER-) based catalysts have been investigated based on state-of-the-art ab initio simulations. Our results show that the late transition metal sites (Hg and Zn) exhibit the best activity for HER in an acidic environment. Furthermore, lattice stretching and compression can effectively modulate the H binding energy, achieving almost thermoneutral adsorption at 3% compressive strain. The changes are attributed to the modulation in the d-band centers of late transition metal sites, as well as the depletion of charge population on bonding states, contributing to the destabilization of the H-metal bonds. Our contribution explores strain engineering as an effective strategy to tailor the activity of 2D mineral-based catalyst materials for HER, advancing our understanding of how mechanical manipulation can effectively modulate the catalytic properties of these materials.</description>

Abstract: The Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP) at The University of Tokyo has been carrying out a software development project named ``the Project for Advancement of Software Usability in Materials Science (PASUMS)". Since the launch of PASUMS, various open-source software programs have been developed/advanced, including ab initio calculations, effective model solvers, and software for machine learning. We also focus on activities that make the software easier to use, such as developing comprehensive computing tools that enable efficient use of supercomputers and interoperability between different software programs. We hope to contribute broadly to developing the computational materials science community through these activities.</description>

      <title>SPDEBench: An Extensive Benchmark for Learning Regular and Singular Stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) driven by random noise play a central role in modelling physical processes whose spatio-temporal dynamics can be rough, such as turbulence flows, superconductors, and quantum dynamics. To efficiently model these processes and make predictions, machine learning (ML)-based surrogate models are proposed, with their network architectures incorporating the spatio-temporal roughness in their design. However, it lacks an extensive and unified datasets for SPDE learning; especially, existing datasets do not account for the computational error introduced by noise sampling and the necessary renormalization required for handling singular SPDEs. We thus introduce SPDEBench, which is designed to solve typical SPDEs of physical significance (e.g., the $\Phi^4_d$, wave, incompressible Navier--Stokes, and KdV equations) on 1D or 2D tori driven by white noise via ML methods. New datasets for singular SPDEs based on the renormalization process have been constructed, and novel ML models achieving the best results to date have been proposed. In particular, we investigate the impact of computational error introduced by noise sampling and renormalization on the performance comparison of ML models and highlight the importance of selecting high-quality test data for accurate evaluation. Results are benchmarked with traditional numerical solvers and ML-based models, including FNO, NSPDE and DLR-Net, etc. It is shown that, for singular SPDEs, naively applying ML models on data without specifying the numerical schemes can lead to significant errors and misleading conclusions. Our SPDEBench provides an open-source codebase that ensures full reproducibility of benchmarking across a variety of SPDE datasets while offering the flexibility to incorporate new datasets and machine learning baselines, making it a valuable resource for the community.</description>

      <title>DNS and role of round-off error: Two-Dimensional Taylor-Green vortex problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of round-off errors on the receptivity and instability of fluid flows are conclusively established for the first time using high accuracy simulations of the benchmark two-dimensional (2D) Taylor-Green vortex problem using double and quadruple precisions. Employing the fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method for temporal discretization and Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization enables unprecedented accuracy necessary for controlling all forms of errors, except the remaining round-off error. Results clearly show that adopting quadruple precision results in a qualitatively different receptivity route to turbulence and its subsequent decay compared to double precision. Another important observation is the identification of the receptivity phase which has never been reported before. Present study not only establishes the singular role of round-off errors but also has potential ramifications on receptivity and instability of flows due to precision of simulation.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Prediction of Large Thermoelectric Effect in Distorted Heusler Alloy Ti-Fe-Sb Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric figure of merit of the Heusler alloy TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was investigated by first-principles calculations of lattice thermal conductivity. The electronic thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient are calculated by semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was found to be thermally and dynamically stable, as confirmed by its phonon dispersion. Additionally, the small phonon band gap between acoustic and optical modes enhances phonon scattering, leading to a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.703 W/mK at 300 K. Our study also reveals that TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb is a non-magnetic semiconductor. Notably, it demonstrates a significant longitudinal thermoelectric effect, with a Seebeck coefficient of 359.4 $\mu$V/K at 300 K. The combination of low lattice thermal conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient results in a high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.88 and 0.91 at 300 K and 500 K, respectively. These findings highlight the considerable potential of TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb as a promising material for thermoelectric device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research aims to develop a method to reduce the time cost and complexity of balloon expandable stent simulations in cardiovascular stenting procedures for Peripheral Artery Disease. The study uses stereoscopic images to construct a cardiovascular stent and validate its mechanical response through Finite Element testing. A 3D model of the curved common femoral artery was constructed using Computed Tomography of a patient with Critical Limb Ischemia. The fatigue life cycles of the stent were estimated considering sinusoidal cyclic loading. The crimping process has a negligible influence on the mechanical response, with recoil and foreshortening percentages remaining static with increasing stent rings. The numerical results indicate the biomechanical influence of stent placement in a realistic vessel and compare it with literature.</description>

      <title>SESaMo: Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation for Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular, autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation (SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Boundary local time on wedges and prefractal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary local time on polygonal boundaries such as finite generations of the Koch snowflake. To reveal the role of angles, we first focus on wedges and obtain the mean boundary local time, its variance, and the asymptotic behavior of its distribution. Moreover, we establish the coupled partial differential equations for higher-order moments. Next, we propose an efficient multi-scale Monte Carlo approach to simulate the boundary local time, as well as the escape duration and position of the associated reaction event on a polygonal boundary. This numerical approach combines the walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with an approximate solution of the escape problem from a sector. We apply it to investigate how the statistics of the boundary local time depends on the geometric complexity of the Koch snowflake. Eventual applications to diffusion-controlled reactions on partially reactive boundaries, including the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz: efficient quantum circuit design for quantum chemistry and material science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry and material science by offering solutions to complex problems unattainable with classical computers. However, the development of efficient quantum algorithms that are efficient under noisy conditions remains a major challenge. This paper introduces the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (tVHA), a novel circuit design for conducting quantum calculations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. tVHA provides a promising approach for a broad range of applications by utilizing principles from the adiabatic theorem in solid state physics. Our proposed ansatz significantly reduces the parameter count and can decrease circuit size substantially, with a trade-off in accuracy. Thus, tVHA facilitates easier convergence within the variational quantum eigensolver framework compared to state-of-the-art ans\"atze such as Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) and Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA). While this paper concentrates on the practical applications of tVHA in quantum chemistry, demonstrating its suitability for both weakly and strongly correlated systems and its compatibility with active space calculations, its underlying principles suggest a wider applicability extending to the broader field of material science computations on quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deconvolution in Populational Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is focussed on the inversion task of inferring the distribution over parameters of interest leading to multiple sets of observations. The potential to solve such distributional inversion problems is driven by increasing availability of data, but a major roadblock is blind deconvolution, arising when the observational noise distribution is unknown. However, when data originates from collections of physical systems, a population, it is possible to leverage this information to perform deconvolution. To this end, we propose a methodology leveraging large data sets of observations, collected from different instantiations of the same physical processes, to simultaneously deconvolve the data corrupting noise distribution, and to identify the distribution over model parameters defining the physical processes. A parameter-dependent mathematical model of the physical process is employed. A loss function characterizing the match between the observed data and the output of the mathematical model is defined; it is minimized as a function of the both the parameter inputs to the model of the physics and the parameterized observational noise. This coupled problem is addressed with a modified gradient descent algorithm that leverages specific structure in the noise model. Furthermore, a new active learning scheme is proposed, based on adaptive empirical measures, to train a surrogate model to be accurate in parameter regions of interest; this approach accelerates computation and enables automatic differentiation of black-box, potentially nondifferentiable, code computing parameter-to-solution maps. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on porous medium flow, damped elastodynamics, and simplified models of atmospheric dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiple Descents in Deep Learning as a Sequence of Order-Chaos Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe a novel 'multiple-descent' phenomenon during the training process of LSTM, in which the test loss goes through long cycles of up and down trend multiple times after the model is overtrained. By carrying out asymptotic stability analysis of the models, we found that the cycles in test loss are closely associated with the phase transition process between order and chaos, and the local optimal epochs are consistently at the critical transition point between the two phases. More importantly, the global optimal epoch occurs at the first transition from order to chaos, where the 'width' of the 'edge of chaos' is the widest, allowing the best exploration of better weight configurations for learning.</description>

      <title>Transcorrelated Methods for Multireference Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the transcorrelated method to problems of multireference character. For this, we show that the choice of reference wavefunction during the Jastrow optimisation procedure is vital, and we propose a workflow wherein we use conventional multi-configurational methods to provide a reference wavefunction for Jastrow factor optimisation. This Jastrow function is subsequently used with transcorrelated-full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo within the xTC approximation (TC-FCIQMC) to yield highly accurate transcorrelated energies. This is demonstrated for N$_2$ using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set, achieving chemical accuracy across the entire binding curve compared with experiment. We also apply the method to compute excitation energies of dinitrogen, CO and the ammonia molecule, where accurate results, comparable to the best available theoretical predictions, are obtained with modest basis sets.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J. Math. Phys. 11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Rock-Paper-Scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that species interactions often involve long-term memory, with highly-varying waiting times between successive events and long-range temporal correlations. Accounting for memory undermines the common Markovian assumption, and dramatically impacts key ingredients of population dynamics including birth, foraging, predation, and competition processes. Here, we study a critical aspect of population dynamics, namely non-Markovian multi-species competition. This is done in the realm of the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model that is broadly used in the life sciences to metaphorically describe cyclic competition between three interacting species. We develop a general non-Markovian formalism for multi-species dynamics, allowing us to determine the regions of the parameter space where each species dominates. In particular, when the dynamics are Markovian, the waiting times are exponentially distributed and the fate of the zRPS model in large well-mixed populations is encoded in a remarkably simple condition, often referred to as the ``law of the weakest'' (LOW), stating that the species with the lowest growth rate is the most likely to prevail. We show that the survival behavior and LOW of the zRPS model are critically affected by non-exponential waiting times, and especially, by their coefficient of variation. Our findings provide key insight into the influence of long waiting times on non-Markovian evolutionary processes.</description>

      <title>Flow Annealed Importance Sampling Bootstrap meets Differentiable Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy physics requires the generation of large numbers of simulated data samples from complex but analytically tractable distributions called matrix elements. Surrogate models, such as normalizing flows, are gaining popularity for this task due to their computational efficiency. We adopt an approach based on Flow Annealed importance sampling Bootstrap (FAB) that evaluates the differentiable target density during training and helps avoid the costly generation of training data in advance. We show that FAB reaches higher sampling efficiency with fewer target evaluations in high dimensions in comparison to other methods.</description>

      <title>MDDM: A Molecular Dynamics Diffusion Model to Predict Particle Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery and study of new material systems relies on molecular simulations that often come with significant computational expense. We propose MDDM, a Molecular Dynamics Diffusion Model, which is capable of predicting a valid output conformation for a given input pair potential function. After training MDDM on a large dataset of molecular dynamics self-assembly results, the proposed model can convert uniform noise into a meaningful output particle structure corresponding to an arbitrary input potential. The model's architecture has domain-specific properties built-in, such as satisfying periodic boundaries and being invariant to translation. The model significantly outperforms the baseline point-cloud diffusion model for both unconditional and conditional generation tasks.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the three classes can now be treated on the same footing using the frequency domain. The solutions are the first exact and complete description of energy-conserving pendulum in the frequency domain reported in the literature. The key insight is the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequency analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires a tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum.</description>

      <title>XDiag: Exact Diagonalization for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are widely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However, traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability, limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library, providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling. Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling and sound synthesis.</description>
