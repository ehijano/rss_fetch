      <title>Mixed-Mode In-Memory Computing: Towards High-Performance Logic Processing In A Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-memory computing is a promising alternative to traditional computer designs, as it helps overcome performance limits caused by the separation of memory and processing units. However, many current approaches struggle with unreliable device behavior, which affects data accuracy and efficiency. In this work, the authors present a new computing method that combines two types of operations,those based on electrical resistance and those based on voltage, within each memory cell. This design improves reliability and avoids the need for expensive current measurements. A new software tool also helps automate the design process, supporting highly parallel operations in dense two-dimensional memory arrays. The approach balances speed and space, making it practical for advanced computing tasks. Demonstrations include a digital adder and a key part of the encryption module, showing both strong performance and accuracy. This work offers a new direction for reliable and efficient in-memory computing systems with real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Imaging for Damage Detection in Plates Based on Topological Acoustic (TA) Sensing Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional structural damage detection methods in aerospace applications face challenges in accuracy and sensitivity, often necessitating multiple sensors to evaluate various measurement paths between the reference and defective states. However, the recently developed topological acoustic (TA) sensing technique can capture shifts in the geometric phase of an acoustic field, enabling the detection of even minor perturbations in the supporting medium. In this study, a diagnostic imaging method for damage detection in plate structures based on the TA sensing technique is presented. The method extracts the geometric phase shift index (GPS-I) from the Lamb wave response signals to indicate the location of the damage. Using Abaqus/CAE, a finite element model of the plate was established to simulate the Lamb wave response signals, which were then used to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The results indicate that this technique enables rapid and precise identification of damage and its location within the plate structure, requiring response signals from only a few points on the damaged plate, and it is reference-free.</description>

      <title>Deposition-Dependent Coverage and Performance of Phosphonic Acid Interface Modifiers in Halide Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of various deposition methods for phosphonic acid interface modifiers commonly pursued as self-assembled monolayers in high-performance metal halide perovskite photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. We compare the deposition of (2-(3,6-diiodo-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid onto indium tin oxide (ITO) bottom contacts by varying three parameters: the method of deposition, specifically spin coating or prolonged dip coating, ITO surface treatment via HCl/FeCl3 etching, and use in combination with a second modifier, 1,6-hexylenediphosphonic acid. We demonstrate that varying these modification protocols can impact time-resolved photoluminescence carrier lifetimes and quasi-Fermi level splitting of perovskite films deposited onto the phosphonic-acid-modified ITO. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy shows an increase in effective work function after phosphonic acid modification and clear evidence for photoemission from carbazole functional groups at the ITO surface. We use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe differences in phosphonic acid coverage on the metal oxide contact and show that perovskite samples grown on ITO with the highest phosphonic acid coverage exhibit the longest carrier lifetimes. Finally, we establish that device performance follows these same trends. These results indicate that the reactivity, heterogeneity, and composition of the bottom contact help to control recombination rates and therefore power conversion efficiencies. ITO etching, prolonged deposition times for phosphonic acids via dip coating, and the use of a secondary, more hydrophilic bis-phosphonic acid, all contribute to improvements in surface coverage, carrier lifetime, and device efficiency. These improvements each have a positive impact, and we achieve the best results when all three strategies are implemented.</description>

      <title>Future prospect of anisotropic 2D tin sulfide (SnS) for emerging electronic and quantum device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Three-Wave Interaction Grating Coupler with Sub-Decibel Insertion Loss at Normal Incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the design, fabrication in a commercial foundry, and experimental results of high-efficiency, normal incidence grating couplers for silicon photonics. We observe a maximum coupling efficiency of 85.4% (-0.69 dB) with a 1 dB bandwidth of 20 nm at a central wavelength of 1546 nm. These experimental results verify earlier theoretical and simulation results and pave the way for the use of perfectly vertical grating couplers, as an alternative to edge coupling, in silicon photonics applications that are sensitive to input coupling loss. Further, these results enable the use of grating couplers for vertically oriented elements, such as multicore fibers and VCSELs, and address challenges associated with coupling to free space beams.</description>

      <title>Effective interface forces to model boundary effects in a finite-size metamaterial through the reduced relaxed micromorphic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the reduced relaxed micromorphic model (RRMM) to capture the effective "bulk" dynamical response of finite size metamaterial specimens made out of a Labyrinthine unit cell. We show that for small finite-size specimens, boundary effects can play a major role, so that the RRMM needs an enrichment to capture the metamaterial's bulk response, as well as the boundary effects. A benchmark test is introduced to show that different metamaterial/ homogeneous material interfaces can drive completely different responses even if the bulk metamaterial remains the same. We show with no remaining doubts that the concept of "interface forces" must necessarily be introduced if one wants to model finite-size metamaterials in a homogenized framework.</description>

      <title>Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Nanoscale Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond timescales.Our extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric-Metal Phononic Crystal Enabling GHz Tunable Ultrahigh $Q$ Quasi-BIC mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of GHz-frequency, high quality factor ($Q$), and electrically tunable acoustic resonators holds significant potential for advancing applications in quantum information technologies, microwave photonics, and reconfigurable RF systems. However, simultaneously achieving these three characteristics within a single, scalable platform remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a GHz quasi-BIC resonator in a piezoelectric thin-film shear horizontal (SH) wave system, achieved through a structurally simple piezoelectric-metal phononic crystal (PnC) architecture on a LiNbO$_3$ thin film. This approach enables leaky Fabry-Perot coupling mode and localized trapping quasi-BIC mode. Without the need for deep etching or intricate patterning, we achieve a room-temperature quality factor of $6\times 10^4$ at ~1 GHz in ambient air, corresponding to an $f\times Q$ product of $6\times 10^{13}$ Hz at quasi-BIC mode. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficient electrical tunability via low-voltage (0.6 V) electrothermal modulation of the PnC structure, enabling a reversible transition between trapped and transmission states and yielding a high-contrast amplitude modulation of 47.75 dB. Our results establish a lithography-friendly, fabrication-tolerant platform for realizing tunable, high-$Q$ acoustic resonators at GHz frequencies, overcoming longstanding barriers in phononic device engineering. This work opens new directions for scalable on-chip phononic circuits in quantum acoustics, reconfigurable RF systems, and signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Numerically studying Pesticide diffusion in air using Langevin formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of pesticides for enhancing crop yield and preventing infestations is a widespread agricultural practice. However, in recent years, there has been a growing shift toward traditional chemical-free organic farming. Regulatory frameworks impose specific distance requirements between organic farms and neighboring lands where chemical pesticides are used to minimize cross-contamination. In this work, we numerically analyze the spread of pesticide droplets to adjacent fields under varying weather conditions, providing a systematic analysis that highlights conditions where existing guidelines might require reassessment. We employ the formalism of the Langevin equations to model the diffusion of pesticide particles and their transport due to wind and other environmental factors. Assuming a non-relativistic, classical diffusion framework, we track the dispersion of commonly used pesticides to assess their potential contamination range. We present our key findings, discuss their implications, and, toward the end, outline possible directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, along with charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, as diagnostic tools to distinguish Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana-bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR states arise from magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within a trivial s-wave superconducting gap, while MBS emerge in topological superconductors, often leading to ambiguity in experiments where magnetic impurities mimic zero-energy MBS signatures. By replacing the trivial superconductor with a topological one exhibiting triplet pairing (e.g., chiral p or spinless p-wave nanowires), we identify robust and distinguishing features of YSR and MBS states. Our analysis demonstrates that combined measurements of both charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, and their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts offer unique and reliable signatures to differentiate YSR states from genuine MBS, thereby reducing false-positive interpretations in topological superconductivity experiments.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Ultra-Short Pulse Looped Antennas: Radiation and Parametric Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern optical systems send and receive ultra-short temporal pulses (USP). While ultra-broad band antennas do exist in the microwave region (e.g., log-periodic antennas), their short temporal response is typically limited by the antenna's large dispersion, hence, resulting in a substantial pulse broadening. The issue becomes more severe when one considers both the transmitted and received pulses. Through simulations and experiments one can show that properly designed loop antennas, either thick loops or 3-loop antennas, exhibit USP attributes, 280 ps upon transmission and 380 ps upon reception (or, an overall equivalent coherent channel exceeding 2.5 GHz). Finally, most parametric amplifiers are narrow band and one may ask if a broadband amplification is possible. A loop inside a loop system, coupled by a nonlinear impedance element exhibits a line narrowing and signal amplification with large bandwidth, which is inversely scalable with the loops' diameter. In all, these elements could be advantageous for applications such as ultra-wide bandwidth communication and non-linear quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Integrated angstrom-tunable polarization-resolved solid-state photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of high-quality solid-state photon sources is essential to nano optics, quantum photonics, and related fields. A key objective of this research area is to develop tunable photon sources that not only enhance the performance but also offer dynamic functionalities. However, the realization of compact and robust photon sources with precise and wide range tunability remains a long-standing challenge. Moreover, the lack of an effective approach to integrate nanoscale photon sources with dynamic systems has hindered tunability beyond mere spectral adjustments, such as simultaneous polarization control. Here we propose a platform based on quantum emitter (QE) embedded metasurfaces (QEMS) integrated with a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-positioned microcavity, enabling on-chip multi-degree control of solid-state photon sources. Taking advantages of MEMS-QEMS, we show that typically broadband room-temperature emission from nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy centres can be narrowed to 3.7 nm and dynamically tuned with angstrom resolution. Furthermore, we design a wavelength-polarization-multiplexed QEMS and demonstrate polarization-resolved control of the MEMS-QEMS emission in a wide wavelength range (650 nm to 700 nm) along with polarization switching at sub-millisecond timescales. We believe that the proposed MEMS-QEMS platform can be adapted for most existing QEs, significantly expanding their room-temperature capabilities and thereby enhancing their potential for advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable linear and nonlinear enhancement of index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control of optical properties of materials by tuning their refractive index can revolutionize the current state-of-the-art technology to manipulate light propagation in the high loss media. Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of \textit{enhancement of index of refraction} (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. In contrast to classical approach used in \cite{Panahpour2019}, we formulate both first- and second-order quantization to analyze nonlinear enhancement in the refractive index by modulating the response function of probe field. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of nonlinear refractive index which is essential for quantum technological applications. It also provides coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.</description>
