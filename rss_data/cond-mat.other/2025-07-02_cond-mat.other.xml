      <title>Localized and quasi-localized energy levels in the electron spectrum of graphene with isolated boron and nitrogen substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the calculation and analysis of local Green functions of impurity atoms of low concentration in a two-dimensional graphene lattice, the conditions for the formation and characteristics of local discrete levels with energies lying outside the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum and quasi-localized states with energies near the Fermi one are determined. Specific calculations were performed for boron and nitrogen impurity atoms, which can actually replace carbon in graphite and graphene nanostructures. For a boron impurity that forms local discrete levels outside the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum, sufficiently simple analytical expressions for the conditions for their formation, energy, intensity at the impurity atom, and damping parameter are obtained. An analysis of the formation of states quasi-localized on nitrogen impurities with energy near the Fermi level in graphene nanostructures was carried out.</description>

      <title>TeO2-BaO-Bi2O3 tellurite optical glasses II. -- Linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties of TeO$_2$-BaO-Bi$_2$O$_3$ (TeBaBi) glasses prepared by the conventional melt-quenching technique at 900 {\deg}C. Prepared glass composition ranges across the whole glass-forming-ability (GFA) region focusing on mutual substitution trends of constituent oxides, where TeO$_2$: 55-85 mol.%, BaO: 10-35 mol.%, Bi$_2$O$_3$: 5-15 mol.%. Studied glasses exhibit high values of linear ($n_{632} \approx$ 1.922-2.084) and non-linear refractive index ($n_2\approx$1.63-3.45$\times10^{-11}$ esu), Verdet constant ($V_{632} \approx$ 26.7-45.3 radT$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$) and optical band gap energy ($E_g \approx$ 3.1-3.6 eV). The introduction of TeO$_2$ and Bi$_2$O$_3$ results in increase of both linear/non-linear refractive index and Verdet constant, with a more pronounced influence of Bi$_2$O$_3$. Measured spectral dispersion of refractive index and Verdet constant were used for estimation of magneto-optic anomaly parameter ($\gamma \approx$ 0.71-0.92), which may be used for theoretical modelling of magneto-optic response in diamagnetic TeBaBi glasses. Additionally, the properties of the prepared TeBaBi glasses were directly compared to those of the TeO$_2$-ZnO-BaO glass system, which was prepared and characterized under similar experimental conditions. The compositional dependence of the refractive index in both glass systems was described using multilinear regression analysis, demonstrating high correlation and uniformity of estimation across the entire GFA region. This makes them highly promising for precise dispersion engineering and construction of optical devices operating from visible to mid-infrared spectral region.</description>

      <title>The effect of doping layers position on the heterojunction sharpness in (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effect of doped layer placed in structures with indirect band-gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots (QDs) on heterointerface sharpness is investigated. We demonstrate that growth of n (p) doped layer below QDs sheet leads to pronounced deceleration (acceleration) for dynamics of exciton recombination (which is very sensitive to heterointeface structure in these QDs) in compare with the undoped structure. Opposite, the placing of the same doped layers above the QDs sheet does not effect on the exciton recombination dynamic at all. The experimental data are explained by increase (decrease) charged vacancy formation rate in the cation sublattice, that result in QD/matrix interface bluring (sharping), with the increases in the electron (hole) concentration at this heterointerface formation. The thicknesses of the diffuse layer on QD/matrix heterointerface estimated is in range from 0 up to 5 in the lattice constant depending on doped layer placing.</description>

      <title>Magnetism from Conductors, and Enhanced Non-Linear Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that microstructures built from non-magnetic conducting sheets exhibit an effective magnetic permeability, /mu_meff, which can be tuned to values not accessible in naturally occurring materials, including large imaginary components of /mu_meff. The microstructure is on a scale much less than the wavelength of radiation, is not resolved by incident microwaves, and uses a very low density of metal so that structures can be extremely lightweight. Most of the structures are resonant due to internal capacitance and inductance, and resonant enhancement combined with compression of electrical energy into a very small volume greatly enhances the energy density at critical locations in the structure, easily by factors of a million and possibly by much more. Weakly non-linear materials placed at these critical locations will show greatly enhanced effects raising the possibility of manufacturing active structures whose properties can be switched at will between many states</description>

      <title>Projective symmetries of three-dimensional TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory has various projective characteristics which are captured by what are called anomalies. This paper explores this idea in the context of fully-extended three-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs).
  Given a three-dimensional TQFT (valued in the Morita 3-category of fusion categories), the anomaly identified herein is an obstruction to gauging a naturally occurring orthogonal group of symmetries. In other words, the classical symmetry group almost acts: There is a lack of coherence at the top level. This lack of coherence is captured by a "higher (central) extension" of the orthogonal group, obtained via a modification of the obstruction theory of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik-Meir [ENO10]. This extension tautologically acts on the given TQFT/fusion category, and this precisely classifies a projective (equivalently anomalous) TQFT. We explain the sense in which this is an analogue of the classical spin representation. This is an instance of a phenomenon emphasized by Freed [Fre23]: Quantum theory is projective.
  We also establish a general relationship between the language of projectivity/anomalies and the language of topological symmetries. We also identify a universal anomaly associated with any theory which is appropriately "simple".</description>

      <title>Protected chaos in a topological lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The erratic nature of chaotic behavior is thought to erode the stability of periodic behavior, including topological oscillations. However, we discover that in the presence of chaos, non-trivial topology not only endures but also provides robust protection to chaotic dynamics within a topological lattice hosting non-linear oscillators. Despite the difficulty in defining topological invariants in non-linear settings, non-trivial topological robustness still persists in the parametric state of chaotic boundary oscillations. We demonstrate this interplay between chaos and topology by incorporating chaotic Chua's circuits into a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. By extrapolating from the linear limit to deep into the non-linear regime, we find that distinctive correlations in the bulk and edge scroll dynamics effectively capture the topological origin of the protected chaos. Our findings suggest that topologically protected chaos can be robustly achieved across a broad spectrum of periodically-driven systems, thereby offering new avenues for the design of resilient and adaptable non-linear networks.</description>
