      <title>A Novel Approach for Flexible Body Dynamics Computation via Synthesizing Incremental Motions in Reconfigured Inertial Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach is presented for computing flexible body dynamics based on conventional structural dynamics models. This approach innovatively captures the rigid body motion component embedded within a flexible body's movement, generates and synthesizes single-step responses in a sequence of reconfigured inertial frames that follow the rigid body motion. By doing so, it effectively bypasses the complexities associated with modeling flexibilities and formulating highly nonlinear coupled motion equations. In addition to improving predictive accuracy, this approach offers valuable insights into the interaction between rigid body motion and structural vibration. By bridging these two aspects, it advances the understanding of flexible body dynamics and delivers a precise, efficient simulation framework for a wide range of engineering applications.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Finite Difference-Based PML Technique for Acoustic Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acoustic scattering problem is modeled by the exterior Helmholtz equation, which is challenging to solve due to both the unboundedness of the domain and the high dispersion error, known as the pollution effect. We develop high-order compact finite difference methods (FDMs) in polar coordinates to numerically solve the problem with multiple arbitrarily shaped scatterers. The unbounded domain is effectively truncated and compressed via perfectly matched layers (PMLs), while the pollution effect is handled by the high order of our method and a novel pollution minimization technique. This technique is easy to implement, rigorously proven to be effective and shows superior performance in our numerous numerical results. The FDMs we propose in regular polar coordinates achieve fourth consistency order. Yet, combined with exponential stretching and mesh refinement, we can reach sixth consistency order by slightly enlarging the stencil at certain locations. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed FDMs are effective and robust under various wavenumbers, PML layer thickness and shapes of scatterers.</description>

      <title>A Continuum Macro-Model for Bistable Periodic Auxetic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A macro-constitutive model for the deformation response of periodic rotating bistable auxetic surfaces is developed. Focus is placed on isotropic surfaces made of bistable hexagonal cells composed of six triangular units with two stable equilibrium states. Adopting a variational formulation, the effective stress-strain response is derived from a free energy function expressed in terms of the invariants of the logarithmic strain. A regularization of the governing equations via a gradient-enhanced first invariant of the logarithmic strain is introduced since the double-well nature of the free energy may result in mathematical ill-posedness and related numerical artifacts, such as mesh sensitivity. Despite this regularization, the numerical scheme may still suffer from divergence issues due to the highly non-linear material behavior. To enhance numerical stability, an artificial material rate-dependency is additionally introduced. Although it does not guarantee solution uniqueness or eliminate mesh sensitivity, it is conjectured to assist the numerical scheme in overcoming snap-backs caused by local non-proportional loading induced by transition fronts. The model is implemented using membrane/shell structural elements and plane stress continuum ones within the ABAQUS finite element suite. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation and its implementation.</description>

      <title>Auto-Adaptive PINNs with Applications to Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive sampling method for the training of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) which allows for sampling based on an arbitrary problem-specific heuristic which may depend on the network and its gradients. In particular we focus our analysis on the Allen-Cahn equations, attempting to accurately resolve the characteristic interfacial regions using a PINN without any post-hoc resampling. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of these methods over residual-adaptive frameworks.</description>

      <title>On the Superconvergence of ESFR Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) method provides an efficient and flexible framework to devise high-order linearly stable numerical schemes which can achieve high levels of accuracy on unstructured grids. While superconvergent properties of ESFR schemes have been observed in numerical experiments, no formal proof of this behavior has been reported in the literature. In this work, we attempt to address this by providing a simple derivation for the superconvergence of the dispersion-dissipation error of ESFR schemes for the linear advection problem when using an upwind numerical flux. We show that the superconvergence of ESFR schemes essentially relies on the capacity of the latter to generate superconvergent rational approximants of the exponential function, which is reminiscent of well-known theoretical results for superconvergence of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. We also demonstrate that the drops in order of accuracy which are observed in numerical experiments as the ESFR scalar $c$ is increased are caused by both a modification of the structure of these rational approximants and a change in the multiplicity of the physical eigenvalue of the schemes as $c \to \infty$. Finally, our theoretical results are successfully validated against numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>SymMaP: Improving Computational Efficiency in Linear Solvers through Symbolic Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix preconditioning is a critical technique to accelerate the solution of linear systems, where performance heavily depends on the selection of preconditioning parameters. Traditional parameter selection approaches often define fixed constants for specific scenarios. However, they rely on domain expertise and fail to consider the instance-wise features for individual problems, limiting their performance. In contrast, machine learning (ML) approaches, though promising, are hindered by high inference costs and limited interpretability. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we propose a symbolic discovery framework-namely, Symbolic Matrix Preconditioning (SymMaP)-to learn efficient symbolic expressions for preconditioning parameters. Specifically, we employ a neural network to search the high-dimensional discrete space for expressions that can accurately predict the optimal parameters. The learned expression allows for high inference efficiency and excellent interpretability (expressed in concise symbolic formulas), making it simple and reliable for deployment. Experimental results show that SymMaP consistently outperforms traditional strategies across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Nullspace-preserving high-index saddle dynamics method for degenerate multiple solution problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the nullspace-preserving high-index saddle dynamics (NPHiSD) method for degenerating multiple solution systems in constrained and unconstrained settings. The NPHiSD efficiently locates high-index saddle points and provides parent states for downward searches of lower-index saddles, thereby constructing the solution landscape systematically. The NPHiSD method searches along multiple efficient ascent directions by excluding the nullspace, which is the key for upward searches in degenerate problems. To reduce the cost of frequent nullspace updates, the search is divided into segments, within which the ascent directions remain orthogonal to the nullspace of the initial state of each segment. A sufficient and necessary condition for characterizing the segment that admits efficient ascent directions is proved. Extensive numerical experiments for typical problems such as Lifshitz-Petrich, Gross-Pitaevskii, and Lennard-Jones models are performed to show the universality and effectiveness of the NPHiSD method.</description>

      <title>Approximation of invariant measures for random lattice reversible Selkov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the numerical approximation of random lattice reversible Selkov systems. It establishes the existence of numerical invariant measures for random models with nonlinear noise, using the backward Euler-Maruyama (BEM) scheme for time discretization. The study examines both infinite dimensional discrete random models and their corresponding finite dimensional truncations. A classical path convergence technique is employed to demonstrate the convergence of the invariant measures of the BEM scheme to those of the random lattice reversible Selkov systems. As the discrete time step size approaches zero, the invariant measure of the random lattice reversible Selkov systems can be approximated by the numerical invariant measure of the finite dimensional truncated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive parameter-robust quasi-optimal error estimates for mixed finite element methods for the nonlinear Darcy--Forchheimer equations with mixed boundary conditions. Using the framework of operator preconditioning, we also design efficient block preconditioners for the linearised system, that exhibit robustness with respect to the coefficients that modulate permeability and inertia of the system. The properties of the formulation (parameter and mesh-size independence of the convergence rates) are illustrated by means of several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Enforcing boundary conditions for physics-informed neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning based methods like physics-informed neural networks and physics-informed neural operators are becoming increasingly adept at solving even complex systems of partial differential equations. Boundary conditions can be enforced either weakly by penalizing deviations in the loss function or strongly by training a solution structure that inherently matches the prescribed values and derivatives. The former approach is easy to implement but the latter can provide benefits with respect to accuracy and training times. However, previous approaches to strongly enforcing Neumann or Robin boundary conditions require a domain with a fully $C^1$ boundary and, as we demonstrate, can lead to instability if those boundary conditions are posed on a segment of the boundary that is piecewise $C^1$ but only $C^0$ globally. We introduce a generalization of the approach by Sukumar \&amp; Srivastava (doi: 10.1016/j.cma.2021.114333), and a new approach based on orthogonal projections that overcome this limitation. The performance of these new techniques is compared against weakly and semi-weakly enforced boundary conditions for the scalar Darcy flow equation and the stationary Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Truncated Single-Sample Estimators for Scalable Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many large-scale stochastic optimization algorithms involve repeated solutions of linear systems or evaluations of log-determinants. In these regimes, computing exact solutions is often unnecessary; it is more computationally efficient to construct unbiased stochastic estimators with controlled variance. However, classical iterative solvers incur truncation bias, whereas unbiased Krylov-based estimators typically exhibit high variance and numerical instability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the Preconditioned Truncated Single-Sample (PTSS) estimators--a family of stochastic Krylov methods that integrate preconditioning with truncated Lanczos iterations. PTSS yields low-variance, stable estimators for linear system solutions, log-determinants, and their derivatives. We establish theoretical results on their mean, variance, and concentration properties, explicitly quantifying the variance reduction induced by preconditioning. Numerical experiments confirm that PTSS achieves superior stability and variance control compared with existing unbiased and biased alternatives, providing an efficient framework for stochastic optimization.</description>

      <title>On a robust inf-sup condition for the Stokes problem in slender domains - with application to preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a norm on the pressure variable in the Stokes equation that allows us to prove a continuous inf-sup condition with a constant independent of the domain's aspect ratio. This is in contrast to the standard inf-sup constant, which breaks down as the aspect ratio increases. We further apply our result to construct robust operator preconditioners for the Stokes problem in slender domains. Several numerical examples illustrate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct families of polynomials defined by recurrence relations related to mean-zero random walks. We show these families of polynomials can be used to approximate $z^n$ by a polynomial of degree $\sim \sqrt{n}$ in associated radially convex domains in the complex plane. Moreover, we show that the constructed families of polynomials have a useful rapid growth property and a connection to Faber polynomials. Applications to iterative linear algebra are presented, including the development of arbitrary-order dynamic momentum power iteration methods suitable for classes of non-symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Reduced Basis Approach for Convection-Diffusion Equations with Non-Linear Boundary Reaction Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at an efficient strategy to solve drift-diffusion problems with non-linear boundary conditions as they appear, e.g., in heterogeneous catalysis. Since the non-linearity only involves the degrees of freedom along (a part of) the boundary, a reduced basis ansatz is suggested that computes discrete Green's-like functions for the present drift-diffusion operator such that the global non-linear problem reduces to a smaller non-linear problem for a boundary method. The computed basis functions are completely independent of the non-linearities. Thus, they can be reused for problems with the same differential operator and geometry. Corresponding scenarios might be inverse problems in heterogeneous catalysis but also modeling the effect of different catalysts in the same reaction chamber. The strategy is explained for a mass-conservative finite volume method and demonstrated on a simple numerical example for catalytic CO oxidation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant measures the efficiency of a Markov chain in traversing its states. We investigate whether structure-preserving perturbations to the transition probabilities of a reversible Markov chain can improve its connectivity while maintaining a fixed stationary distribution. Although the minimum achievable value for Kemeny's constant can be estimated, the required perturbations may be infeasible. We reformulate the problem as an optimization task, focusing on solution existence and efficient algorithms, with an emphasis to the problem of minimizing Kemeny's constant under sparsity constraints.</description>

      <title>Score-based constrained generative modeling via Langevin diffusions with boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) achieve impressive performance in sampling from unknown distributions, but often fail to satisfy underlying constraints. We propose a constrained generative model using kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics with specular reflection of velocity on the boundary defining constraints. This results in piecewise continuously differentiable noising and denoising process where the latter is characterized by a time-reversed dynamics restricted to a domain with boundary due to specular boundary condition. In addition, we also contribute to existing reflected SDEs based constrained generative models, where the stochastic dynamics is restricted through an abstract local time term. By presenting efficient numerical samplers which converge with optimal rate in terms of discretizations step, we provide a comprehensive comparison of models based on confined (specularly reflected kinetic) Langevin diffusion with models based on reflected diffusion with local time.</description>

      <title>STNet: Spectral Transformation Network for Solving Operator Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks. These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration, STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally, our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Variable Projected Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Generalized Lasso Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce variable projected augmented Lagrangian (VPAL) methods for solving generalized nonlinear Lasso problems with improved speed and accuracy. By eliminating the nonsmooth variable via soft-thresholding, VPAL transforms the problem into a smooth reduced formulation. For linear models, we develop a preconditioned variant that mimics Newton-type updates and yields significant acceleration. We prove convergence guarantees for both standard and preconditioned VPAL under mild assumptions and show that variable projection leads to sharper convergence and higher solution quality. The method seamlessly extends to nonlinear inverse problems, where it outperforms traditional approaches in applications such as phase retrieval and contrast enhanced MRI (LIP-CAR). Across tasks including deblurring, inpainting, and sparse-view tomography, VPAL consistently delivers state-of-the-art reconstructions, positioning variable projection as a powerful tool for modern large-scale inverse problems.</description>

      <title>EddyFormer: Accelerated Neural Simulations of Three-Dimensional Turbulence at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM) architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features. We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows, EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.</description>

      <title>A comparison between joint and dual UKF implementations for state estimation and leak localization in water distribution networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sustainability of modern cities highly depends on efficient water distribution management, including effective pressure control and leak detection and localization. Accurate information about the network hydraulic state is therefore essential. This article presents a comparison between two data-driven state estimation methods based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), fusing pressure, demand and flow data for head and flow estimation. One approach uses a joint state vector with a single estimator, while the other uses a dual-estimator scheme. We analyse their main characteristics, discussing differences, advantages and limitations, and compare them theoretically in terms of accuracy and complexity. Finally, we show several estimation results for the L-TOWN benchmark, allowing to discuss their properties in a real implementation.</description>

      <title>A Two-step Krasnosel'skii-Mann Algorithm with Adaptive Momentum and Its Applications to Image Denoising and Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Two-step Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) Algorithm (TKMA) with adaptive momentum for solving convex optimization problems arising in image processing. Such optimization problems can often be reformulated as fixed-point problems for certain operators, which are then solved using iterative methods based on the same operator, including the KM iteration, to ultimately obtain the solution to the original optimization problem. Prior to developing TKMA, we first introduce a KM iteration enhanced with adaptive momentum, derived from geometric properties of an averaged nonexpansive operator T, KM acceleration technique, and information from the composite operator T^2. The proposed TKMA is constructed as a convex combination of this adaptive-momentum KM iteration and the Picard iteration of T^2. We establish the convergence of the sequence generated by TKMA to a fixed point of T. Moreover, under specific assumptions on the adaptive momentum parameters, we prove that the algorithm achieves an o(1/k^{1/2}) convergence rate in terms of the distance between successive iterates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TKMA outperforms the FPPA, PGA, Fast KM algorithm, and Halpern algorithm on tasks such as image denoising and low-rank matrix completion.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms enabling optimization and deep learning for photoacoustic tomography in a circular detection geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several other coupled-physics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms. Such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional. In addition, novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to further improve such optimization approaches. All such methods require multiple applications of the operator defining the forward problem, and of its adjoint. In this paper, we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators, applicable in the circular acquisition geometry. For an $(n \times n)$ image, our algorithms compute these operators in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ floating point operations. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical simulations, where they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction techniques: classic variational methods, such as non-negative least squares and total variation regularized least squares, as well as deep learning methods, such as learned primal dual. A Python implementation of our algorithms and computational examples is available to the general public.</description>

      <title>High-order integration on regular triangulated manifolds reaches super-algebraic approximation rates through cubical re-parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for deriving high-order volume elements (HOVE) designed for the integration of scalar functions over regular embedded manifolds. For constructing HOVE we introduce square-squeezing --a homeomorphic multilinear hypercube-simplex transformation reparametrizing an initial flat triangulation of the manifold to a cubical mesh. By employing square-squeezing, we approximate the integrand and the volume element for each hypercube domain of the reparameterized mesh through interpolation in Chebyshev-Lobatto grids. This strategy circumvents the Runge phenomenon, replacing the initial integral with a closed-form expression that can be precisely computed by high-order quadratures.
  We prove novel bounds of the integration error in terms of the $r^\text{th}$-order total variation of the integrand and the surface parameterization, predicting high algebraic approximation rates that scale solely with the interpolation degree and not, as is common, with the average simplex size. For smooth integrals whose total variation is constantly bounded with increasing $r$, the estimates prove the integration error to decrease even exponentially, while mesh refinements are limited to achieve algebraic rates. The resulting approximation power is demonstrated in several numerical experiments, particularly showcasing $p$-refinements to overcome the limitations of $h$-refinements for highly varying smooth integrals.</description>

      <title>On a randomized small-block Lanczos method for large-scale null space computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the null space of a large sparse matrix $A$ is a challenging computational problem, especially if the nullity -- the dimension of the null space -- is not small. When applying a block Lanczos method to $A^\mathsf{T} A$ for this purpose, conventional wisdom suggests to use a block size $d$ that is not smaller than the nullity. In this work, we show how randomness can be utilized to allow for smaller $d$ without sacrificing convergence or reliability. Even $d = 1$, corresponding to the standard single-vector Lanczos method, becomes a safe choice. This is achieved by using a small random diagonal perturbation, which moves the zero eigenvalues of $A^\mathsf{T} A$ away from each other, and a random initial guess. We analyze the effect of the perturbation on the attainable quality of the null space and derive convergence results that establish robust convergence for $d=1$. As demonstrated by our numerical experiments, a smaller block size combined with restarting and partial reorthogonalization results in reduced memory requirements and computational effort. It also allows for the incremental computation of the null space, without requiring a priori knowledge of the nullity. Our algorithm is best suited for situations when the nullity of $A$ is moderate.</description>

      <title>A priori and a posteriori error estimates of a $\mathcal C^0$-in-time method for the wave equation in second order formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish fully-discrete a priori and semi-discrete in time a posteriori error estimates for a discontinuous-continuous Galerkin discretization of the wave equation in second order formulation; the resulting method is a Petrov-Galerkin scheme based on piecewise and piecewise continuous polynomial in time test and trial spaces, respectively. Crucial tools in the a priori analysis for the fully-discrete formulation are the design of suitable projection and interpolation operators extending those used in the parabolic setting, and stability estimates based on a nonstandard choice of the test function; a priori estimates are shown, which are measured in $L^\infty$-type norms in time. For the semi-discrete in time formulation, we exhibit reliable a posteriori error estimates for the error measured in the $L^\infty(L^2)$ norm with fully explicit constants; to this aim, we design a reconstruction operator into $\mathcal C^1$ piecewise polynomials over the time grid with optimal approximation properties in terms of the polynomial degree distribution and the time steps. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Boundary-preserving weak approximation for some semilinear stochastic partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a boundary-preserving numerical scheme for the weak approximation for some stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with bounded state-space. We impose regularity assumptions on the drift and diffusion coefficients only locally on the state-space. In particular, the drift and diffusion coefficients may be non-globally Lipschitz continuous and superlinearly growing. The scheme consists of a finite difference discretisation in space and a Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration in time. The proposed scheme converges in the weak sense of order $1/4$ in time and of order $1/2$ in space, for globally Lipschitz continuous test functions. We prove the weak convergence order in time by proving strong convergence towards a strong solution driven by a different noise process. The convergence order in space follows from known results. The boundary-preserving property is ensured by the use of Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed Lie--Trotter-Exact (LTE) scheme compared to existing schemes for SPDEs.</description>

Abstract: We propose a linear algebraic framework for performing density estimation. It consists of three simple steps: convolving the empirical distribution with certain smoothing kernels to remove the exponentially large variance; compressing the empirical distribution after convolution as a tensor train, with efficient tensor decomposition algorithms; and finally, applying a deconvolution step to recover the estimated density from such tensor-train representation. Numerical results demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

Abstract: A novel structure-preserving numerical method to solve random hyperbolic systems of conservation laws is presented. The method uses a concept of generalized, measure-valued solutions to random conservation laws. This yields a linear partial differential equation with respect to the Young measure and allows to compute the approximation based on linear programming problems. We analyze structure-preserving properties of the derived numerical method and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. We numerically demonstrate the approach on the one-dimensional Burgers and isentropic Euler equations and compare with stochastic collocation. In addition, we introduce a discontinuous-flux test in which different entropies used in the linear-program objective select different weak entropy solutions, and we report the corresponding changes in the moments and supports of the Young measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourier transform-based methods enable accurate, dispersion-free simulations of time-domain scattering problems by evaluating solutions to the Helmholtz equation at a discrete set of frequencies sufficient to approximate the inverse Fourier transform. However, in the case of scattering by trapping obstacles, the Helmholtz solution exhibits nearly-real complex resonances -- which significantly slows the convergence of numerical inverse transform. To address this difficulty this paper introduces a frequency-domain singularity subtraction technique that regularizes the integrand of the inverse transform and efficiently computes the singularity contribution via a combination of a straightforward and inexpensive numerical technique together with a large-time asymptotic expansion. Crucially, all relevant complex resonances and their residues are determined via rational approximation of integral equation solutions at real frequencies. An adaptive algorithm is employed to ensure that all relevant complex resonances are properly identified.</description>

      <title>The pollution effect for FEM approximations of the Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximation properties of solutions to the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) in finite element spaces. Special attention is given to how the errors are influenced by coupling the mesh size $h$ and the polynomial degree $p$ of the finite element space to the size of the so-called Ginzburg-Landau material parameter $\kappa$. As observed in previous works, the finite element approximations to the GLE are suffering from a numerical pollution effect, that is, the best-approximation error in the finite element space converges under mild coupling conditions between $h$ and $\kappa$, whereas the actual finite element solutions possess poor accuracy in a large pre-asymptotic regime which depends on $\kappa$. In this paper, we provide a new error analysis that allows us to quantify the pre-asymptotic regime and the corresponding pollution effect in terms of explicit resolution conditions. In particular, we are able to prove that higher polynomial degrees reduce the pollution effect, i.e., the accuracy of the best-approximation is achieved under relaxed conditions for the mesh size. We provide both error estimates in the $H^1$- and the $L^2$-norm and we illustrate our findings with numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We consider the scalar wave equation with power nonlinearity in n+1 dimensions. Unlike most previous numerical studies, we go beyond the radial case and do not assume any symmetries for n=3, and we only impose an SO(n-1) symmetry in higher dimensions. Our method is based on a hyperboloidal foliation of Minkowski spacetime and conformal compactification. We focus on the late-time power-law decay (tails) of the solutions and compute decay exponents for different spherical harmonic modes, for subcritical, critical and supercritical, focusing and defocusing nonlinear wave equations.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability of one-dimensional linear lattice Boltzmann schemes for scalar hyperbolic equations with respect to boundary data. Our approach is based on the original raw algorithm on several unknowns, thereby avoiding the need for a transformation into an equivalent scalar formulation-a challenging process in presence of boundaries. To address different behaviors exhibited by the numerical scheme, we introduce appropriate notions of strong stability. They account for the potential absence of a continuous extension of the stable vector bundle associated with the bulk scheme on the unit circle for certain components. Rather than developing a general theory, complicated by the fact that discrete boundaries in lattice Boltzmann schemes are inherently characteristic, we focus on strong stability-instability for methods whose characteristic equations have stencils of breadth one to the left. In this context, we study three representative schemes. These are endowed with various boundary conditions drawn from the literature, and our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An Augmented Lagrangian Method-Based Framework in the Adjoint Space for Sparse Reconstruction of Acoustic Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a semismooth Newton-based augmented Lagrangian framework for reconstructing sparse sources in inverse acoustic scattering problems. Rather than working in the unknown source space, our semismooth Newton updates operate in the measurement (adjoint) space, which is especially efficient when the number of measurements is much smaller than the discretized source dimension. The source is then recovered via Fenchel-Rockafellar duality. Our approach substantially accelerates computation and reduces costs. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Reduced dynamics for models of pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to analyze the long-term behavior of reaction-diffusion systems arising in two-species chemical models and to identify the minimal set of modes that determine their dynamics. The models considered include, as particular cases, the Brusselator, the Gray--Scott, and the Glycolysis models. These systems are described by coupled reaction-diffusion equations and admit a finite-dimensional representation based on a limited number of spatial Fourier modes that capture their essential reduced dynamics. The concept of determining modes, introduced in this context, is closely related to other approaches that seek finite-dimensional representations of infinite-dimensional dynamics, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and the construction of Approximate Inertial Manifolds. We prove that the dynamics of the system can be completely characterized by a finite number of low modes, since all higher modes are asymptotically determined by them, thus providing an analytical foundation for reduced dynamics in models of pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Bicausal optimal transport for SDEs with irregular coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve constrained optimal transport problems in which the marginal laws are given by the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. We show that the so-called synchronous coupling is optimal among bicausal couplings, that is couplings that respect the flow of information encoded in the stochastic processes. Our results provide a method to numerically compute the adapted Wasserstein distance between laws of SDEs with irregular coefficients. We show that this can be applied to quantifying model uncertainty in stochastic optimisation problems. Moreover, we introduce a transformation-based semi-implicit numerical scheme and establish the first strong convergence result for SDEs with exponentially growing and discontinuous drift.</description>

      <title>DeltaPhi: Physical States Residual Learning for Neural Operators in Data-Limited PDE Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited availability of high-quality training data poses a major obstacle in data-driven PDE solving, where expensive data collection and resolution constraints severely impact the ability of neural operator networks to learn and generalize the underlying physical system. To address this challenge, we propose DeltaPhi, a novel learning framework that transforms the PDE solving task from learning direct input-output mappings to learning the residuals between similar physical states, a fundamentally different approach to neural operator learning. This reformulation provides implicit data augmentation by exploiting the inherent stability of physical systems where closer initial states lead to closer evolution trajectories. DeltaPhi is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with existing neural operators to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent and significant improvements across diverse physical systems including regular and irregular domains, different neural architectures, multiple training data amount, and cross-resolution scenarios, confirming its effectiveness as a general enhancement for neural operators in data-limited PDE solving.</description>

      <title>Seeding neural network quantum states with tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states while increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.</description>
