      <title>Revisiting the Structure of Trend Premia: When Diversification Hides Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has emphasized the diversification benefits of combining trend signals across multiple horizons, with the medium-term window-typically six months to one year-long viewed as the "sweet spot" of trend-following. This paper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically across horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the optimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common practice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally from all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and empirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the asset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying Bayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate dynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band contributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and long-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe ratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then rationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that the medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The resulting "barbell" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures most of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges the common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and suggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary redundancy in trend premia.</description>

      <title>Building Trust in Illiquid Markets: an AI-Powered Replication of Private Equity Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to growing demand for resilient and transparent financial instruments, we introduce a novel framework for replicating private equity (PE) performance using liquid, AI-enhanced strategies. Despite historically delivering robust returns, private equity's inherent illiquidity and lack of transparency raise significant concerns regarding investor trust and systemic stability, particularly in periods of heightened market volatility. Our method uses advanced graphical models to decode liquid PE proxies and incorporates asymmetric risk adjustments that emulate private equity's unique performance dynamics. The result is a liquid, scalable solution that aligns closely with traditional quarterly PE benchmarks like Cambridge Associates and Preqin. This approach enhances portfolio resilience and contributes to the ongoing discourse on safe asset innovation, supporting market stability and investor confidence.</description>

      <title>Stochastic PDEs and Quantitative Finance: The Black-Scholes-Merton Model of Options Pricing and Riskless Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1919</link>
      <description>arXiv:1212.1919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations can be used to construct predictive models of a diverse set of real-world phenomena like heat transfer, predator-prey interactions, and missile tracking. In our work, we explore one particular application of stochastic differential equations, the Black-Scholes-Merton model, which can be used to predict the prices of financial derivatives and maintain a riskless, hedged position in the stock market. This paper is intended to provide the reader with a history, derivation, and implementation of the canonical model as well as an improved trading strategy that better handles arbitrage opportunities in high-volatility markets. Our attempted improvements may be broken into two components: an implementation of 24-hour, worldwide trading designed to create a continuous trading scenario and the use of the Student's t-distribution (with two degrees of freedom) in evaluating the Black-Scholes equations.</description>
