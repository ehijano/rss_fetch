      <title>Irreversible swap algorithms for soft sphere glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend to soft repulsive interaction potentials a recently proposed irreversible swap algorithm originally designed for polydisperse hard spheres. The original algorithm performs rejection-free, irreversible, collective swap moves. We show that event-driven cluster updates of particle diameters can also be performed in continuous potentials by introducing a factorised Metropolis probability. However, the Metropolis factorisation needed to deal with continuous potentials decreases the efficiency of the algorithm and mitigates the benefits of breaking detailed balance. This leads us to propose another irreversible swap algorithm using the standard Metropolis probability that accelerates the relaxation of soft sphere glasses at low temperatures, compared to the original swap algorithm. We apply these efficient swap algorithms to produce very stable inherent structures with vibrational density of states lacking the quasi-localised excitations observed in conventional glasses.</description>

      <title>Emergent scales and spatial correlations at the yielding transition of glassy materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassy materials yield under large external mechanical solicitations. Under oscillatory shear, yielding shows a well-known rheological fingerprint, common to samples with widely different microstructures. At the microscale, this corresponds to a transition between slow, solid-like dynamics and faster liquid-like dynamics, which can coexist at yielding in a finite range of strain amplitudes. Here, we capture this phenomenology in a lattice model with two main parameters: glassiness and disorder, describing the average coupling between adjacent lattice sites, and their variance, respectively. In absence of disorder, our model yields a law of correspondent states equivalent to trajectories on a cusp catastrophe manifold, a well-known class of problems including equilibrium liquid-vapour phase transitions. Introducing a finite disorder in our model entails a qualitative change, to a continuous and rounded transition, whose extent is controlled by the magnitude of the disorder. We show that a spatial correlation length $\xi$ emerges spontaneously from the coupling between disorder and bifurcating dynamics. With vanishing disorder, $\xi$ diverges and yielding becomes discontinuous, suggesting that the abruptness of yielding can be rationalized in terms of a lengthscale of dynamic heterogeneities.</description>

      <title>Butterfly Patterns for Stretched Inhomogeneous Gel Networks using Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of inhomogeneous gel networks were performed to investigate abnormal butterfly patterns in two-dimensional scattering. The networks were diamond lattice-based with distributions in the number of beads between the crosslink points. Remarkably, the results confirm that the abnormal butterfly pattern orig-inates from stronger inhomogeneity. For the examined systems, the range of scattering wavevector q for the normal butterfly pattern was markedly different from those for the abnormal butterfly patterns. The findings address an essential aspect of the discrepancy between theorical prediction and experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Polymer Association Behaviors in Solvents Using a Coarse-Grained Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The associative interaction, such as hydrogen bonding, can bring about versatile functionalities to polymer systems, which has been investigated by tremendous researches, but the fundamental understanding on association process is still lacking. In this study, a reaction-controlled association model is proposed to delve into the polymer association activities in solvents, which is proved to obey the principle of thermodynamics. Additionally, associative polymer chain configurational bias method is developed to improve sampling efficiency, demonstrating a significantly faster relaxation process. First, we set non-bonded interactions to be zero, and only keep the chain connectivity and association. It is found that the association process intrinsically follows Bernoulli process by comparing the simulation results and analytic results. Next, we include non-bonded interactions into the simulation to examine its effects. It emerged that the excluded volume effect and solvents immiscibility effects can result in inhomogeneous associating probability distribution along the chain contour, in contrast to the homogeneity observed in ideal systems, thereby shifting from the binomial distribution to Poisson binomial distribution. At last, the study is extended to cooperative association systems. The incorporation of cooperative association can lead to the coexistence of coil and globule state at the transition point, verified by the potential of mean force calculation. Finally, a mathematical model is proposed, illustrating the changes in statistical weight induced by sequence enthalpy bias, which is the consequence of cooperative behaviors.</description>

      <title>Hopper flows of dense suspensions: a 2D microfluidic model system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows of particles through bottlenecks are ubiquitous in nature and industry, involving both dry granular materials and suspensions. However, practical limitations of conventional experimental setups hinder the full understanding of these flows in confined geometries. Here, we present a microfluidic setup to investigate experimentally the flow of dense suspensions in a two-dimensional hopper channel. Particles with controlled properties are in-situ fabricated with a photolithographic projection method and compacted at the channel constriction using a Quake valve. The setup is characterized by examining the flow of a dense suspension of hard, monodisperse disks through constrictions of varying widths. We demonstrate that the microfluidic hopper discharges particles at constant rate, resulting from the channel resistance being dominated by the presence of densely packed particles within the tapered section of the hopper. Under imposed flow rate the discharge remains independent of particle and orifice sizes, whereas it exhibits a Beverloo-like scaling under pressure-imposed conditions. Additionally, we show that the statistics of clog formation in our microfluidic hopper follow the same stochastic laws as reported in other systems. Finally, we show how the versatility of our microfluidic model system can be used to investigate the outflow and clogging of suspensions of more complex particles.</description>

      <title>Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To learn such models from data, a common approach involves decomposing the SDE into a linear combination of basis functions. However, this can induce overfitting due to the proliferation of parameters. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method that removes superfluous parameters from SDE models by combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory. We benchmark it against existing methods and show that it reliably selects the exact minimal models from large libraries of functions, even with a low sampling rate or measurement error. We show that it extends to stochastic partial differential equations and demonstrate applications to the inference of ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Motorized Chromosome Models of Mitosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During mitosis, near-spherical chromosomes reconfigure into rod-like structures to ensure their accurate segregation to daughter cells. We explore here, the interplay between the nonequilibrium activity of molecular motors in determining the chromosomal organization in mitosis and its characteristic symmetry-breaking events. We present a hybrid motorized chromosome model that highlights the distinct roles of condensin I and II in shaping mitotic chromosomes. Guided by experimental observations, the simulations suggest that condensin II facilitates large-scale scaffold formation, while condensin I is paramount in local helical loop arrangement. Together, these two distinct grappling motors establish the hierarchical helical structure characteristic of mitotic chromosomes, which exhibit striking local and, sometimes global, chirality and contribute to the robust mechanical properties of mitotic chromosomes. Accompanying the emergence of rigidity, the model provides mechanisms of forming defects, including perversions and entanglements, and shows how these may be partially resolved through condensin activity and topoisomerase action. This framework bridges coarse-grained energy landscape models of chromosome dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, advancing the understanding of chromosome organization during cell division and beyond.</description>

      <title>A rigid origami elliptic-hyperbolic vertex duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of rigid origami concerns the folding of stiff, inelastic plates of material along crease lines that act like hinges and form a straight-line planar graph, called the crease pattern of the origami. Crease pattern vertices in the interior of the folded material and that are adjacent to four crease lines, i.e. degree-4 vertices, have a single degree of freedom and can be chained together to make flexible polyhedral surfaces. Degree-4 vertices that can fold to a completely flat state have folding kinematics that are very well-understood, and thus they have been used in many engineering and physics applications. However, degree-4 vertices that are not flat-foldable or not folded from flat paper so that the vertex forms either an elliptic or hyperbolic cone, have folding angles at the creases that follow more complicated kinematic equations. In this work we present a new duality between general degree-4 rigid origami vertices, where dual vertices come in elliptic-hyperbolic pairs that have essentially equivalent kinematics. This reveals a mathematical structure in the space of degree-4 rigid origami vertices that can be leveraged in applications, for example in the construction of flexible 3D structures that possess metamaterial properties.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Cassie-Baxter Model: New Insights for Predicting Imbibition in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of liquid imbibition in a single pore with spatially varying wettability. Starting from the Lucas-Washburn equation, we derive analytical solutions for the imbibition time (crossing time) in systems where wettability alternates between two materials. For ordered arrangements, we demonstrate that the imbibition speed depends non-trivially on the spatial distribution, with the "more hydrophobic-first" configuration being optimal. For disordered systems, where segment lengths follow a Gaussian distribution, we show that the classical Cassie-Baxter contact angle, originally derived for static wetting, fails to predict the dynamics of capillary-driven flow. To address this, we propose a new weighted harmonic averaging method for the contact angle, which accurately describes the viscous crossing time in such heterogeneous systems. Our findings reveal fundamental insights into the role of wettability heterogeneity in capillary-driven flow, offering a basis for understanding imbibition dynamics in complex heterogeneous systems. The research data and the software supporting this study are openly available at DOI:10.5281/zenodo.14537452.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Hard and Soft Nanoparticle-Protein Corona with Multilayer Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) in contact with biological fluid adsorb biomolecules into a corona. This corona comprises proteins that strongly bind to the NP (hard corona) and loosely bound proteins (soft corona) that dynamically exchange with the surrounding solution. While the kinetics of hard corona formation is relatively well understood, thanks to experiments and robust simulation models, the experimental characterization and simulation of the soft corona present a more significant challenge. Here, we review the current state of the art in soft corona characterization and introduce a novel open-source computational model to simulate its dynamic behavior, for which we provide the documentation. We focus on the case of transferrin (Tf) interacting with polystyrene NPs as an illustrative example, demonstrating how this model captures the complexities of the soft corona and offers deeper insights into its structure and behavior. We show that the soft corona is dominated by a glassy evolution that we relate to crowding effects. This work advances our understanding of the soft corona, bridging experimental limitations with improved simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>

      <title>Theory of Kinetically-Constrained-Models Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean-field theory of Kinetically-Constrained-Models is developed by considering the Fredrickson-Andersen model on the Bethe lattice. Using certain properties of the dynamics observed in actual numerical experiments we derive asymptotic dynamical equations equal to those of Mode-Coupling-Theory. Analytical predictions obtained for the dynamical exponents are successfully compared with numerical simulations in a wide range of models, including the case of generic values of the connectivity and the facilitation, random pinning and fluctuating facilitation. The theory is thus validated for both continuous and discontinuous transitions and also in the case of higher order critical points characterized by logarithmic decays.</description>
