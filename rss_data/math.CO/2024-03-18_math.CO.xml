      <title>Stability of transversal Hamilton cycles and paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given graphs $G_1,\ldots,G_s$ all on a common vertex set and a graph $H$ with $e(H) = s$, a copy of $H$ is \emph{transversal} or \emph{rainbow} if it contains one edge from each $G_i$. We establish a stability result for transversal Hamilton cycles: the minimum degree required to guarantee a transversal Hamilton cycle can be lowered as long as the graph collection $G_1,\ldots,G_n$ is far in edit distance from several extremal cases. We obtain an analogous result for Hamilton paths. The proof is a combination of our newly developed regularity-blow-up method for transversals, along with the absorption method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various authors have calculated how many pairwise incomparable points can be selected from a partially ordered set. We tackle this question for the family of subsets of a finite set obtained by removing or adding a bounded number of elements from a given subset. Our versatile approach is proven valid under the condition of the set size exceeding the cube of the radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce the concept of universal graph series. We then present four invariants of graphs and discuss some of their properties. In particular, one of these invariants is a generalization of the chromatic symmetric function and a complete invariant for graphs.</description>

      <title>Generalized zero-divisor graph of $*$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with involution $*$ and $Z^*(R)$ denotes the set of all non-zero zero-divisors of $R$.
  We associate a simple (undirected) graph $\Gamma'(R)$ with vertex set $Z^*(R)$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent in $\Gamma'(R)$ if and only if $x^ny^*=0$ or $y^nx^*=0$, for some positive integer $n$. We find the diameter and girth of $\Gamma'(R)$. The characterizations are obtained for $*$-rings having $\Gamma'(R)$ a connected graph, a complete graph, and a star graph. Further, we have shown that for a ring $R$, there is an involution on $R\times R$ such that $\Gamma'(R\times R)$ is disconnected if and only if $R$ is an integral domain.</description>

      <title>Extremal spectral results of planar graphs without $C_{l, l}$ or $\mathrm{Theta}$ graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal {F}$ be a given family of graphs. A graph $G$ is $\mathcal {F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal {F}$ as a subgraph. Let $C_{l, l}$ be a graph obtained from $2C_l$ such that the two cycles share a common vertex, where $l\geqslant3 $. A $\mathrm{Theta}$ graph is obtained from a cycle $C_k$ by adding an additional edge between two non-consecutive vertices on $C_k$, where $k\geqslant 4$. Let $\Theta_k$ be set of $\mathrm{Theta}$ graphs, where $k \geqslant 4$. For sufficiently large $n $, the unique extremal planar graph with the maximum spectral radius among $C_{l, l}$-free planar graphs on $n$ vertices and among $\Theta_k$-free planar graphs on $n$ vertices are characterized respectively, where $l \geqslant 3$ and $k \geqslant 4$.</description>

      <title>The inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP and Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multispecies $t$-PushTASEP system on a finite ring of $n$ sites with site-dependent rates $x_1,\dots,x_n$. Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$ be a partition whose parts represent the species of the $n$ particles on the ring. We show that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q,t)$ at $q=1$; the normalizing constant (or partition function) is the Macdonald polynomial $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ at $q=1$. Our approach involves new relations between the families of ASEP polynomials and of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials at $q=1$. We also use multiline diagrams, showing that a single jump of the PushTASEP system is closely related to the operation of moving from one line to the next in a multiline diagram. We derive symmetry properties for the system under permutation of its jump rates, as well as a formula for the current of a single-species system.</description>

      <title>Packing the largest trees in the tree packing conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous tree packing conjecture of Gy\'arf\'as from 1976 says that any sequence of trees $T_1,\ldots,T_n$ such that $|T_i|=i$ for each $i\in [n]$ packs into the complete $n$-vertex graph $K_n$. Packing even just the largest trees in such a sequence has proven difficult, with Bollob\'as drawing attention to this in 1995 by conjecturing that, for each $k$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then the largest $k$ trees in any such sequence can be packed into $K_n$. This has only been shown for $k\leq 5$, by \.{Z}ak, despite many partial results and much related work on the full tree packing conjecture. We prove Bollob\'as's conjecture, by showing that, moreover, a linear number of the largest trees can be packed in the tree packing conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [NVP22], Nguyen and Van Peski raised the question of whether the surjective flag of $\mathbb Z_p$-modules modeled by $\mathrm{cok}(M_1\cdots M_k)\twoheadrightarrow \dots\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{cok}(M_1)$ for independent random matrices $M_1,\dots,M_k\in \mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb Z_p)$ satisfies the Cohen--Lenstra heuristic. We answer the question affirmatively when $M_1,\dots,M_k$ follow the Haar measure, and our proof demonstrates how classical ideas in Cohen--Lenstra heuristic adapt naturally to the flag setting. We also prove an analogue for non-square matrices.</description>

      <title>Representations from matrix varieties, and filtered RSK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix Schubert varieties (Fulton '92) carry natural actions of Levi groups. Their coordinate rings are thereby Levi-representations; what is a combinatorial counting rule for the multiplicities of their irreducibles? When the Levi group is a torus, (Knutson-Miller '04) answers the question. We present a general solution, a common refinement of the multigraded Hilbert series, the Cauchy identity, and the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Our result applies to any ``bicrystalline'' algebraic variety; we define these using the operators of (Kashiwara '95) and of (Danilov-Koshevoi '05, van Leeuwen '06). The proof introduces a ``filtered'' generalization of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.</description>

      <title>Poset polytopes and pipe dreams: toric degenerations and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how pipe dreams can be applied to the theory of poset polytopes to produce toric degenerations of flag varieties. Specifically, we present such constructions for marked chain-order polytopes of Dynkin types A and C. These toric degenerations also give rise to further algebraic and geometric objects such as PBW-monomial bases and Newton--Okounkov bodies. We discuss a construction of the former in the type A case and of the latter in type C.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the closure of the graph of the birational map from a projective space to a Grassmannian. We provide explicit description of the graph closure and compute the fibers of the natural projection to the Grassmannian. We construct embeddings of the graph closure to the projectivizations of certain cyclic representations of a degenerate special linear Lie algebra and study algebraic and combinatorial properties of these representations. In particular, we describe monomial bases, generalizing the FFLV bases. The proof relies on combinatorial properties of a new family of poset polytopes, which are of independent interest. As a consequence we obtain flat toric degenerations of the graph closure studied by Borovik, Sturmfels and Sverrisd\'ottir.</description>

      <title>The Euclidean MST-ratio for Bi-colored Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set, $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, and a subset, $B \subseteq A$, the \emph{MST-ratio} is the combined length of the minimum spanning trees of $B$ and $A \setminus B$ divided by the length of the minimum spanning tree of $A$.
  The question of the supremum, over all sets $A$, of the maximum, over all subsets $B$, is related to the Steiner ratio, and we prove this sup-max is between $2.154$ and $2.427$.
  Restricting ourselves to $2$-dimensional lattices, we prove that the sup-max is $2.0$, while the inf-max is $1.25$.
  By some margin the most difficult of these results is the upper bound for the inf-max, which we prove by showing that the hexagonal lattice cannot have MST-ratio larger than $1.25$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a notion of decomposition of planar point sets (or rather of their chirotopes) as trees decorated by smaller chirotopes. This decomposition is based on the concept of mutually avoiding sets (which we rephrase as \emph{modules}), and adapts in some sense the modular decomposition of graphs in the world of chirotopes. The associated tree always exists and is unique up to some appropriate constraints. We also show how to compute the number of triangulations of a chirotope efficiently, starting from its tree and the (weighted) numbers of triangulations of its parts.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study a three-folded linear operator depending on three parameters that has associated a triangular number tilling of the plane. As a result the set of all triples of integers is decomposed in classes of equivalence organized in four towers of two-dimensional triangulations. We provide the full characterization of the represented integers belonging to each network as families of certain quadratic forms. We note that one of the towers is generated by a germ that produces a covering of the plane with {L\"oschian} numbers.</description>

Abstract: We show that every $3$-connected $K_{2,\ell}$-minor free graph with minimum degree at least $4$ has maximum degree at most $7\ell$. As a consequence, we show that every 3-connected $K_{2,\ell}$-minor free graph with minimum degree at least $5$ and no twins of degree $5$ has bounded size. Our proofs use Steiner trees and nested cuts; in particular, they do not rely on Ding's characterization of $K_{2,\ell}$-minor free graphs.</description>

Abstract: Strong blocking sets, introduced first in 2011 in connection with saturating sets, have recently gained a lot of attention due to their correspondence with minimal codes. In this paper, we dig into the geometry of the concatenation method, introducing the concept of outer strong blocking sets and their coding theoretical counterpart. We investigate their structure and provide bounds on their size. As a byproduct, we improve the best-known upper bound on the minimum size of a strong blocking set. Finally, we present a geometric construction of small strong blocking sets, whose computational cost is significantly smaller than the previously known ones.</description>

Two other studied statistics on $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are $\mathrm{depth}$ and $\mathrm{exc}$. Using descents in ${\it canonical\ reduced\ words}$ of elements in $\mathfrak{S}_n$, we give an involution $f_A: \mathfrak{S}_n \mapsto \mathfrak{S}_n$ that leads to a neat formula for the signed trivariate enumerator of $\mathrm{drops},\mathrm{depth}, \mathrm{exc}$ in $\mathfrak{S}_n$. This gives a simple formula for the signed univariate drops enumerator in $\mathfrak{S}_n$. For the type-B Coxeter group $\mathfrak{B}_n$ as well, using similar techniques, we show analogous results. For the type D Coxeter group, we again get analogous results, but our proof is inductive.
  Under the famous Foata-Zeilberger bijection $\phi_{FZ}$ which takes permutations to restricted Laguerre histories, we show that permutations $\pi$ and $f_A(\pi)$ map to the same Motzkin path, but have different history components. Using the Foata-Zeilberger bijection, we also get a continued fraction for the generating function enumerating the pair of statistics $\mathrm{drops}$ and $\mathrm{MAD}$. Graham and Diaconis determined the mean and the variance of the Spearman metric of disarray $D(\pi)$ when one samples $\pi$ from $\mathfrak{S}_n$ at random. As an application of our results, we get the mean and variance of the statistic $\mathrm{drops}(\pi)$ when we sample $\pi$ from $\mathcal{A}_n$ at random.</description>

      <title>Lattice Points and Rational $q$-Catalan Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each pair of coprime integers $a$ and $b$ one defines the "rational $q$-Catalan number" $\mathrm{Cat}(a,b)_q=\bigl[\hskip-1.5pt \begin{smallmatrix}{a-1+b}\\{a-1}\end{smallmatrix}\hskip-1pt\bigr]_q/[a]_q$. It is known that this is a polynomial in $q$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, but this phenomenon is mysterious. Despite recent progress in the understanding of these polynomials and their two-variable $q,t$-analogues, we still lack a simple combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients. The current paper builds on a conjecture of Paul Johnson relating $q$-Catalan numbers to lattice points. The main idea of this approach is to fix $a$ and express everything in terms of the weight lattice of type $A_{a-1}$. For a given $a$ we construct a family of $(a-2)\phi(a)+1$ polynomials called "$q$-Catalan germs" and for each integer $b$ coprime to $a$ we express $\mathrm{Cat}(a,b)_q$ in terms of germs. We conjecture that the germs have nonnegative coefficients and we show that this nonnegativity conjecture is implied by a stronger conjecture about "ribbon partitions" of certain subposets of Young's lattice.</description>

      <title>Universal Definitions of the Roman Factorial: Introduction to Foundational Functions and the Generalization Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for redefining the Roman factorial using universally applicable functions that are not expressed in closed form. We present a set of foundational functions, similar to Boolean operations, to simplify the factorial expression. Through a systematic process of generalization, termed generalization process, we aim to use these foundational functions to create recursive and non-recursive, global definitions of the Roman factorial.</description>

      <title>On $r$-to-$p$ norms of random matrices with nonnegative entries: Asymptotic normality and $\ell_\infty$-bounds for the maximizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.14056v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an $n\times n$ matrix $A_n$, the $r\to p$ operator norm is defined as $$\|A_n\|_{r\to p}:= \sup_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n:\|\mathbf{x} \|_r\leq 1 } \|A_n\mathbf{x} \|_p\quad\text{for}\quad r,p\geq 1.$$ For different choices of $r$ and $p$, this norm corresponds to key quantities that arise in diverse applications including matrix condition number estimation, clustering of data, and construction of oblivious routing schemes in transportation networks. This article considers $r\to p$ norms of symmetric random matrices with nonnegative entries, including adjacency matrices of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, matrices with positive sub-Gaussian entries, and certain sparse matrices. For $1&lt;p\leq r&lt;\infty$, the asymptotic normality, as $n\to\infty$, of the appropriately centered and scaled norm $\|A_n\|_{r\to p}$ is established. When $p \geq 2$, this is shown to imply asymptotic normality of the solution to the $\ell_p$ quadratic maximization problem, also known as the $\ell_p$ Grothendieck problem. Furthermore, a sharp $\ell_\infty$-approximation bound for the unique maximizing vector in the definition of $\|A_n\|_{r\to p}$ is obtained, and may be viewed as an $\ell_\infty$-stability result of the maximizer under random perturbations of the matrix with mean entries. This result is in fact shown to hold for a broad class of deterministic sequences of matrices having certain asymptotic expansion properties. The results obtained can be viewed as a generalization of the seminal results of F\"{u}redi and Koml\'{o}s (1981) on asymptotic normality of the largest singular value of a class of symmetric random matrices. In the general case with $1&lt;p\leq r&lt; \infty$, spectral methods are no longer applicable, and so a new approach is developed involving a refined convergence analysis of a nonlinear power method and a perturbation bound on the maximizing vector, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Torus quotient of the Grassmannian $G_{n,2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G_{n,2n}$ be the Grassmannian parameterizing the $n$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^{2n}.$ The Picard group of $G_{n,2n}$ is generated by a unique ample line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1).$ Let $T$ be a maximal torus of $SL(2n,\mathbb{C})$ which acts on $G_{n,2n}$ and $\mathcal{O}(1).$ By \cite[Theorem 3.10, p.764]{Kum}, $2$ is the minimal integer $k$ such that $\mathcal{O}(k)$ descends to the GIT quotient. In this article, we prove that the GIT quotient of $G_{n,2n}$ ($n\ge 3$) by $T$ with respect to $\mathcal{O}(2)=\mathcal{O}(1)^{\otimes 2}$ is not projectively normal when polarized with the descent of $\mathcal{O}(2).$</description>

Abstract: We study asymptotic infinitesimal distribution of Gaussian Unitary Ensembles with permuted entries. We show that for random uniform permutation asymptotically permuted GUE matrix has null infinitesimal distribution. Moreover we show that asymptotically different permutations of the same GUE matrix are infinitesimally free. Besides this we study particular example of entry permutation - the transpose and we show that while a GUE matrix is asymptotically free from its transpose it is not infinitesimally free from it.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Exchangeable Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a complexity measure for exchangeable graphs by considering the graph-generating mechanism. Exchangeability for graphs implies distributional invariance under node permutations, making it a suitable default model for a wide range of graph data. For this well-studied class of graphs, we quantify complexity using graphon entropy. Graphon entropy is a graph property, meaning it is invariant under graph isomorphisms. Therefore, we focus on estimating the entropy of the generating mechanism for a graph realization, rather than selecting a specific graph feature. This approach allows us to consider the global properties of a graph, capturing its important graph-theoretic and topological characteristics, such as sparsity, symmetry, and connectedness. We introduce a consistent graphon entropy estimator that achieves the nonparametric rate for any arbitrary exchangeable graph with a smooth graphon representative. Additionally, we develop tailored entropy estimators for situations where more information about the underlying graphon is available, specifically for widely studied random graph models such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Configuration Model and Stochastic Block Model. We determine their large-sample properties by providing a Central Limit Theorem for the first two, and a convergence rate for the third model. We also conduct a simulation study to illustrate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the connection between graphon entropy and graph structure. Finally, we investigate the role of our entropy estimator as a complexity measure for characterizing real-world graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any Kac-Moody root data $\mathcal D$, D. Muthiah and D. Orr have defined a partial order on the semi-direct product $W^+$ of the integral Tits cone with the vectorial Weyl group of $\mathcal D$, and a strictly compatible $\mathbb Z$-valued length function. We classify covers for this order and show that this length function defines a $\mathbb Z$-grading of $W^+$, generalizing the case of affine ADE root systems and giving a positive answer to a conjecture of Muthiah and Orr.</description>

      <title>Khintchine-type double recurrence in abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Khintchine-type recurrence theorem for pairs of endomorphisms of a countable discrete abelian group. As a special case of the main result, if $\Gamma$ is a countable discrete abelian group, $\varphi, \psi \in End(\Gamma)$, and $\psi - \varphi$ is an injective endomorphism with finite index image, then for any ergodic measure-preserving $\Gamma$-system $\left( X, \mathcal{X}, \mu, (T_g)_{g \in \Gamma} \right)$, any measurable set $A \in \mathcal{X}$, and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the set of $g \in \Gamma$ for which $$\mu \left( A \cap T_{\varphi(g)}^{-1} A \cap T_{\psi(g)}^{-1} A \right) &gt; \mu(A)^3 - \varepsilon$$ is syndetic. This generalizes the main results of (Ackelsberg--Bergelson--Shalom, 2022) and essentially answers a question left open in that paper (Question 1.12).
  For the group $\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}^d$, we deduce that for any matrices $M_1, M_2 \in M_{d \times d}(\mathbb{Z})$ whose difference $M_2 - M_1$ is nonsingular, any ergodic measure-preserving $\mathbb{Z}^d$-system $\left( X, \mathcal{X}, \mu, (T_{\vec{n}})_{\vec{n} \in \mathbb{Z}^d} \right)$, any measurable set $A \in \mathcal{X}$, and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the set of $\vec{n} \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ for which $$\mu \left( A \cap T_{M_1 \vec{n}}^{-1} A \cap T_{M_2 \vec{n}}^{-1} A \right) &gt; \mu(A)^3 - \varepsilon$$ is syndetic, a result that was previously known only in the case $d = 2$.
  The key ingredients in the proof are: (1) a recent result obtained jointly with Bergelson and Shalom that says that the relevant ergodic averages are controlled by a characteristic factor closely related to the quasi-affine (or Conze--Lesigne) factor; (2) an extension trick to reduce to systems with well-behaved (with respect to $\varphi$ and $\psi$) discrete spectrum; and (3) a description of Mackey groups associated to quasi-affine cocycles over rotational systems with well-behaved discrete spectrum.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Rearrangement is Fixed-Parameter Tractable in the Single Cut-and-Join Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement is a common model for molecular evolution. In this paper, we consider the Pairwise Rearrangement problem, which takes as input two genomes and asks for the number of minimum-length sequences of permissible operations transforming the first genome into the second. In the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010), Pairwise Rearrangement is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete (Bailey, et. al., COCOON 2023), which implies that exact sampling is intractable. In order to cope with this intractability, we investigate the parameterized complexity of this problem. We exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of components in the adjacency graph that are not cycles of length $2$ or paths of length $1$. As a consequence, we obtain that Pairwise Rearrangement in the Single Cut-and-Join model is fixed-parameter tractable by distance. Our results suggest that the number of nontrivial components in the adjacency graph serves as the key obstacle for efficient sampling.</description>
