      <title>The inclusive Synthetic Control Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the inclusive synthetic control method (iSCM), a modification of synthetic control type methods that allows the inclusion of units potentially affected directly or indirectly by an intervention in the donor pool. This method is well suited for applications with either multiple treated units or in which some of the units in the donor pool might be affected by spillover effects. Our iSCM is very easy to implement using most synthetic control type estimators. As an illustrative empirical example, we re-estimate the causal effect of German reunification on GDP per capita allowing for spillover effects from West Germany to Austria.</description>

      <title>Deconvolution from two order statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic data are often contaminated by measurement errors and truncated by ranking. This paper shows that the classical measurement error model with independent and additive measurement errors is identified nonparametrically using only two order statistics of repeated measurements. The identification result confirms a hypothesis by Athey and Haile (2002) for a symmetric ascending auction model with unobserved heterogeneity. Extensions allow for heterogeneous measurement errors, broadening the applicability to additional empirical settings, including asymmetric auctions and wage offer models. We adapt an existing simulated sieve estimator and illustrate its performance in finite samples.</description>

      <title>A Practical Introduction to Regression Discontinuity Designs: Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph, together with its accompanying first part Cattaneo, Idrobo and Titiunik (2020), collects and expands the instructional materials we prepared for more than $50$ short courses and workshops on Regression Discontinuity (RD) methodology that we taught between 2014 and 2023. In this second monograph, we discuss several topics in RD methodology that build on and extend the analysis of RD designs introduced in Cattaneo, Idrobo and Titiunik (2020). Our first goal is to present an alternative RD conceptual framework based on local randomization ideas. This methodological approach can be useful in RD designs with discretely-valued scores, and can also be used more broadly as a complement to the continuity-based approach in other settings. Then, employing both continuity-based and local randomization approaches, we extend the canonical Sharp RD design in multiple directions: fuzzy RD designs, RD designs with discrete scores, and multi-dimensional RD designs. The goal of our two-part monograph is purposely practical and hence we focus on the empirical analysis of RD designs.</description>

      <title>When is cross impact relevant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trading pressure from one asset can move the price of another, a phenomenon referred to as cross impact. Using tick-by-tick data spanning 5 years for 500 assets listed in the United States, we identify the features that make cross-impact relevant to explain the variance of price returns. We show that price formation occurs endogenously within highly liquid assets. Then, trades in these assets influence the prices of less liquid correlated products, with an impact velocity constrained by their minimum trading frequency. We investigate the implications of such a multidimensional price formation mechanism on interest rate markets. We find that the 10-year bond future serves as the primary liquidity reservoir, influencing the prices of cash bonds and futures contracts within the interest rate curve. Such behaviour challenges the validity of the theory in Financial Economics that regards long-term rates as agents anticipations of future short term rates.</description>
