      <title>A remark on inverse limits of effective subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for every finitely generated group with decidable word problem and undecidable domino problem, there exists a sequence of effective subshifts whose inverse limit is not the topological factor of any effective dynamical system. This follows from considerations on the universality under topological factors for this class of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Unique Reconstruction From Mean-Field Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of reconstructing both the structure and dynamics of a network from mean-field measurements, which are linear combinations of node states. This setting arises in applications where only a few aggregated observations are available, making network inference challenging. We focus on the case when the number of mean-field measurements is smaller than the number of nodes. To tackle this ill-posed recovery problem, we propose a framework that combines localized initial perturbations with sparse optimization techniques. We derive sufficient conditions that guarantee the unique reconstruction of the network's adjacency matrix from mean-field data and enable recovery of node states and local governing dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach across a range of sparsity and connectivity regimes. These results provide theoretical and computational foundations for inferring high-dimensional networked systems from low-dimensional observations.</description>

      <title>Partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms homotopic to the identity in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism homotopic to the identity is accessible unless the fundamental group of its ambient 3-manifold is virtually solvable. As a consequence, such diffeomorphisms are ergodic, giving an affirmative answer to the Hertz-Hertz-Ures Ergodicity Conjecture in the homotopy class of identity.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Kalman filters for uncertain dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalman(-Bucy) filter is the natural choice for the state reconstruction of disturbed, linear dynamical systems based on flawed and incomplete measurements. Taking a deterministic viewpoint this work investigates possible extensions of the concept to systems with uncertain dynamics and noise covariances. In a theoretical analysis error bounds in terms of the variance of the uncertainties are derived. The article concludes with a numerical implementation of two example systems allowing for a comparison of the estimators.</description>

      <title>On surjectivity and dynamical properties of dill maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study certain dynamical properties of dill maps, a class of functions introduced in~\cite{salo2015block} that generalizes both cellular automata and substitutions. In particular, we prove that surjective uniform dill maps are precisely the surjective cellular automata. We also establish a sufficient condition for a dill map to be equicontinuous.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for the pseudo-Riemannian geodesic flows of step-two nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper deals with the stability analysis for the geodesic flow of a step-two nilpotent Lie group equipped with a left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric. The Lie-Poisson equation can be described in terms of the so-called $j$-mapping, a linear operator associated to the step-two nilpotent Lie algebras equipped with the induced scalar product. The stability of equilibrium points for the Hamilton equation is determined in terms of their Williamson types.</description>

      <title>Grazing-sliding bifurcations in planar $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Filippov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore the effect of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry on grazing-sliding bifurcations in planar Filippov systems. We consider the scenario where the unperturbed system is $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric and its subsystem exhibits a hyperbolic limit cycle grazing the discontinuity boundary at a fold. Employing differential manifold theory, we reveal the intrinsic quantities of unfolding all bifurcations and rigorously demonstrate the emergence of a codimension-two bifurcation under generic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric perturbations within the Filippov framework. After deriving an explicit non-degenerate condition with respect to parameters, we systematically establish the complete bifurcation diagram with exact asymptotics for all bifurcation boundaries by displacement map method combined with asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <title>Typical Uniqueness in Ergodic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For ergodic optimization on any topological dynamical system, with real-valued potential function $f$ belonging to any separable Banach space $B$ of continuous functions, we show that the $f$-maximizing measure is typically unique, in the strong sense that a countable collection of hypersurfaces contains the exceptional set of those $f\in B$ with non-unique maximizing measure. This strengthens previous results asserting that the uniqueness set is both residual and prevalent.</description>

      <title>On the original Ulam's problem and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that under general resonance the classical piecewise linear Fermi-Ulam accelerator behaves substantially different from its quantization in the sense that the classical accelerator exhibits typical recurrence and non-escaping while the quantum version enjoys quadratic energy growth in general. We also describe a procedure to locate the escaping orbits, though exceptionally rare in the infinite-volume phase space, for the classical accelerators, which in particular include Ulam's very original proposal and the linearly escaping orbits therein in the existing literature, and hence provide a complete (modulo a null set) answer to Ulam's original question. For the quantum accelerators, we reveal under resonance the direct and explicit connection between the energy growth and the shape of the quasi-energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Besicovitch-Eggleston sets for non-autonomous systems with countable symbolic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we derive a formula for the Hausdorff dimension of Besicovitch-Eggleston level sets associated with non-autonomous dynamics constructed from families of countable affine iterated function systems. The formula obtained shows that the universal-lower-bound phenomenon present in the autonomous case studied by Fan et al. (2010) persists in this non-autonomous setting.</description>

      <title>The Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem of random dynamical systems for amenable group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem is one of the most important results in information theory, which can describe the random ergodic process, and its proof uses the famous Birkhoff ergodic theorem, so it can be seen that it plays a crucial role in ergodic theory. In this paper, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem in the random dynamical systems is proved from the perspective of an amenable group action, which provides a boost for the development of entropy theory in the random dynamical systems for amenable group actions.</description>

      <title>Overgroups of the arboreal representation of PCF polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a number field $K$ and a rational function $f$ of degree greater than 1 over $K$. By taking preimages of $\alpha\in K$ under successive iterates of $f$, an infinite $d$-ary tree $T_\infty$ rooted at $\alpha$ can be constructed. An edge is assigned between two preimages $x$ and $y$ if $f(x)=y$. The absolute Galois group of $K$, acting on $T_\infty$ through tree automorphisms, generates a subgroup $\text{Gal}_f^\infty(\alpha)$ in the group of all automorphisms of $T_\infty$, $\text{Aut}(T_\infty)$.
  We have discovered a new class of natural overgroups in which the image of the Galois representation attached to a PCF polynomial must reside. Moreover, we have found that the image of the Galois representation of a new PCF polynomial is isomorphic to one of these overgroups. We also investigate the structure of these overgroups for specific maps, such as normalized dynamical Belyi polynomials, and show that the normal subgroups of these overgroups form a unique chief series. This allows us to bound the number of generators through group-theoretic analysis.</description>

      <title>Information Geometry on the $\ell^2$-Simplex via the $q$-Root Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \emph{$\ell^p$-information geometry}, an infinite dimensional framework that shares key features with the geometry of the space of probability densities \( \mathrm{Dens}(M) \) on a closed manifold, while also incorporating aspects of measure-valued information geometry. We define the \emph{$\ell^2$-probability simplex} with a noncanonical differentiable structure induced via the \emph{$q$-root transform} from an open subset of the $\ell^p$-sphere. This structure renders the $q$-root map an \emph{isometry}, enabling the definition of \emph{Amari--\v{C}encov $\alpha$-connections} in this setting.
  We further construct \emph{gradient flows} with respect to the $\ell^2$ Fisher--Rao metric, which solve an infinite-dimensional linear optimization problem. These flows are intimately linked to an \emph{integrable Hamiltonian system} via a \emph{momentum map} arising from a Hamiltonian group action on the infinite-dimensional complex projective space.</description>

      <title>A condensing approach to multiple shooting neural ordinary differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-shooting is a parameter estimation approach for ordinary differential equations. In this approach, the trajectory is broken into small intervals, each of which can be integrated independently. Equality constraints are then applied to eliminate the shooting gap between the end of the previous trajectory and the start of the next trajectory. Unlike single-shooting, multiple-shooting is more stable, especially for highly oscillatory and long trajectories. In the context of neural ordinary differential equations, multiple-shooting is not widely used due to the challenge of incorporating general equality constraints. In this work, we propose a condensing-based approach to incorporate these shooting equality constraints while training a multiple-shooting neural ordinary differential equation (MS-NODE) using first-order optimization methods such as Adam.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Reproduction Number for Determining Boundary Steady State Stability in Chemical Reaction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the boundary reproduction number, adapted from the next generation matrix method, to assess whether an infusion of species will persist or become exhausted in a chemical reaction system. Our main contributions are as follows: (a) we show how the concept of a siphon, prevalent in Petri nets and chemical reaction network theory, identifies sets of species that may become depleted at steady state, analogous to a disease-free boundary steady state; (b) we develop an approach for incorporating biochemically motivated conservation laws, which allows the stability of boundary steady states to be determined within specific compatibility classes; and (c) we present an effective heuristic for decomposing the Jacobian of the system that reduces the computational complexity required to compute the stability domain of a boundary steady state. The boundary reproduction number approach significantly simplifies existing parameter-dependent methods for determining the stability of boundary steady states in chemical reaction systems and has implications for the capacity of critical metabolites and substrates in metabolic pathways to become exhausted.</description>

Abstract: A hyperbolic-like group is a subgroup of $\operatorname{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ such that every non-trivial element has exactly two fixed points, one attracting and one repelling. We investigate the ping-pong dynamics of hyperbolic-like groups, inspired by a conjecture of Bonatti. We show the existence of a proper ping-pong partition for any pair of non-cyclic point stabilizers. More precisely, our results explicitly provide such a ping-pong partition.</description>

      <title>Signature Maximum Mean Discrepancy Two-Sample Statistical Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a widely used concept in machine learning research which has gained popularity in recent years as a highly effective tool for comparing (finite-dimensional) distributions. Since it is designed as a kernel-based method, the MMD can be extended to path space valued distributions using the signature kernel. The resulting signature MMD (sig-MMD) can be used to define a metric between distributions on path space. Similarly to the original use case of the MMD as a test statistic within a two-sample testing framework, the sig-MMD can be applied to determine if two sets of paths are drawn from the same stochastic process. This work is dedicated to understanding the possibilities and challenges associated with applying the sig-MMD as a statistical tool in practice. We introduce and explain the sig-MMD, and provide easily accessible and verifiable examples for its practical use. We present examples that can lead to Type 2 errors in the hypothesis test, falsely indicating that samples have been drawn from the same underlying process (which generally occurs in a limited data setting). We then present techniques to mitigate the occurrence of this type of error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the planar circular restricted three-body problem for energy levels slightly above the first critical value. We first observe that the energy hypersurfaces in the Birkhoff regularization corresponding to these energy levels are of contact type. Then, using a version of Rabinowitz Floer homology and an analytic continuation argument, we establish the existence of a symmetric consecutive collision orbit and, furthermore, prove the existence of infinitely many such orbits for generic mass ratios and energy levels.</description>

      <title>An adaptive data sampling strategy for stabilizing dynamical systems via controller inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning stabilizing controllers from data is an important task in engineering applications; however, collecting informative data is challenging because unstable systems often lead to rapidly growing or erratic trajectories. In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that generates data while simultaneously stabilizing the system to avoid instabilities during the data collection. Under mild assumptions, the approach provably generates data sets that are informative for stabilization and have minimal size. The numerical experiments demonstrate that controller inference with the novel adaptive sampling approach learns controllers with up to one order of magnitude fewer data samples than unguided data generation. The results show that the proposed approach opens the door to stabilizing systems in edge cases and limit states where instabilities often occur and data collection is inherently difficult.</description>

      <title>Sparkling saddle loops of vector fields on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.01933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bifurcations of vector fields on 2-manifolds with handles in generic one-parameter families unfolding vector fields with a separatrix loop of a hyperbolic saddle. These bifurcations can differ drastically from the analogous bifurcations on the sphere. The reason is that, on a surface, a free separatrix of a hyperbolic saddle may wind toward the separatrix loop of the same saddle. When this loop is broken, sparkling saddle loops emerge. In the orientable case, the parameter values corresponding to these loops form the endpoints of the gaps in a Cantor set contained within the bifurcation diagram. Due to the presence of a Cantor set, there is a countable set of topologically non-equivalent germs of bifurcation diagrams even in generic one-parameter families, in contrast to bifurcations on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Ahlfors-regular conformal dimension and energies of graph maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hyperbolic rational map $f$ with connected Julia set, we give upper and lower bounds on the Ahlfors-regular conformal dimension of its Julia set $J_f$ from a family of energies of associated graph maps. Concretely, the dynamics of $f$ is faithfully encoded by a pair of maps $\pi, \phi : G_1 \to G_0$ between finite graphs that satisfies a natural expanding condition. Associated to this combinatorial data, for each $q \geq 1$, is a numerical invariant $\overline{E}^q[\pi,\phi]$, its asymptotic $q$-conformal energy. We show that the Ahlfors-regular conformal dimension of $J_f$ is contained in the interval where $\overline{E}^q=1$.
  Among other applications, we give two families of quartic rational maps with Ahlfors-regular conformal dimension approaching 1 and 2, respectively.</description>

      <title>Braid stability for periodic orbits of area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an area-preserving diffeomorphism of a compact surface, which is assumed to be an irrational rotation near each boundary component. A finite set of periodic orbits of the diffeomorphism gives rise to a braid in the mapping torus. We show that under some nondegeneracy hypotheses, the isotopy classes of braids that arise from finite sets of periodic orbits are stable under Hamiltonian perturbations that are small with respect to the Hofer metric. A corollary is that for a Hamiltonian isotopy class of such maps, the topological entropy is lower semicontinuous with respect to the Hofer metric. This extends results of Alves-Meiwes for braids arising from finite sets of fixed points of Hamiltonian surface diffeomorphisms.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a methodology to prove existence of (fiberwise hyperbolic) real-analytic invariant tori in real-analytic quasi-periodic skew-product dynamical systems that present nearly-invariant tori of the same characteristics. The methodology is based on the application of a Newton-Kantorovich theorem whose hypotheses are tested using Fourier analysis methods for a numerical approximation of the parameterization of an invariant torus.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency Removal of Reduced Bases in Parametric Model Order Reduction by Matrix Interpolation using Adaptive Sampling and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric model order reduction by matrix interpolation allows for efficient prediction of the behavior of dynamic systems without requiring knowledge about the underlying parametric dependency. Within this approach, reduced models are first sampled and then made consistent with each other by transforming the underlying reduced bases. Finally, the transformed reduced operators can be interpolated to predict reduced models for queried parameter points. However, the accuracy of the predicted reduced model strongly depends on the similarity of the sampled reduced bases. If the local reduced bases change significantly over the parameter space, inconsistencies are introduced in the training data for the matrix interpolation. These strong changes in the reduced bases can occur due to the model order reduction method used, a change of the system's dynamics with a change of the parameters, and mode switching and truncation. In this paper, individual approaches for removing these inconsistencies are extended and combined into one general framework to simultaneously treat multiple sources of inconsistency. For that, modal truncation is used for the reduction, an adaptive sampling of the parameter space is performed, and eventually, the parameter space is partitioned into regions in which all local reduced bases are consistent with each other. The proposed framework is applied to a cantilever Timoshenko beam and the Kelvin cell for one- to three-dimensional parameter spaces. Compared to the original version of parametric model order reduction by matrix interpolation and an existing method for inconsistency removal, the proposed framework leads to parametric reduced models with significantly smaller errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimization of ergodic averages for multi-valued dynamical systems, i.e. where points may have multiple different forward orbits. Under upper semi-continuity assumptions, we show that the maximum space average with respect to invariant probability measures for such systems can be characterised in terms of maximum time averages on an auxiliary shift space. For all multi-valued expanding systems that are open mappings, we show that every H\"older continuous real-valued function can be modified by a coboundary, of the same H\"older exponent, such that the resulting function is dominated by its maximum ergodic average.</description>

      <title>Confabulation dynamics in a reservoir computer: Filling in the gaps with untrained attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Kvalheim and Sontag provided a generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for equilibria under asymptotically stable continuous vector fields. By leveraging topological properties of Lyapunov functions, their theorem works without assuming hyperbolicity. We extend their theorem to a class of possibly discontinuous vector fields, in particular, to vector fields generating asymptotically stable semiflows.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses reduction by symmetries for autonomous and non-autonomous forced mechanical systems with inelastic collisions. In particular, we introduce the notion of generalized hybrid momentum map and hybrid constants of the motion to give general conditions on whether it is possible to perform symmetry reduction for Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems subject to non-conservative external forces and non-elastic impacts, as well as its extension to time-dependent mechanical systems subject to time-dependent external forces and time-dependent inelastic collisions. We illustrate the applicability of the method with examples and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Statistical Accuracy of Approximate Filtering Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the statistics of the state of a dynamical system, from partial and noisy observations, is both mathematically challenging and finds wide application. Furthermore, the applications are of great societal importance, including problems such as probabilistic weather forecasting and prediction of epidemics. Particle filters provide a well-founded approach to the problem, leading to provably accurate approximations of the statistics. However these methods perform poorly in high dimensions. In 1994 the idea of ensemble Kalman filtering was introduced by Evensen, leading to a methodology that has been widely adopted in the geophysical sciences and also finds application to quite general inverse problems. However, ensemble Kalman filters have defied rigorous analysis of their statistical accuracy, except in the linear Gaussian setting. In this article we describe recent work which takes first steps to analyze the statistical accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters beyond the linear Gaussian setting. The subject is inherently technical, as it involves the evolution of probability measures according to a nonlinear and nonautonomous dynamical system; and the approximation of this evolution. It can nonetheless be presented in a fairly accessible fashion, understandable with basic knowledge of dynamical systems, numerical analysis and probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the group of $\mathbb Z$-linear automorphisms of the ring of integers of a number field $K$ that preserve the set $V_{K,k}$ of $k$th power-free integers: every such map is the composition of a field automorphism and the multiplication by a unit.
  We show that those maps together with translations generate the extended symmetry group of the shift space $\mathbb D_{K,k}$ associated to $V_{K,k}$. Moreover, we show that no two such dynamical systems $\mathbb D_{K,k}$ and $\mathbb D_{L,l}$ are topologically conjugate and no one is a factor system of another.
  We generalize the concept of $k$th power-free integers to sieves and study the resulting admissible shift spaces.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop stability.</description>
