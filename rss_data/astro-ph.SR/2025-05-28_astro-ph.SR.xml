      <title>Asteroseismic mass and radius of the naked-eye red giant HD145250</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first asteroseismic analysis of the bright, nearby red giant star, HD145250. We calculate the global seismic quantities of the star from single-sector, 2-minute TESS photometry, and determine its mass and radius to be ~1.4 M$_\odot$ and ~16 R$_\odot$ using asteroseismic scaling relations. Our values agree with published non-seismic mass and radius estimates based on comparisons with stellar evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>Photometric and Spectroscopic Studies of Two Early-Type Eclipsing Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-precision photometric data from TESS, medium resolution spectroscopic data from LAMOST, and long-term eclipse timings, we provide orbital parameters for two early-type detached eclipsing binary systems: TYC 3740-2072-1 and TYC 2888-780-1, and analyze the orbital period variations and evolutionary status of these two targets. TYC 3740-2072-1, with a spectral type of B1V, consists of a $6.914 M_\odot$ subgiant and a $6.233 M_\odot$ main-sequence component. It is expected to evolve into a semi-detached binary, potentially serving as a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova. TYC 2888-780-1 has a spectral type of A3 and consists of two main-sequence components with masses of $1.682 M_\odot$ and $1.673 M_\odot$, respectively. It is undergoing stable evolution. Through eclipse timing analysis, we find that both targets exhibit apsidal motion effects, with observed AM rates of $\dot{\omega}_{obs} = 0.0412~\text{deg}~\text{cycle}^{-1}$ and $\dot{\omega}_{obs} = 0.0205~\text{deg}~\text{cycle}^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, TYC 2888-780-1 exhibits orbital period variations, which we attribute to the light travel time effect caused by a third body, the minimum mass of this third body is estimated to be $0.598 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>TCP J07222683$+$6220548: a new AM CVn type system with infrequent outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of TCP J07222683$+$6220548, a new ultracompact binary system of the AM CVn type. This system was first identified displaying a $\Delta V = 7.6$ mag outburst on 2025-01-20.9416 UTC by the New Milky Way wide-field survey for transients and later independently detected by ASAS-SN and ZTF. The outburst peaked at $V_{\rm max} = 12.45$ and lasted for seven days, followed by a series of rebrightenings. No previous outbursts are found in archival data. Positive superhumps with a period of $0.032546 \pm 0.000084$ d ($46.87 \pm 0.12$ min), barely detectable during the main outburst, became clearly visible during the first rebrightening that lasted from day 18 to day 24 after the initial outburst. No convincing change in the superhump period was detected. Dense time-series photometry follow-up by a pair of 0.5-m INASAN robotic telescopes, together with VSNET and AAVSO observers, was essential for identifying TCP J07222683$+$6220548 as an AM CVn system and triggering confirmation spectroscopy with the 2.5-m CMO SAI telescope. Some outbursting AM CVn systems lacking such detailed follow-up may remain unrecognized among the newly discovered cataclysmic variable candidates.</description>

      <title>Unified Deep Learning Approach for Estimating the Metallicities of RR Lyrae Stars Using light curves from Gaia Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs, there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding, smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401; for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and Galactic structure.</description>

      <title>Comparing population synthesis models of compact double white dwarfs to electromagnetic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Studies of the Galactic population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that would be detectable in gravitational waves by LISA have found differences in the number of predicted detectable DWDs of more than an order of magnitude, depending on the binary stellar evolution model used. Particularly, the binary population synthesis code BPASS predicts 20 to 40 times fewer detectable DWDs than the codes SeBa or BSE, which relates to differing treatments of mass transfer and common-envelope events (CEEs).
  Aims: We aimed to investigate which of these models are closer to reality by comparing their predictions to the DWDs known from electromagnetic observations.
  Methods: We compared the DWDs predicted by a BPASS galaxy model and a SeBa galaxy model to a DWD catalogue and the sample of DWDs observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), taking into account the observational limits and biases of the ZTF survey.
  Results: We found that BPASS underpredicts the number of short-period DWDs by at least an order of magnitude compared to the observations, while the SeBa galaxy model is consistent with the observations for DWDs more distant than 500 pc. These results highlight how LISA's observations of DWDs will provide invaluable information on aspects of stellar evolution such as mass transfer and CEEs, which will allow theoretical models to be better constrained.</description>

      <title>A numerical approach for modelling the polarisation signals of strong resonance lines with partial frequency redistribution. Numerical applications to two-term atoms and plane-parallel atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The main goal of this paper is to present an accurate and efficient numerical strategy for solving the radiative transfer problem for polarised radiation in strong resonance lines forming out of local thermodynamic equilibrium, taking angle-dependent (AD) partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects and J-state interference into account. We consider the polarisation produced both by the Zeeman effect and by the scattering of anisotropic radiation, along with its sensitivity to the Hanle and magneto-optical effects. Methods. We introduce a formalism that allows treating both a two-level and a two-term atom in the presence of arbitrary magnetic and bulk velocity fields. The problem is formulated by treating the population of the lower level/term as a fixed input parameter. This approach makes the problem linear with respect to the radiation field, enabling the application of efficient matrix-free preconditioned iterative methods for its solution. Additionally, the computation of the scattering emissivity in the comoving frame, together with a careful choice of the angular and spectral quadrature nodes, allow us to speed up the calculations by reducing the number of evaluations of the redistribution functions. Results. The proposed solution strategy is applied to synthesise the Stokes profiles of the Mg ii h&amp;k doublet and the H i Ly-{\alpha} line in 1D semi-empirical models. The results demonstrate that the method is both fast and accurate. A comparison with calculations from HanleRT-TIC displays an overall good agreement, thereby validating our solution strategy. Moreover, for the wavelength-integrated polarisation profiles of the H i Ly-{\alpha} line, we find an excellent agreement between the results obtained including PRD effects in their general AD description and those obtained considering the angle-averaged simplifying approximation.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of acoustic-wave heating in simulations of the quiet Sun chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding energy transfer through the chromosphere is paramount to solving the coronal heating problem. We investigated the energy dissipation of acoustic waves in the chromosphere of the quiet Sun using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) simulations. We analysed the characteristics of acoustic-wave heating and its dependence on height and magnetic field configuration. We find the typical heights where acoustic waves steepen into shocks and the frequencies and wavenumbers that most efficiently dissipate wave energy through this steepening. We combined a comprehensive large-scale analysis, spanning the entirety of the simulations for several solar hours, with a detailed view of an individual shock. We find that the flux of propagating acoustic waves correlates closely with viscous dissipation in the chromosphere above the temperature minimum. Acoustic waves with frequencies close to the acoustic cut-off frequency can efficiently heat the quiet Sun chromosphere at the plasma-$\beta$ = 1 interface and play an important role in the chromospheric energy balance.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Field on the Accretion Phase of Population III Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of the magnetic field on Population III star formation by varying the magnetic field strength. We perform simulations with magnetic field strengths ranging from $10^{-20}$ G to $10^{-4}$ G, in addition to a model without a magnetic field. The simulations are run for $&gt;1000-1400$ yr after the first protostar forms. In weak-field models, the surrounding disk fragments, forming multiple protostars, and the magnetic field is amplified by the orbital motion and rotation of these protostars. In the model without a magnetic field, frequent fragmentation occurs, and the most massive protostar reaches $\sim200 M_\odot$. However, in models with a magnetic field, once the magnetic field is amplified, the protostars merge to form a single massive protostar, and no further fragmentation occurs except in the model with the strongest magnetic field. Even after the formation of the single protostar, the magnetic field continues to amplify, leading to the formation of a thick disk supported by magnetic pressure and a global spiral pattern. In models with moderate or strong magnetic fields, a rotating disk can form, but fragmentation does not occur, and a strong magnetic field drives an outflow. However, the range of parameters for both disk formation and outflow driving is very narrow, making their appearance under realistic conditions unlikely. Given the weak magnetic field in the early universe, Population III stars are expected to form as single stars, surrounded by a thick disk with a spiral pattern. Thus, the magnetic field, regardless of its strength, plays a crucial role in Population III star formation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux cancellation in a flux-emergence magnetohydrodynamics simulation of coronal hole eruptions and jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for signatures of magnetic flux cancellation in a 3D resistive MHD flux-emergence simulation of coronal jets and eruptions in a coronal-hole-like environment. To do this, we analysed the output from a 3D MHD simulation of an emerging twisted horizontal flux tube from the convection zone into the solar atmosphere. The simulation considered the impact of neutral hydrogen on the magnetic induction equation, that is, it employed partially ionised plasma. Standard and blowout jets as well as eruptions were observed during the simulation. We observe clear evidence of magnetic flux cancellation in a short segment along the internal polarity-inversion line (iPIL) of the photospheric Bz during an extended period of the simulation characterised by eruptions and blowout jets. Converging magnetic footpoint motions at ~ 1 km/s carried sheared fields within the magnetic tails of the emerging flux tube towards the iPIL. These fields reconnect at the iPIL and generate concave-upward and slowly rising field lines causing a flux decrease that is associated with magnetic flux cancellation. We show evidence of magnetic flux cancellation in 3D MHD simulations of coronal hole eruptions and jets associated with an emerging twisted flux tube. The magnetic flux cancellation can be traced up to about 520 km above the photosphere and might contribute to the formation of pre-eruptive magnetic flux rope seeds. Although our results are consistent with several basic aspects of magnetic flux-cancellation observations associated with coronal jets, the observations nevertheless also suggest that cancellation involves much larger fractions of the available flux than our numerical simulation. We supply avenues to address this discrepancy in future work.</description>

      <title>Rapid binary mass transfer: Circumbinary outflows and angular momentum losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that escapes the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include any radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10 to 30 degrees with a wind-like density profile $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for binary mass ratios $q$ (accretor/donor) of {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2}. The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for $q=0.25$ where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that will interact with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.</description>

      <title>Classifying the derivatives of light curves for overcontact eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the physical properties of eclipsing binaries can be extracted from the derivatives of their light curves. A classification scheme for the derivatives of light curves would be helpful for identifying key characteristics of eclipsing binaries. In this study, we propose a new classification method for the light curves of overcontact eclipsing binaries by using their derivatives. We synthesized 89,670 sample light curves of overcontact binaries and categorized them into five types on the basis of their first to fourth derivatives. For each type, we examined the statistical distributions of four parameters: the mass ratio, orbital inclination, fill-out factor, and eclipse obscuration. Their distributions demonstrated that parameter values exhibit certain trends depending on the classified types. With the proposed classification method, general properties of overcontact binaries can be understood, providing a foundation for further detailed analysis.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Ray Acceleration Mechanism Based on Background Flow Velocity Inhomogeneities Yielding Power-Law Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, momentum transport generated by the combined effects of pitch-angle diffusion and Background Flow Velocity Inhomogeneities (BFVIs) is proposed to obtain a cosmic rays acceleration mechanism, starting from the well-known focusing equation describing particle diffusion and acceleration. The inhomogeneities of background flow velocity is ubiquitous in astrophysical environment. The isotropic distribution function equation of charged energetic particles is derived, and its solution is obtained, demonstrating the form of momentum power laws of cosmic rays. In addition, if it is assumed that cosmic rays penetrate compressible plasma waves or turbulence, for quasi-steady states, the spectral index $\delta$ of the momentum power law spectrum of cosmic rays is found to be in the range $[-5, -3]$, which includes the observed power law indices of galactic cosmic rays. The results obtained in this article demonstrate that the mechanism proposed in this article, along with shock acceleration, may also contribute to the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays. Furthermore, when momentum convection effect and higher-order momentum derivative terms are considered, the indices of power laws should be smaller than $-5$. This may explain the power laws of solar energetic particle events.</description>

      <title>The Paris Meudon ground based support to the NASA Solar Maximum Mission in the eighties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Maximum Mission of NASA was one of the first satellites with on board digitization of observations. It was launched for the solar maximum of cycle 21 (1980) in order to study the solar activity. It carried many instruments, such as coronagraphs, X and $\gamma$ ray detectors, an Ultra Violet spectrometer and a radiometer. Ground based support was offered by many institutes, such as Paris Meudon observatory under the form of systematic observations or coordinated campaigns with specific instruments. We present here the Meudon Solar Tower (MST) and magnetograph which offered in the eighties a major contribution with observations of velocity and magnetic fields of the photosphere and chromosphere, while SMM was observing the transition region and corona above.</description>

Abstract: Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.</description>

      <title>Ten Aligned Orbits: Planet Migration in the Era of JWST and Ariel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the diverse formation and migration pathways that shape exoplanetary systems requires characterizing both their atmospheric properties and their orbital dynamics. A key dynamical diagnostic is the projected spin-orbit angle - the alignment between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit-which provides crucial tests for theoretical models. This angle can be determined using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Although measurements exist for over 200 planets, the overall distribution of these angles is not fully understood, motivating further observations across the full parameter space. We analyze archival HARPS and HARPS-N spectroscopic transit time series of nine gas giant exoplanets on short orbits and one brown dwarf. We derive their projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$. We find aligned projected orbits for all nine gas giants as well as the brown dwarf. Furthermore, we are able to derive the true spin-orbit angle for the brown dwarf EPIC 219388192b, $\psi = $25$^{+11}_{-14}$ deg. These projected prograde orbits are consistent with quiet disc migration disfavoring violent events exciting the orbits in the history of these systems. Finally, we investigate the current overlap between spin-orbit angle measurements and atmospheric characterization targets. While we find no strong observational biases due to the spin-orbit angle, we note that the majority of planets with atmospheric data still lack spin-orbit measurements. This incompleteness of the dynamical information may limit the interpretation of upcoming atmospheric surveys.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Structural Properties of Anisotropic Dark Matter-Admixed Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic compact stars comprising two non-interacting fluids: quark matter and condensed dark matter. Using the MIT Bag model equation of state for quark matter and Bose-Einstein Condensate equation of state for dark matter, we numerically compute interior solutions for those two-fluid component spherical configurations. Varying the initial central density ratio of dark matter to quark matter, we examine how different proportions of these components influence the mass-radius profile, the factor of compactness as well as the quark mass fraction. Recent studies suggest that quark matter may exist in the cores of massive neutron stars, significantly affecting their structure and stability. We calculate the factor of compactness for both negative and positive anisotropy cases explored in this article. Our findings demonstrate that dark matter-admixed quark stars are more compact yet less massive compared to pure quark matter stars, aligning with recent theoretical predictions and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Continuous Habitable Zone Metric for Prioritizing Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future direct imaging space telescopes, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will be the first capable of both detecting and characterizing terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones (HZ) of nearby Sun-like stars. Since this will require a significant amount of time and resources for even a single system or exoplanet, the likelihood that a system will host detectable life should be considered when prioritizing observations. One method of prioritization is to estimate the likelihood that an exoplanet has remained continuously within the HZ long enough for life to emerge and make a detectable impact on the atmosphere. We utilize a Bayesian method to calculate the likelihood that a given orbital radius around a star is currently in the 2 Gyr continuous habitable zone (CHZ$_2$), the approximate time it took life on Earth to significantly oxygenate the atmosphere. We apply this method to the 164 stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Mission Star List (EMSL) for HWO, representing a preliminary sample of Sun-like stars with HZs most accessible to a future direct imaging mission. By considering the CHZ$_2$ likelihood at all orbital radii outside a hypothetical inner working angle for HWO, we define a metric for prioritizing targets according to the accessibility and total extent of the CHZ$_2$. We find that the CHZ$_2$ metric peaks between $3-4$ Gyr for late-F and early-G dwarfs, but tentatively determine that stars earlier than $\sim {F3}$ or hotter than $\sim 6600$ K are unlikely to have a CHZ$_2$ at the time of observation.</description>

      <title>Proposal for the optical design of three robust and highly performing FPI systems for the European Solar Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a proposal for the optical design of three dual Fabry-Perot based narrowband filter systems for for the future European Solar Telescope (EST). These are intended to constitute the core elements of three imaging spectropolarimeters, foreseen to become amongst the most important science instruments for EST. The designs proposed here rely heavily on the heritage of CRISP and CHROMIS, developed for the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and described in detail in a companion paper (Scharmer et al. 2025, in prep.). The outstanding performance of these systems, and the simplicity of their designs, provide strong support of our proposal to build similar systems for EST. The design concepts involve i) minimising the FPI clear aperture diameter by means of numerical simulations based on constraints on Strehl and spectral resolution set by the EST Science Advisory Group (SAG); ii) a compact telecentric optical design with an optical path length of less than 4.7 m; iii) a straight-through optical system based on lenses and without any folding mirrors; iv) the combination of a high resolution etalon with high reflectivity and a low reflectivity, low resolution etalon, to mitigate the effects of cavity errors (Scharmer 2006, Scharmer et al. 2025); v) flexibility in terms of image scale by simple replacement of the last lens (the camera lens) of the FPI system. We propose to compensate for the focus curve of ESTs Pier Optical Path (POP) by focusing the camera lenses of the FPI systems. s.
  The proposed systems should offer several advantages over other much more complex systems, including manufacture, alignment, stability, flexibility of changes of image scale, and costs. The underlying design concepts also make the proposed FPI systems robust and highly performing in terms of image quality, overall transmission, and fidelity of the spectral transmission profile.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Ephemerides Change Observations (ExoEcho). II. Transit timing variation analysis of Brown Dwarfs around Solar-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transit timing variation (TTV) is a useful tool for studying the orbital properties of transiting objects. However, few TTV studies have been done on transiting brown dwarfs (BDs) around solar-type stars. Here we study the long-term TTV of a population of close BD companions around solar-type stars using TESS data. We use the measured orbital period change rate to constrain the tidal interaction strength between the host star and the BD companion and put limits on the destruction timescale of these transiting BDs. However, we find no statistically significant evidence of orbital decay or expansion in our sample based on the current data. This may be due to either poor observational data or inherently weak tidal dissipation. We then perform simulations to investigate future observation strategies for detecting orbital decay of transiting BDs, which show NGTS-7A b, TOI-263~b and LP 261-75 b are the most promising targets in the next few years. Our study demonstrates the potential of TTV technique to probe the formation and evolution of close BD companions around solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Spectral Evolution of Rotating Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from primordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through their influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the formation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct detection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational capabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic lensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to observable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models for their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar populations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties of non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we expand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and post-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and magnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for isolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while rotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent evolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones potentially visible with only moderate lensing.</description>

      <title>The Role of High-mass Stellar Binaries in the Formation of High-mass Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) with pre-merger source-frame individual masses in the so-called upper mass-gap, expected due to (pulsational) pair instability supernova ((P)PISN), have created immense interest in the astrophysical production of high-mass black holes (BHs). Previous studies show that high-mass BHs may be produced via repeated BBH mergers inside dense star clusters. Alternatively, inside dense star clusters, stars with unusually low core-to-envelope mass ratios can form via mergers of high-mass stars, which then can avoid (P)PISN, but produce high-mass BHs via mass fallback. We simulate detailed star-by-star multi-physics models of dense star clusters using the Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, CMC, to investigate the role of primordial binary fraction among high-mass stars (&gt;=15 Msun) on the formation of high-mass BHs. We vary the high-mass stellar binary fraction (fb_15_prime) while keeping all other initial properties, including the population of high-mass stars, unchanged. We find that the number of high-mass BHs, as well as the mass of the most massive BH formed via stellar core-collapse are proportional to fb_15_prime. In contrast, there is no correlation between fb_15_prime and the number of high-mass BHs formed via BH-BH mergers. Since the total production of high-mass BHs is dominated by BH-BH mergers in old clusters, the overall number of high-mass BHs produced over the typical lifetime of globular clusters is insensitive to fb_15_prime. We study the differences in the demographics of BH-BH mergers and their implications for the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra detections as a function of fb_15_prime.</description>

      <title>Proton Flux Measurement from Neutron Monitor Data Using Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of cosmic ray proton flux are essential for studying the modulation processes of cosmic rays during the solar activity cycle. A proton flux measurement method, based on ground-based neutron monitor (NM) data and deep learning techniques, is presented. After the necessary pre-processing of ground-based NM data using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we simulate the relationship between NM observations and proton flux measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). The daily proton flux data, ranging from 1 GV to 100 GV, are obtained for the period from 2011 to 2024, showing strong agreement with the observed values. In addition, daily proton flux measurements are provided for periods when AMS data were unavailable due to operational reasons. For the first time, hourly proton fluxes as a function of rigidity are calculated dedicated to the short-time solar activity studies.</description>

      <title>Radiative-transfer models for dusty Type II supernovae</title>

Abstract: Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical dimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the dust location and amount impact observations, we computed ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type II SNe using state-of-the-art models -- for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron silicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both radioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year, approximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad, asymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which obscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a more modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts of the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as SN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be optically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order 1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta has negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In noninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially quenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the emission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII emission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches closely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe requires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple power sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.</description>
