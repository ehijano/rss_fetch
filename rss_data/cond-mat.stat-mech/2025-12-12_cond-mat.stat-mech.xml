      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo in Classical Phase Space with the Wigner-Kirkwood Commutation Function. Results for the Saturation Liquid Density of $^4$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is given for the case of a complex phase space weight, which applies generally in quantum statistical mechanics. Computer simulations using Lennard-Jones $^4$He near the $\lambda$-transition, including an expansion to third order of the Wigner-Kirkwood commutation function, give a saturation liquid density in agreement with measured values.</description>

      <title>Statistical Field Theory of Interacting Nambu Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a statistical field theory for classical Nambu dynamics by employing partially the method of quantum field theory. One of unsolved problems in Nambu dynamics has been to extend it to interacting systems without violating a generalized canonical structure associated with the presence of multiple Hamiltonians, which together govern the dynamics of time evolution with an equal footing. In the present paper, we propose to include interactions from the standpoint of classical statistical dynamics by formulating it as a field theory on Nambu's generalized phase space in an operator formalism. We first construct a general framework for such a field theory and its probabilistic interpretation. Then, on the basis of this new framework, we give a simple model of self-interaction in a many-body Nambu system treated as a closed dynamical system satisfying the H-theorem. It is shown that a generalized micro-canonical ensemble and a generalized canonical ensemble characterized by many temperatures are reached dynamically as equilibrium states, starting with certain classes of initial non-equilibrium states via continuous Markov processes. Compared with the usual classical statistical mechanics on the basis of standard Hamiltonian dynamics, some important new features associated with Nambu dynamics will emerge, with respect to the symmetries underlying dynamics of the non-equilibrium as well as the equilibrium states and also to some conceptual properties, such as a formulation of a generalized KMS-like condition characterizing the generalized canonical equilibrium states and a `relative' nature of the temperatures.</description>

      <title>Universal relaxation speedup in open quantum systems through transient conditional and unconditional resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speeding up the relaxation dynamics of many-body quantum systems is important in a variety of contexts, including quantum computation and state preparation. We demonstrate that such acceleration can be universally achieved via transient stochastic resetting. This means that during an initial time interval of finite duration, the dynamics is interrupted by resets that take the system to a designated state at randomly selected times. We illustrate this idea for few-body open systems and also for a challenging many-body case, where a first-order phase transition leads to a divergence of relaxation time. In all scenarios, a significant and sometimes even exponential acceleration in reaching the stationary state is observed, similar to the so-called Mpemba effect. The universal nature of this speedup lies in the fact that the design of the resetting protocol only requires knowledge of a few macroscopic properties of the target state, such as the order parameter of the phase transition, while it does not necessitate any fine-tuned manipulation of the initial state.</description>

      <title>Bose one-component plasma in 2D: a Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-temperature properties of a 2D Bose fluid of charged particles interacting through a 1/r potential, moving in the presence of a uniform neutralizing background, is studied by Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We make use of the Modified Periodic Coulomb potential formalism to account for the long-range character of the interaction, and explore a range of density corresponding to average interparticle separation $1 \le r_s\le 80$. We report numerical results based on simulations of system comprising up to 2304 particles. We find a superfluid ground state for $r_s$ as large as 68, i.e., slightly above the most recent numerical estimate of the Wigner crystallization threshold, which we estimate at $r_W \approx 70$. Furthermore, no thermally re-entrant crystalline phase nor any evidence of metastable bubbles is observed near the transition, in contrast with a previous theoretical study in which quantum statistics was neglected. The computed superfluid transition temperature depends remarkably weakly on density.</description>

      <title>Discreteness-induced spatial chaos versus fluctuation-induced spatial order in stochastic Turing pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Turing pattern formation in a stochastic reaction-diffusion model defined on $N$ lattice sites, where each lattice site is associated with a reaction vessel of volume $\Omega$. We focus on a regime where spatial discreteness plays a crucial role, namely when the characteristic length of patterns is comparable to the lattice spacing. In this setting, we compare two different limiting procedures and show that they lead to qualitatively different outcomes. If we first take the deterministic limit $\Omega \to \infty$ and then the long-time limit $t \to \infty$, the stationary solutions of the corresponding spatially discrete deterministic equations become spatially chaotic in the limit $N\to\infty$. In contrast, if we first take the limit $t \to \infty$ and then take an appropriate limit of $\Omega \to \infty$ and $N\to\infty$, the resulting patterns are spatially periodic.</description>

      <title>Janus Percolation in Anisotropic Limited-Degree Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world infrastructures, from sensor and road networks to power grids, are spatially embedded and anisotropic, with constraints on the maximum number of links each node can establish. Such systems can be represented as anisotropic limited-degree networks, in which each node forms at most q outgoing links preferentially oriented along a fixed direction. By increasing the node density sigma at fixed q, we uncover a reentrant percolation transition: a giant strongly connected component emerges, but unexpectedly disintegrates again at high densities. This counterintuitive behavior implies that adding nodes, normally expected to enhance robustness, can instead reduce mutual accessibility and weaken global connectivity. The critical behavior displays two coexisting "faces": random-percolation scaling along the preferred direction and directed-percolation scaling transversely, therefore we name this phenomenon Janus percolation, in analogy with the dual-faced Roman god. These findings demonstrate that anisotropy and degree limitation can jointly induce a novel reentrant connectivity with mixed universality that bridges the universality classes of random and directed percolation, providing fresh insight into how structural constraints shape connectivity and resilience in spatial networks.</description>

      <title>Multiloop calculations with parametric integration in critical dynamics: the four-loop analytic study of model A of $\phi^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an analytical four loop calculation of exponent $z$ in model A of critical dynamics in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. This is the first time such a large order of perturbation theory has been calculated analytically for models of critical dynamics. To do this, we apply the modern method of parametrical integration with hyperlogaritms. We discuss in detail peculiarities of application of this method to critical dynamics, e.g. the problem of linear-irreducible diagrams already present in four loop (contrary to statics where the first linear-irreducible diagram appears in six loop).</description>

      <title>Planckian Bounds via Spectral Moments of Optical Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of Planckian scattering, often inferred from Drude fits in strongly correlated metals, raises the question of how to extract an intrinsic timescale from measurable quantities in a model-independent way. We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Deep Thermalization and Measurements of Quantum Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.</description>

      <title>Detailed balance in large language model-driven agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.</description>

      <title>The von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ and the DSSYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double-scaling limit of the SYK (DSSYK) model is known to possess an underlying $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ quantum group symmetry. In this paper, we provide, for the first time, a von Neumann algebraic quantum group-theoretical description of the degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the DSSYK model. In particular, we construct the operator-algebraic quantum Gauss decomposition for the von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e. the $q$-deformation of the normaliser of $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and derive the Casimir action on its quantum homogeneous spaces. We then show that the dynamics on quantum AdS$_{2,q}$ space reduces to that of the DSSYK model. Furthermore, we argue that the extension of the global symmetry group to its normaliser is not only necessary for a consistent definition of the locally compact quantum group, but that, moreover, the reduction to the DSSYK model works exclusively at the level of the normaliser. The von Neumann algebraic description is shown to give a natural restriction on the allowed quantised coordinates, elegantly ensuring length positivity and non-negative integer chord numbers. Lastly, we make remarks on the correlation function related to the strange series representation, which is argued to interpolate between the AdS and dS regions of our $q$-homogeneous space.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Multi-Species Driven Diffusive Systems with Open Boundaries: A Two-Tasep Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we review a recently developed method for analysing multi-component driven diffusive systems with open boundaries. The approach generalises the extremal-current principle known for single-component models and is based on solving the Riemann problem for the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. As a case study, we focus on a two-species exclusion process on a lattice (Two-TASEP), where two types of particles move in opposite directions with two arbitrary rates and exchange positions upon encounter with a third rate. Despite its simplicity, this toy model effectively captures the key features of multi-species driven diffusive systems, including phase separation phenomena. This allows us to illustrate the critical role played by the underlying Riemann invariants in determining the system's macroscopic behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A partially parallel dynamical noisy binary choice (Ising) game in discrete time of $N$ players on complete graphs with $k$ players having a possibility of changing their strategies at each time moment called $k$-flip Ising game is considered. Analytical calculation of the transition matrix of game as well as the first two moments of the distribution of $\varphi=N^+/N$, where $N^+$ is a number of players adhering to one of the two strategies, is presented. First two moments of the first hitting time distribution for sample trajectories corresponding to transition from a metastable and unstable states to a stable one are considered. A nontrivial dependence of these moments on $k$ for the decay of a metastable state is discussed. A presence of the minima at certain $k^*$ is attributed to a competition between $k$-dependent diffusion and restoring forces.</description>

      <title>Diagonal boundary conditions in critical loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.</description>

      <title>Chaos, Entanglement and Measurement: Field-Theoretic Perspectives on Quantum Information Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops tools to understand how quantum information spreads, scrambles, and is reshaped by measurements in many-body systems. First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics study of surface-directed spinodal decomposition on a chemically patterned amorphous substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a molecular dynamics (MD) study to explore pattern selection in binary fluid mixtures ($AB$) undergoing surface-directed spinodal decomposition on a chemically patterned amorphous substrate. We chose a checkerboard pattern with chemically distinct square patches of a side $M$, with neighboring patches preferring different particle types. We report the efficient transposition of the substrate's pattern as a \emph{registry} to the fluid cross sections in its vicinity when the pattern's periodicity $\lambda/\sigma \simeq 2M$ ($\sigma$ being the fluid particle size) is larger than the mixture's spinodal length scale $\lambda_c/\sigma \simeq 2\pi/\xi_B$ ($\xi_B$ being the bulk correlation length). Our correlation analysis between the surface field and the surface-\emph{registries} in the substrate's normal direction shows that the associated decay length, $L_{\perp}(t)$, increases with decreasing pattern periodicity ($\lambda$). $L_{\perp}(t)$ also exhibits diffusive growth with time $\sim t^{1/3}$, similar to wetting-layer growth for chemically homogeneous walls. Our MD results also show the emergence of composition waves parallel to the substrate, whose wavelength exhibits dynamical scaling with a power-law growth in time $L_{||}(z,t)\sim t^{\alpha}$. $L_{||}(z,t)$ shows dynamical crossovers from a transient \emph{surface-registry} regime to universal \emph{phase-separation} regimes for cross-sections with \emph{registries}. We also give an account of the scaling of \emph{registry's} formation and melting times with patch sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inviscid, partial differential equations of hydrodynamics when projected via a Galerkin-truncation on a finite-dimensional subspace spanning wavenumbers $-{\bf K}_{\rm G} \le {\bf k} \le {\bf K}_{\rm G}$, and hence retaining a finite number of modes $N_{\rm G}$, lead to absolute equilibrium states. We review how the Galerkin-truncated, three-dimensional, incompressible Euler equation thermalises and its connection to questions in turbulence. We also discuss an emergent pseudo-dissipation range in the energy spectrum and the time-scales associated with thermalisation.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and positivity of Green's functions without Lorentz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties imposed by microcausality and positivity on the retarded two-point Green's function in a theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We assume invariance under time and spatial translations, so that the Green's function $G$ depends on $\omega$ and $\vec k$. We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\Im (\omega,\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(\omega,\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $\omega \cdot \Im G(\omega,\vec k) \ge 0$ for real $(\omega,\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\Im [\omega\, G(\omega,\vec k)] &gt;0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $\epsilon(\omega,k)$ and $\mu^{-1}(\omega,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium. We verify the above properties in several examples where Lorentz invariance is broken by a background field, e.g. non-zero chemical potential, or non-zero temperature. We study subtracted dispersion relations when the assumption $G \to 0$ at infinity must be relaxed.</description>

      <title>Shaping chaos in bilayer graphene cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities, where electrons are confined in finite graphene flakes, provide a suitable platform to study quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems due to the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates (EPRs) in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability-flow equivalence technique, we rigorously obtain an entropy production (EP) decomposition formula. We demonstrate that the EP, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem, $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)/\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(-\Sigma)=e^{\Sigma}$, which holds for the distribution $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)$ defined as the probability of observing a value $\Sigma$ of the quantity $\mathcal{R}\equiv \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}-B_\mathrm{act}$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with active fluctuations. Moreover, an integral fluctuation theorem, $\langle e^{- \mathcal{R} } \rangle = 1$, and the generalized second law of thermodynamics, $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot} \rangle \ge \langle B_\mathrm{act} \rangle$, follow directly. Our results hold under steady-state conditions and can be straightforwardly extended to arbitrary initial states. In the limiting case where active fluctuations vanish, these theorems reduce to the established results of stochastic thermodynamics. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce a deep-learning-based methodology for efficiently computing the EP, utilizing the L\'{e}vy score we propose. To illustrate the validity of our approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer composed of an active Brownian cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our work provides a unified framework for analyzing EP in active matter and offers practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accumulation of self-propelled particles on repulsive barriers is a widely observed feature in active matter. Despite being implicated in a broad range of biological processes, from biofilm formation to cytoskeletal movement, wetting of surfaces by active particles remains poorly understood. In this work, we study this active wetting by considering a model comprising an active lattice gas, interacting with a permeable barrier under periodic boundary conditions, for which an exact hydrodynamic description is possible. We consider a hydrodynamic scaling limit that eliminates dynamical noise while retaining microscopic interpretability, enabling a precise characterisation of steady-states and their transitions. We demonstrate that the accumulation of active particles has remarkable similarities to equilibrium wetting, and that active wetting transitions display all the salient characteristics of the equilibrium critical wetting transition -- despite fundamental differences in underlying microscopic dynamics. However, our framework also enables the investigation of subtle but important nonequilibrium effects in active wetting, including a spontaneous ratchet effect which leads to a global steady-state current, departure of bulk densities from their binodal values, and a novel dynamical transition pathway. Our results provide an intrinsically nonequilibrium framework in which to study active wetting, precisely demonstrating the connection to passive wetting while clarifying the nonequilibrium consequences of activity.</description>

      <title>Time crystalline solitons and their stochastic dynamics in a driven-dissipative \phi^4 model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems provide unique opportunities to investigate the dynamics of topological excitations far from equilibrium. In this paper, we report a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\phi^4$ model. This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational symmetry while simultaneously displaying spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined despite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged annihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical phase transitions have proven to be a powerful concept to capture the phenomenology of many systems, including deeply non-equilibrium ones like living systems. The study of these phase transitions has overwhelmingly relied on two-point correlation functions. In this Letter, we show that cluster tomography -- the study of one-dimensional cross-sections of the clusters that emerge near a phase transition -- is an alternative higher-order tool that efficiently locates and characterizes phase transitions in active systems. First, using motility-induced phase separation as a paradigmatic example, we show how complex geometric features of clusters, captured by spatial cluster tomography, can be used to measure critical exponents in active systems without explicitly introducing system-specific order parameters. Second, we introduce temporal cluster tomography, an analogous cluster-based measurement that characterizes the dynamical behavior of active systems. We show that cluster dynamics can be captured by a generalization of burstiness analysis in complex temporal networks. Both spatial and temporal cluster tomography are easy to implement yet powerful approaches to study non-equilibrium systems, making them useful additions to the standard toolbox of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed, and enables quantitative assessment of quantum effects in noble gases such as helium, neon, and argon. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.</description>

Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse independently but are simultaneously reset whenever any of them reaches a fixed threshold located at $L &gt; 0$. For any $N &gt; 2$, the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) at long-times with strong long-range correlations. These correlations emerge purely from the dynamics, and not from built-in interactions. Despite being strongly correlated, the NESS has a solvable structure that allows for an exact computation of several physical observables, both global and local. These include the average density profile, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th ordered particles, the distribution of the gap between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval around the origin.</description>

      <title>Dynamic hysteresis and transitions controlled by asymmetry in potential barrier shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study unveils the precise role of the underlying potential in regulating the fundamental processes of dynamic hysteresis, which manifests in numerous natural and designed systems. We identify that it is possible to induce symmetry breaking in dynamic hysteresis, and consequently to observe dynamic transitions under moderate conditions, which is absent for the symmetric case, if appropriate asymmetry is implemented in the design of the underlying potential. This kind of asymmetry appears through the disparate widths of the two wells of the intrinsic bistable potential governing the dynamics and the barrier separating them. It is characteristically distinct from the potential in which the two minima are energetically dissimilar. Our understanding suggests that only the intrinsic asymmetry of the former type can substantially influence the elemental dynamics of the processes to generate significant effects on the outcomes. Our study presents a novel approach to quantitatively regulate the outputs, to increase or decrease the extent of dynamic hysteresis, based on the requirements, by effectively controlling the proper asymmetry of the intrinsic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLSE) exhibits a transition from ergodic, delocalized dynamics to a weakly nonergodic regime characterized by breather formation; yet, a precise characterization of this transition has remained elusive. By sampling many microcanonically equivalent initial conditions, we identify the asymptotic ensemble variance of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy as a dynamical order parameter that vanishes in the ergodic phase and becomes finite once ergodicity is broken. The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quench dynamics of glassy systems are challenging. Due to aging, the system never reaches a stationary state but instead evolves on emergent scales that grow with its age. This slow evolution complicates field-theoretic descriptions, as the weak long-term memory and the absence of a stationary state hinder simplifications of the memory, always leading to the worst-case scaling of computational effort with the cubic power of the simulated time. Here, we present an algorithm based on two-dimensional interpolations of Green's functions, which resolves this issue and achieves sublinear scaling of computational cost. We apply it to the quench dynamics of the spherical mixed $p$-spin model to establish the existence of a phase transition between glasses with strong and weak ergodicity breaking at a finite temperature of the initial state. By reaching times three orders of magnitude larger than previously attainable, we determine the critical exponents of this transition. Interestingly, these are continuously varying and, therefore, non-universal. While we introduce and validate the method in the context of a glassy system, it is equally applicable to any model with overdamped excitations.</description>

      <title>Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling Dynamics of Diffusion-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion generative models: each simulated sampling trajectory along the gradient field lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical boomerang shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing deterministic numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only 5 - 10 function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility for extremely low external fluctuations and critical behaviour of Greenberg-Hastings neuronal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.</description>

      <title>Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a systematic characterization of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks within the quenched mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Universal Critical Scaling and Phase Diagram of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect under Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard scaling theory dictates that disorder leads to immediate localization in one-dimensional Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology fundamentally alters this paradigm, protecting transport up to a substantial critical disorder strength. By employing a numerically stable log-space transfer matrix approach up to thermodynamic scales (N=1000), we identify a sharp phase transition from the topological skin phase to the Anderson localized phase. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that this transition belongs to a unique universality class with critical exponents \nu\approx1.50 and \beta\approx0.65. Furthermore, we map the global phase diagram, confirming that the critical disorder scales as W_c\propto\sqrt\gamma, consistent with localization suppression by an imaginary vector potential. Our results establish the rigorous limits of non-Hermitian topological protection in imperfect media.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>
