      <title>Grothendieck topologies with logarithmic modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many concepts in logarithmic geometry are invariant under log blowups. To formalize this invariance, we introduce the m-open, m-\'etale, m-smooth, m-fppf, and m-fpqc topologies for fs log schemes. These refine the standard topologies from scheme theory by treating log modifications as covers. In constructing them, we identify and correct errors in the definitions of log modifications and the full log \'etale topology. Our m-topologies are variants of those introduced by Niziol and Park; specifically, the m-\'etale topology is a subtopology of Kato's full log \'etale topology, characterized by a stronger lifting property than for log \'etale maps. This strengthening ensures the functoriality of the corresponding small site. We also characterize the sheaves for all these sites and connect the m-open site to Kato's valuative space.</description>

      <title>Deformation of nef adjoint canonical line bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much inspired by J. A. Wi\'sniewski's nef-value function method, we prove that in a smooth projective family over the unit disk, if the adjoint bundle of the canonical line bundle with a relatively semiample line bundle is nef on one fiber, then it remains nef on all fibers. We further extend this result to the semiampleness of the adjoint canonical line bundles. Using these, we prove the deformation invariance of any generalized plurigenera by assuming that only one fiber admits the semiample canonical line bundle and improve the first author--Xiao-Lei Liu's recent deformation rigidity of projective manifolds with semiample canonical line bundles. In particular, also by E. Viehweg--K. Zuo's result on the minimal number of singular fibers in a family and the first author--X. Liu's isotriviality result, if a projective family over $\mathbb{P}^1$ or an elliptic curve has one fiber with the big and nef (or more generally semiample) canonical line bundle, then all fibers are isomorphic to this fiber.
  Next, much inspired by M. Andreatta--T. Peternell's deformation theoretical approach, we prove that, in a smooth K\"ahler family of threefolds, if the canonical line bundle of one fiber is not nef, then none of its small deformations admits a nef canonical line bundle either. This partially confirms a problem posed by F. Campana--T. Peternell and the global stability of semiampleness of canonical line bundles of threefolds under a K\"ahler smooth deformation.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of hyperkahler manifolds and the Hu-Yau conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wierzba and Wisniewski proved that in dimension 4, every bimeromorphic map of hyperkahler manifolds is represented as a composition of Mukai flops. Hu and Yau conjectured that this result can be generalized to arbitrary dimension. They defined ``Mukai's elementary transformation'' as the blow-up of a subvariety ruled by complex projective spaces, composed with the contraction of the ruling. Hu and Yau conjectured that any bimeromorphic map of hyperkahler manifolds can be decomposed into a sequence of Mukai's elementary transformations, after possibly removing subvarieties of codimension greater than $2$. We prove this conjecture for compact hyperkahler manifolds of maximal holonomy by decomposing any bimeromorphic map into a composition of wall-crossing flops associated with MBM contractions.</description>

      <title>Fibration theorems for varieties with the weak Hilbert property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak Hilbert property (WHP) for varieties over fields of characteristic zero was introduced by Corvaja and Zannier in 2017. There exist integral variants of WHP for arithmetic schemes. We present new fibration theorems for both the WHP and its integral analogue. Our primary fibration result, in a sense dual to the mixed fibration theorems of Javanpeykar and Luger, establishes for a smooth proper morphism $f: Y \to Z$ of smooth connected varieties, that if $Z$ has the strong Hilbert property (HP) and the generic fiber has WHP, then the total space $Y$ also has WHP. As an application, we use this result in combination with previous work by Corvaja, Demeio, Javanpeykar, Lombardo, and Zannier and in combination with recent work of Javanpeykar to show that certain non-constant abelian schemes over HP varieties possess WHP. For integral WHP, we prove a new fibration theorem for proper smooth morphisms with a section, which generalizes earlier product theorems of Luger and of Corvaja, Demeio, Javanpeykar, Lombardo, and Zannier. A key lemma gives information about the structure of covers of $Y$ whose branch locus is not dominat over $Z$.</description>

      <title>A virtual structure for symplectic Higgs bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a virtual structure for a moduli of symplectic Higgs sheaves $(E,\phi)$ on projective surfaces $S$. Key to this is a minimality assumption on $\textrm{ch}(E)$ that forces all $E$ to be locally free. This might have implications to define a virtual count and $Sp(r)$-Vafa-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of representations of quivers with multiplicities via non-reductive GIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new moduli spaces of quiver representations with multiplicities, i.e. over rings of truncated power series. This includes moduli of framed representations and analogues of Nakajima quiver varieties. Our construction relies on tools from relative affine Geometric Invariant Theory for non-reductive groups and new stability conditions for quiver representations with multiplicities. We also study the cohomology of smooth moduli spaces of quiver representations with multiplicities, and show that several of these moduli spaces are cohomologically pure, using torus actions, as is the case for Nakajima quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>Association Rules Machine Learning complete intersection Calabi-Yau 5-Folds and 6-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Association rule machine learning is applied to the dataset of complete intersection Calabi--Yau 5-folds and 6-folds in order to uncover hidden patterns among their Hodge numbers. These Hodge numbers -- six for the 5-folds and nine for the 6-folds -- serve as the items in our analysis. For the 5-folds, we discover 60 significant association rules. For example, within the dataset, if $h_{1,3} = 0$ and $h_{2,2} = 5$, then $h_{1,1} = 3$ with 99.43\% confidence. Similarly, if $h_{2,1} = 0$, $h_{1,3} = 0$, and $h_{2,2} = 5$, then $h_{1,1} = 3$ with 99.42\% confidence. For the 6-folds, we identify 160 association rules across a dataset of 1,482,022 examples. A particularly striking observation is that $h_{1,2} = h_{1,3} = h_{1,4} = h_{2,3} = 0$ for all entries in this dataset. These types of association rules are especially valuable because the Hodge numbers of complete intersection Calabi--Yau 5-folds have only been computed for approximately 53 percent of the dataset, while those of 6-folds remain largely undetermined. The discovered patterns provide predictive insights that can guide future computations and theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>The Real Vanishing Ideals of Nuclear p-Norm Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebraic and geometric structure related to tensor nuclear norms. We show that the unit ball of the nuclear norm is the convex hull of an irreducible real variety and give an explicit description of its real vanishing ideal. As a consequence, we obtain a simple criterion to decide when a primary ideal is prime, and we use it to prove that the ideal of the nuclear 2-norm is real reduced and prime.</description>

      <title>The Degree of Irrationality of del Pezzo Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an irreducible variety $X$ over a field $k$, the degree of irrationality $\operatorname{irr}_k X$ is the minimal degree of a dominant rational map $X \dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}_k^{\operatorname{\dim} X}$. When $X$ is a curve, this is simply the gonality of $X$. We determine the possible degrees of irrationality of del Pezzo surfaces over an assortment of field types: number fields, local fields, finite fields, and arbitrary fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda\colon A\rightarrow A^{\vee}$ be a polarization on an abelian variety over a field $k$. If $k$ is not algebraically closed, there might not exist an ample line bundle on $A$ defined over $k$ that represents $\lambda$. To remedy this, Poonen and Stoll have asked the following question: does there exist a line bundle on an $A$-torsor that represents $\lambda$? We give a criterion for the existence of such a torsor and line bundle which only depends on the kernel of $\lambda$. Using this criterion, we show that the answer to the question is yes when the polarization has odd or small even degree. On the other hand, we show that for every $g\geq 7$, there exists a polarized $g$-dimensional abelian variety for which the answer to the question is no.</description>

Abstract: Universal algebraic geometry is generalised from solutions of equations in a single algebra to the study of $\varphi$- or $K$-spectra, akin to the prime spectrum of a ring. We explore their basic properties and constructions, give a correspondence between certain quantifier-free propositions and closed sets in the Zariski topology of a free algebra, and show the connection with current UAG. Lastly, equationally Noetherian classes and irreducible spectra are explored.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Quantum Geometry of Torus-fibered Calabi-Yau Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About ten years ago, Katz, Klemm and Huang conjectured that topological string amplitudes on compact, elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds at fixed base degree could be expressed in terms of meromorphic Jacobi forms for $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, giving access to Gromov-Witten invariants at arbitrary genus. This was later generalized to torus-fibered CY threefolds with $N$-sections, where topological string amplitudes are conjecturally governed by meromorphic Jacobi forms under the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_1(N)$. In this work, we show that these modularity properties follow from (and are equivalent to) the wave-function property of the topological string partition function $Z_{\rm top}$ under a relative conifold monodromy, implementing a particular Fourier-Mukai transformation on the derived category of coherent sheaves. In particular, we introduce a variant of $Z_{\rm top}$ which is both holomorphic and modular covariant. Under the same relative conifold monodromy, the generating series of genus 0 Gopakumar-Vafa invariants at fixed base degree is mapped to the generating series of rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas indices counting D4-D2-D0-brane bound states wrapped on the torus fiber. We show that the quasimodularity of the generating series of GV invariants matches the expected mock-modular behavior of the generating series of D4-D2-D0 indices, despite having different multi-cover contributions. We analyze and tabulate a large number of CY threefolds fibered over del Pezzo surfaces, with an $N$-section for $N\leq 5$, including several new examples beyond the realm of toric geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decomposable N^d-indexed persistence modules via higher dimensional partitions. Their barcodes are defined in terms of the extended interior of the corresponding Young diagrams. For two decomposable N^d-indexed persistence modules, we present a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of the partitions, for their rank invariants to be the same. This generalizes the well-known fact that for an N-indexed persistence module, its barcode and its rank invariant determine each other, i.e., the rank invariant is a complete invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23932v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conjectures of Braverman and Kazhdan, Ng\^o and Sakellaridis have motivated the development of Schwartz spaces for certain spherical varieties. We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</description>

      <title>Self-covering, finiteness, commutativity, and fibering over tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological space is called self-covering if it is a nontrivial cover of itself. We prove that, under mild assumptions, a closed self-covering manifold with an abelian fundamental group fibers over a torus in various senses. As a corollary, if its dimension is above $5$ and its fundamental group is free abelian, then it is a fiber bundle over a circle. We also construct non-fibering examples when these assumptions are not fulfilled. In particular, one class of examples illustrates that the structure of self-covering manifolds is more complicated when the fundamental groups are nonabelian, and the corresponding fibering problem encounters significant difficulties.</description>

      <title>Sum of Squares Submodularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $t$-sum of squares (sos) submodularity, which is a hierarchy, indexed by $t$, of sufficient algebraic conditions for certifying submodularity of set functions. We show that, for fixed $t$, each level of the hierarchy can be verified via a semidefinite program of size polynomial in $n$, the size of the ground set of the set function. This is particularly relevant given existing hardness results around testing whether a set function is submodular (Crama, 1989). We derive several equivalent algebraic characterizations of $t$-sos submodularity and identify submodularity-preserving operations that also preserve $t$-sos submodularity. We further present a complete classification of the cases for which submodularity and $t$-sos submodularity coincide, as well as examples of $t$-sos-submodular functions. We demonstrate the usefulness of $t$-sos submodularity through three applications: (i) a new convex approach to submodular regression, involving minimal manual tuning; (ii) a systematic procedure to derive lower bounds on the submodularity ratio in approximate submodular maximization, and (iii) improved difference-of-submodular decompositions for difference-of-submodular optimization. Overall, our work builds a new bridge between discrete optimization and real algebraic geometry by connecting sum of squares-based algebraic certificates to a fundamental discrete structure, submodularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply our previous results on ``saturated descent'' to express a wide range of logarithmic cohomology theories in terms of the infinite root stack. Examples include the log cotangent complex, Rognes' log topological cyclic homology, and Nygaard-complete log prismatic cohomology. As applications, we show that the Nygaard-completion of the site-theoretic log prismatic cohomology coincides with the definition arising from log ${\rm TC}$, and we establish a log version of the ${\rm TC}$-variant of the Beilinson fiber square of Antieau--Mathew--Morrow--Nikolaus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Amitsur subgroup of a variety with a group action measures the failure of the action to lift to the total spaces of its line bundles. We introduce the "numerical Amitsur group," which is an approximation of the ordinary Amitsur subgroup that can be computed using only the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic on the Picard group. As an application, we find a uniform upper bound on the exponent of the Amitsur subgroup that depends only on the dimension and arithmetic genus of the variety and is independent of the group. Finally, we compute Amitsur subgroups of toric varieties using these ideas.</description>

      <title>Rank one summands of Frobenius pushforwards of line bundles on G/P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X=G/P$ be a partial flag variety, where $G$ is a semi-simple, simply connected algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field $K$ of positive characteristic. Let $\mathsf{F}\colon X\to X$ be the absolute Frobenius morphism. Given a line bundle $\mathscr{L}$ on $X$ and an integer $r\geq1$, we describe all line bundles that are direct summands of the pushforward $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. For $\mathscr{L}$ corresponding to a dominant weight, we also compute, for $r$ sufficiently large, the multiplicity of $\mathscr{O}_{X}$ as a summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. As an application we answer a question of Gros-Kaneda about the multiplcity of $\mathscr{L}(-\rho)$ as a direct summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}\mathscr{O}_{G/B}$.</description>

      <title>Singularities of symmetric powers and irrationality of motivic zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K_0(\mathcal{V}_{K})$ be the Grothendieck ring of varieties over a field $K$ of characteristic zero, and let $\mathbb{L} = [\mathbb{A}^1_{K}]$ denote the Lefschetz class. We prove that if a $K$-variety has $\mathbb{L}$-rational singularities, then all its symmetric powers also have $\mathbb{L}$-rational singularities. We then use this result to show that, for a smooth complex projective variety $X$ of dimension greater than one, the rationality of its Kapranov motivic zeta function $Z(X, t)$ (viewed as a formal power series over $K_0(\mathcal{V}_{\mathbb{C}})$) implies that the Kodaira dimension of $X$ is negative and that $X$ does not admit global nonzero differential forms of even degree. This extends the irrationality part of the Larsen-Lunts rationality criterion from the surface case to arbitrary dimension. We also discuss some applications of these results.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic cohomology ring of the universal compactified Jacobian over the moduli space of stable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the cohomology rings of universal compactified Jacobians. Over the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ of Deligne-Mumford stable marked curves with $n\geq 1$, on the one hand we show that the cohomology ring of a universal fine compactified Jacobian is sensitive to the choice of a nondegenerate stability condition which answers a question of Pandharipande; on the other hand, we prove that the cohomology ring admits a degeneration via the perverse filtration which is independent of the (nondegenerate) stability condition. The latter defines the intrinsic cohomology ring of the universal compactified Jacobian which only relies on $g,n$.
  Our main tools include the support theorems, the recently developed Fourier theory for dualizable abelian fibrations, and the universal double ramification cycle relations associated with the universal Picard stack.</description>

Abstract: We study jet schemes of Newton non-degenerate plane curve singularities. We identify a subgraph of the graph of jet components and show that it can be constructed from walks on the lattice points in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane. In particular, we determine all the irreducible components of the jet schemes. Furthermore, we prove that this subgraph encodes the embedded topological type of the curve singularity in the plane. Finally, we introduce a generating series defined in terms of the irreducible components of the jet schemes and their (co-)dimensions, and we prove that this series is rational and explicitly determine its poles.</description>

      <title>Solvable and Nilpotent Matroids: Realizability and Irreducible Decomposition of Their Associated Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the families of solvable and nilpotent matroids, examining their realization spaces, closures, and associated matroid and circuit varieties. We study their realizability, as well as the irreducible decomposition of their associated matroid and circuit varieties. Additionally, we describe a finite generating set for the corresponding ideals, considered up to radical. We establish sufficient conditions for both the realizability of these matroids and the irreducibility of their associated varieties. Specifically, we establish the realizability and irreducibility of matroid varieties associated with nilpotent matroids and prove the irreducibility of matroid varieties arising from certain classes of solvable paving matroids. Additionally, we analyze the defining polynomial equations of these varieties using Grassmann-Cayley algebra and geometric liftability techniques. Furthermore, we provide a complete generating set for the matroid ideals associated with forest configurations.</description>

      <title>Universal Koszul Duality for Kac-Moody Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a monoidal equivalence, called universal Koszul duality, between genuine equivariant K-motives on a Kac-Moody flag variety and constructible monodromic sheaves on its Langlands dual. The equivalence is obtained by a Soergel-theoretic description of both sides which extends results for finite-dimensional flag varieties by Taylor and the first author.
  Universal Koszul duality bundles together a whole family of equivalences for each point of a maximal torus. At the identity, it recovers an ungraded version of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel's and Bezrukavnikov-Yun's Koszul duality for equivariant and unipotently monodromic sheaves. It also generalizes Soergel-theoretic descriptions for monodromic categories on finite-dimensional flag varieties by Lusztig-Yun, Gouttard and the second author. For affine Kac-Moody groups, our work sheds new light on the conjectured quantum Satake equivalences by Cautis-Kamnitzer and Gaitsgory.
  On our way, we establish foundations on six functors for reduced K-motives and introduce a formalism of constructible monodromic sheaves.</description>
