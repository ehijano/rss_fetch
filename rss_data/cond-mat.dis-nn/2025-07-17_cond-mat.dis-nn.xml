      <title>Geometric Theory of Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute to the mathematical theory of the design of low temperature Ising machines, a type of experimental probabilistic computing device implementing the Ising model. Encoding the output of a function in the ground state of a physical system allows efficient and distributed computation, but the design of the energy function is a difficult puzzle. We introduce a diagrammatic device that allows us to visualize the decision boundaries for Ising circuits. It is then used to prove two results: (1) Ising circuits are a generalization of 1-NN classifiers with a certain special structure, and (2) Elimination of local minima in the energy landscape can be formulated as a linear programming problem.</description>

      <title>Banding and polarization in driven multistable materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a disordered network of bistable bonds subjected to periodic strain. The model is inspired by experiments on crumpled sheets and it features behaviors associated with glasses, including a complex energy landscape, memories, and large avalanches. At small strain amplitudes, the system quickly converges to a limit cycle where the system repeatedly cycles between a set of states. At large amplitudes, motion is erratic and does not converge to a limit cycle. The transition appears to be continuous, with diverging time scales. The nature of instabilities is different on both sides of the transition. At small strain amplitudes, instabilities are correlated only over a finite distance. Above the transition, instabilities are localized along diagonal bands. The distance between bands grows near the transition and appears to diverge. We propose a simple model that explains these observations. Below the transition, we propose a new ``order parameter'' -- the polarization of the instabilities along the driving direction.</description>

      <title>Topology-Enhanced Superconducting Qubit Networks for In-Sensor Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</description>

      <title>Expansion creates spin-glass order in finite-connectivity models: a rigorous and intuitive approach from the theory of LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex free-energy landscapes with many local minima separated by large barriers are believed to underlie glassy behavior across diverse physical systems. This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry breaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for certain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a rigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models with local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs. To this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the mathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees extensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional assumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the low-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an asymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the landscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of the total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states -- which we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and treats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those with short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our results apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p, and while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family of codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random regular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both models undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to the onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover the emergence of multiple topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) in a 1D spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain driven by Fibonacci modulation, transforming a trivial band structure into a cascade of topologically nontrivial phases. This intriguing phenomenon is marked by the appearance of zero-energy modes and transitions in the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological quantum number. Strikingly, as the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases grows, a behavior intricately linked to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. Unlike conventional TAI phases, which exhibit fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases exhibit multifractal behavior. Furthermore, this model can be experimentally realized in a Bose-Einstein condensate along the momentum lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal properties can be probed through quench dynamics. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic disorder-induced topological phases and their intricate multifractal nature.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
