      <title>Reviving Thorup's Shortcut Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24954v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to revive Thorup's conjecture [Thorup, WG'92] on the existence of reachability shortcuts with ideal size-diameter tradeoffs. Thorup originally asked whether, given any graph $G=(V,E)$ with $m$ edges, we can add $m^{1+o(1)}$ ``shortcut'' edges $E_+$ from the transitive closure $E^*$ of $G$ so that $\text{dist}_{G_+}(u,v) \leq m^{o(1)}$ for all $(u,v)\in E^*$, where $G_+=(V,E\cup E_+)$. The conjecture was refuted by Hesse [Hesse, SODA'03], followed by significant efforts in the last few years to optimize the lower bounds.
  In this paper we observe that although Hesse refuted the letter of Thorup's conjecture, his work~[Hesse, SODA'03] -- and all followup work -- does not refute the spirit of the conjecture, which should allow $G_+$ to contain both new (shortcut) edges and new Steiner vertices. Our results are as follows.
  (1) On the positive side, we present explicit attacks that break all known shortcut lower bounds when Steiner vertices are allowed.
  (2) On the negative side, we rule out ideal $m^{1+o(1)}$-size, $m^{o(1)}$-diameter shortcuts whose ``thickness'' is $t=o(\log n/\log \log n)$, meaning no path can contain $t$ consecutive Steiner vertices.
  (3) We propose a candidate hard instance as the next step toward resolving the revised version of Thorup's conjecture.
  Finally, we show promising implications. Almost-optimal parallel algorithms for computing a generalization of the shortcut that approximately preserves distances or flows imply almost-optimal parallel algorithms with $m^{o(1)}$ depth for exact shortcut paths and exact maximum flow. The state-of-the-art algorithms have much worse depth of $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ [Rozho\v{n}, Haeupler, Martinsson, STOC'23] and $m^{1+o(1)}$ [Chen, Kyng, Liu, FOCS'22], respectively.</description>

      <title>Hedgegraph Polymatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs and hypergraphs combine expressive modeling power with algorithmic efficiency for a wide range of applications. Hedgegraphs generalize hypergraphs further by grouping hyperedges under a color/hedge. This allows hedgegraphs to model dependencies between hyperedges and leads to several applications. However, it poses algorithmic challenges. In particular, the cut function is not submodular, which has been a barrier to algorithms for connectivity. In this work, we introduce two alternative partition-based measures of connectivity in hedgegraphs and study their structural and algorithmic aspects. Instead of the cut function, we investigate a polymatroid associated with hedgegraphs. The polymatroidal lens leads to new tractability results as well as insightful generalizations of classical results on graphs and hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>$\{s,t\}$-Separating Principal Partition Sequence of Submodular Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narayanan and Fujishige showed the existence of the principal partition sequence of a submodular function, a structure with numerous applications in areas such as clustering, fast algorithms, and approximation algorithms. In this work, motivated by two applications, we develop a theory of $\{s,t\}$-separating principal partition sequence of a submodular function. We define this sequence, show its existence, and design a polynomial-time algorithm to construct it. We show two applications: (1) approximation algorithm for the $\{s,t\}$-separating submodular $k$-partitioning problem for monotone and posimodular functions and (2) polynomial-time algorithm for the hypergraph orientation problem of finding an orientation that simultaneously has strong connectivity at least $k$ and $(s,t)$-connectivity at least $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Can Like Attract Like? A Study of Homonymous Gathering in Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A team of mobile agents, starting from distinct nodes of a network, have to meet at the same node and declare that they all met. Agents execute the same algorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent entering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the network in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly local. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed mobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity, i.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent and the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions typically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known only to themselves. But must all labels be pairwise distinct to guarantee deterministic gathering?
  We address this question by considering agents that may share the same label. A team L is said to be gatherable if, for every initial setting of L, there is an algorithm that solves gathering. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give a full characterization of the gatherable teams. (2) We design an algorithm that gathers all of them in poly$(n,\log\lambda)$ time, where $n$ (resp. $\lambda$) is the graph order (resp. the smallest label in L). This algorithm requires the agents to initially share only $O(\log \log \log \mu)$ bits of common knowledge, where $\mu$ is the largest label multiplicity in L. (3) We show this dependency is almost optimal to get a poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time complexity.
  As a by-product, we get the first deterministic poly$(n,\log\lambda)$-time algorithm requiring no common knowledge to gather any team when all labels are distinct. Known to be achievable for two-agent teams, extending this to any team size faced a major challenge: termination detection. Our techniques to address it may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Fast Dimensionality Reduction from $\ell_2$ to $\ell_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma is a fundamental result in dimensionality reduction, ensuring that any finite set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ can be embedded into a lower-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^k$ while approximately preserving all pairwise Euclidean distances. In recent years, embeddings that preserve Euclidean distances when measured via the $\ell_1$ norm in the target space have received increasing attention due to their relevance in applications such as nearest neighbor search in high dimensions. A recent breakthrough by Dirksen, Mendelson, and Stollenwerk established an optimal $\ell_2 \to \ell_1$ embedding with computational complexity $O(d \log d)$. In this work, we generalize this direction and propose a simple linear embedding from $\ell_2$ to $\ell_p$ for any $p \in [1,2]$ based on a construction of Ailon and Liberty. Our method achieves a reduced runtime of $O(d \log k)$ when $k \leq d^{1/4}$, improving upon prior runtime results when the target dimension is small. Additionally, we show that for \emph{any norm} $\|\cdot\|$ in the target space, any embedding of $(\mathbb{R}^d, \|\cdot\|_2)$ into $(\mathbb{R}^k, \|\cdot\|)$ with distortion $\varepsilon$ generally requires $k = \Omega\big(\varepsilon^{-2} \log(\varepsilon^2 n)/\log(1/\varepsilon)\big)$, matching the optimal bound for the $\ell_2$ case up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Inverse Approximations under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However, real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling, sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\) approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation. Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap, spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the \emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in noisy computational environments.</description>

      <title>Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast, captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$, where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals, including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under diverse perturbation regimes.</description>

      <title>Exact zCDP Characterizations for Fundamental Differentially Private Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP) is a variant of differential privacy (DP) that is widely used partly thanks to its nice composition property. While a tight conversion from $\epsilon$-DP to zCDP exists for the worst-case mechanism, many common algorithms satisfy stronger guarantees. In this work, we derive tight zCDP characterizations for several fundamental mechanisms. We prove that the tight zCDP bound for the $\epsilon$-DP Laplace mechanism is exactly $\epsilon + e^{-\epsilon} - 1$, confirming a recent conjecture by Wang (2022). We further provide tight bounds for the discrete Laplace mechanism, $k$-Randomized Response (for $k \leq 6$), and RAPPOR. Lastly, we also provide a tight zCDP bound for the worst case bounded range mechanism.</description>

      <title>Range (R\'enyi) Entropy Queries and Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15959v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data partitioning that maximizes/minimizes the Shannon entropy, or more generally the R\'enyi entropy is a crucial subroutine in data compression, columnar storage, and cardinality estimation algorithms. These partition algorithms can be accelerated if we have a data structure to compute the entropy in different subsets of data when the algorithm needs to decide what block to construct. Such a data structure will also be useful for data analysts exploring different subsets of data to identify areas of interest. While it is generally known how to compute the Shannon or the R\'enyi entropy of a discrete distribution in the offline or streaming setting efficiently, we focus on the query setting where we aim to efficiently derive the entropy among a subset of data that satisfy some linear predicates. We solve this problem in a typical setting when we deal with real data, where data items are geometric points and each requested area is a query (hyper)rectangle. More specifically, we consider a set $P$ of $n$ weighted and colored points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is a constant. For the range S-entropy (resp. R-entropy) query problem, the goal is to construct a low space data structure, such that given a query (hyper)rectangle $R$, it computes the Shannon (resp. R\'enyi) entropy based on the colors and the weights of the points in $P\cap R$, in sublinear time. We show conditional lower bounds proving that we cannot hope for data structures with near-linear space and near-constant query time for both the range S-entropy and R-entropy query problems. Then, we propose exact data structures for $d=1$ and $d&gt;1$ with $o(n^{2d})$ space and $o(n)$ query time for both problems. Finally, we propose near linear space data structures for returning either an additive or a multiplicative approximation of the Shannon (resp. R\'enyi) entropy in $P\cap R$.</description>

Abstract: Clustering problems such as $k$-means and $k$-median are staples of unsupervised learning, and many algorithmic techniques have been developed to tackle their numerous aspects.
  In this paper, we focus on the class of greedy approximation algorithm, that attracted less attention than local-search or primal-dual counterparts. In particular, we study the recursive greedy algorithm developed by Mettu and Plaxton [SIAM J. Comp 2003]. We provide a simplification of the algorithm, allowing for faster implementation, in graph metrics or in Euclidean space, where our algorithm matches or improves the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Dynamic r-index: An Updatable Self-Index in LCP-bounded Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-index is a compressed data structure that supports locate queries -- reporting all positions where a given pattern occurs in a string while maintaining the string in compressed form. While many self-indexes have been proposed, developing dynamically updatable ones supporting string insertions and deletions remains a challenge. The r-index (Gagie et al., JACM'20) is a representative static self-index based on the run-length Burrows-Wheeler transform (RLBWT), designed for highly repetitive strings. We present the dynamic r-index, a dynamic extension of the r-index that achieves updates in LCP-bounded time. The dynamic r-index supports count queries in $O(m \log r / \log \log r)$ time and locate queries in $O(m \log r / \log \log r + \mathsf{occ} \log r)$ time, using $O(r)$ words of space, where $m$ is the length of a query with $\mathsf{occ}$ occurrences and $r$ is the number of runs in the RLBWT. Crucially, update operations are supported in $O((m + L_{\mathsf{max}}) \log n)$ time for a substring of length $m$, where $L_{\mathsf{max}}$ is the maximum LCP value; the average running time is $O((m + L_{\mathsf{avg}}) \log n)$, where $L_{\mathsf{avg}}$ is the average LCP value. This LCP-bounded complexity is particularly advantageous for highly repetitive strings where LCP values are typically small. We experimentally demonstrate the practical efficiency of the dynamic r-index on various highly repetitive datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Online Bipartite Fractional Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online bipartite matching is a fundamental problem in online optimization, extensively studied both in its integral and fractional forms due to its theoretical significance and practical applications, such as online advertising and resource allocation. Motivated by recent progress in learning-augmented algorithms, we study online bipartite fractional matching when the algorithm is given advice in the form of a suggested matching in each iteration. We develop algorithms for both the vertex-weighted and unweighted variants that provably dominate the naive "coin flip" strategy of randomly choosing between the advice-following and advice-free algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm for the vertex-weighted setting extends to the AdWords problem under the small bids assumption, yielding a significant improvement over the seminal work of Mahdian, Nazerzadeh, and Saberi (EC 2007, TALG 2012). Complementing our positive results, we establish a hardness bound on the robustness-consistency tradeoff that is attainable by any algorithm. We empirically validate our algorithms through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Amnesiac Flooding: Easy to break, hard to escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadcast is a central problem in distributed computing. Recently, Hussak and Trehan [PODC'19/DC'23] proposed a stateless broadcasting protocol (Amnesiac Flooding), which was surprisingly proven to terminate in asymptotically optimal time (linear in the diameter of the network). However, it remains unclear: (i) Are there other stateless terminating broadcast algorithms with the desirable properties of Amnesiac Flooding, (ii) How robust is Amnesiac Flooding with respect to \emph{faults}?
  In this paper we make progress on both of these fronts. Under a reasonable restriction (obliviousness to message content) additional to the fault-free synchronous model, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding is the \emph{only} strictly stateless deterministic protocol that can achieve terminating broadcast. We achieve this by identifying four natural properties of a terminating broadcast protocol that Amnesiac Flooding uniquely satisfies. In contrast, we prove that even minor relaxations of \textit{any} of these four criteria allow the construction of other terminating broadcast protocols.
  On the other hand, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding can become non-terminating or non-broadcasting, even if we allow just one node to drop a single message on a single edge in a single round. As a tool for proving this, we focus on the set of all \textit{configurations} of transmissions between nodes in the network, and obtain a \textit{dichotomy} characterizing the configurations, starting from which, Amnesiac Flooding terminates.
  Additionally, we characterise the structure of sets of Byzantine agents capable of forcing non-termination or non-broadcast of the protocol on arbitrary networks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Kernel Function for Fast Angle Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the angle testing problem in the context of similarity search in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel functions. We apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the widely-used graph-based search algorithm HNSW.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Frontier Exploration on Graphs with Applications to Network-Based Disease Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem on a $n$-node graph $\mathcal{G}$ where each node has an unknown label from a finite set $\mathbf{\Omega}$, drawn from a joint distribution $\mathcal{P}$ that is Markov with respect to $\mathcal{G}$. At each step, selecting a node reveals its label and yields a label-dependent reward. The goal is to adaptively choose nodes to maximize expected accumulated discounted rewards. We impose a frontier exploration constraint, where actions are limited to neighbors of previously selected nodes, reflecting practical constraints in settings such as contact tracing and robotic exploration. We design a Gittins index-based policy that applies to general graphs and is provably optimal when $\mathcal{G}$ is a forest. Our implementation runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|^2)$ time while using $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|^2)$ oracle calls to $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot |\mathbf{\Omega}|)$ space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our method consistently outperforms natural baselines, including in non-tree, budget-limited, and undiscounted settings. For example, in HIV testing simulations on real-world sexual interaction networks, our policy detects nearly all positive cases with only half the population tested, substantially outperforming other baselines.</description>
