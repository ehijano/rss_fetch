      <title>How Much Weak Overlap Can Doubly Robust T-Statistics Handle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of sufficiently weak overlap, it is known that no regular root-n-consistent estimators exist and standard estimators may fail to be asymptotically normal. This paper shows that a thresholded version of the standard doubly robust estimator is asymptotically normal with well-calibrated Wald confidence intervals even when constructed using nonparametric estimates of the propensity score and conditional mean outcome. The analysis implies a cost of weak overlap in terms of black-box nuisance rates, borne when the semiparametric bound is infinite, and the contribution of outcome smoothness to the outcome regression rate, which is incurred even when the semiparametric bound is finite. As a byproduct of this analysis, I show that under weak overlap, the optimal global regression rate is the same as the optimal pointwise regression rate, without the usual polylogarithmic penalty. The high-level conditions yield new rules of thumb for thresholding in practice. In simulations, thresholded AIPW can exhibit moderate overrejection in small samples, but I am unable to reject a null hypothesis of exact coverage in large samples. In an empirical application, the clipped AIPW estimator that targets the standard average treatment effect yields similar precision to a heuristic 10% fixed-trimming approach that changes the target sample.</description>

      <title>Foundations of locally-balanced Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formally introduce and study locally-balanced Markov jump processes (LBMJPs) defined on a general state space. These continuous-time stochastic processes with a user-specified limiting distribution are designed for sampling in settings involving discrete parameters and/or non-smooth distributions, addressing limitations of other processes such as the overdamped Langevin diffusion. The paper establishes the well-posedness, non-explosivity, and ergodicity of LBMJPs under mild conditions. We further explore regularity properties such as the Feller property and characterise the weak generator of the process. We then derive conditions for exponential ergodicity via spectral gaps and establish comparison theorems for different balancing functions. In particular we show an equivalence between the spectral gaps of Metropolis--Hastings algorithms and LBMJPs with bounded balancing function, but show that LBMJPs can exhibit uniform ergodicity on unbounded state spaces when the balancing function is unbounded, even when the limiting distribution is not sub-Gaussian. We also establish a diffusion limit for an LBMJP in the small jump limit, and discuss applications to Monte Carlo sampling and non-reversible extensions of the processes.</description>

      <title>Mixed Fractional Information: Consistency of Dissipation Measures for Stable Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric alpha-stable (S alpha S) distributions with alpha&lt;2 lack finite classical Fisher information. Building on Johnson's framework, we define Mixed Fractional Information (MFI) via the initial rate of relative entropy dissipation during interpolation between S alpha S laws with differing scales, v and s. We demonstrate two equivalent formulations for MFI in this specific S alpha S-to-S alpha S setting. The first involves the derivative D'(v) of the relative entropy between the two S alpha S densities. The second uses an integral expectation E_gv[u(x,0) (pF_v(x) - pF_s(x))] involving the difference between Fisher scores (pF_v, pF_s) and a specific MMSE-related score function u(x,0) derived from the interpolation dynamics. Our central contribution is a rigorous proof of the consistency identity: D'(v) = (1/(alpha v)) E_gv[X (pF_v(X) - pF_s(X))]. This identity mathematically validates the equivalence of the two MFI formulations for S alpha S inputs, establishing MFI's internal coherence and directly linking entropy dissipation rates to score function differences. We further establish MFI's non-negativity (zero if and only if v=s), derive its closed-form expression for the Cauchy case (alpha=1), and numerically validate the consistency identity. MFI provides a finite, coherent, and computable information-theoretic measure for comparing S alpha S distributions where classical Fisher information fails, connecting entropy dynamics to score functions and estimation concepts. This work lays a foundation for exploring potential fractional I-MMSE relations and new functional inequalities tailored to heavy-tailed systems.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time filtering in Lie groups: estimation via the Fr{\'e}chet mean of solutions to stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Fr\'echet mean $\mathscr{E}_t$ of the solution $X_{t}$ to a continuous-time stochastic differential equation in a Lie group. It provides an estimator with minimal variance of $X_{t}$. We use it in the context of Kalman filtering and more precisely to infer rotation matrices. In this paper, we focus on the prediction step between two consecutive observations. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our assumptions on the model are minimal.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Averaging in Causal Instrumental Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variables are a popular tool to infer causal effects under unobserved confounding, but choosing suitable instruments is challenging in practice. We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that addresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental variables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends previous work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates non-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than existing methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to update models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this model selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model uncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and provides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments, gIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate its usefulness in two empirical applications: the effects of malaria and institutions on income per capita and the returns to schooling. A software implementation of gIVBMA is available in Julia.</description>

      <title>Set-valued conditional functionals of random sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many key quantities in statistics and probability theory such as the expectation, quantiles, expectiles and many risk measures are law-determined maps from a space of random variables to the reals. We call such a law-determined map, which is normalised, positively homogeneous, monotone and translation equivariant, a gauge function. Considered as a functional on the space of distributions, we can apply such a gauge to the conditional distribution of a random variable. This results in conditional gauges, such as conditional quantiles or conditional expectations. In this paper, we apply such scalar gauges to the support function of a random closed convex set $\bX$. This leads to a set-valued extension of a gauge function. We also introduce a conditional variant whose values are themselves random closed convex sets. In special cases, this functional becomes the conditional set-valued quantile or the conditional set-valued expectation of a random set. In particular, in the unconditional setup, if $\bX$ is a random translation of a deterministic cone and the gauge is either a quantile or an expectile, we recover the cone distribution functions studied by Andreas Hamel and his co-authors. In the conditional setup, the conditional quantile of a random singleton yields the conditional version of the half-space depth-trimmed regions.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Elementwise-Transformed Spiked Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns elementwise-transformations of spiked matrices: $Y_n = n^{-1/2} f( \sqrt{n} X_n + Z_n)$. Here, $f$ is a function applied elementwise, $X_n$ is a low-rank signal matrix, and $Z_n$ is white noise. We find that principal component analysis is powerful for recovering signal under highly nonlinear or discontinuous transformations. Specifically, in the high-dimensional setting where $Y_n$ is of size $n \times p$ with $n,p \rightarrow \infty$ and $p/n \rightarrow \gamma &gt; 0$, we uncover a phase transition: for signal-to-noise ratios above a sharp threshold -- depending on $f$, the distribution of elements of $Z_n$, and the limiting aspect ratio $\gamma$ -- the principal components of $Y_n$ (partially) recover those of $X_n$. Below this threshold, the principal components of $Y_n$ are asymptotically orthogonal to the signal. In contrast, in the standard setting where $X_n + n^{-1/2}Z_n$ is observed directly, the analogous phase transition depends only on $\gamma$. A similar phenomenon occurs with $X_n$ square and symmetric and $Z_n$ a generalized Wigner matrix.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for mean-field variational inference via polyhedral optimization in the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of finite-dimensional polyhedral subsets over the Wasserstein space and optimization of functionals over them via first-order methods. Our main application is to the problem of mean-field variational inference, which seeks to approximate a distribution $\pi$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a product measure $\pi^\star$. When $\pi$ is strongly log-concave and log-smooth, we provide (1) approximation rates certifying that $\pi^\star$ is close to the minimizer $\pi^\star_\diamond$ of the KL divergence over a \emph{polyhedral} set $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$, and (2) an algorithm for minimizing $\text{KL}(\cdot\|\pi)$ over $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$ based on accelerated gradient descent over $\R^d$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain the first end-to-end analysis for gradient-based algorithms for MFVI.</description>

      <title>Confidence on the Focal: Conformal Prediction with Selection-Conditional Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction builds marginally valid prediction intervals that cover the unknown outcome of a randomly drawn test point with a prescribed probability. However, in practice, data-driven methods are often used to identify specific test unit(s) of interest, requiring uncertainty quantification tailored to these focal units. In such cases, marginally valid conformal prediction intervals may fail to provide valid coverage for the focal unit(s) due to selection bias. This paper presents a general framework for constructing a prediction set with finite-sample exact coverage, conditional on the unit being selected by a given procedure. The general form of our method accommodates arbitrary selection rules that are invariant to the permutation of the calibration units, and generalizes Mondrian Conformal Prediction to multiple test units and non-equivariant classifiers. We also work out computationally efficient implementation of our framework for a number of realistic selection rules, including top-K selection, optimization-based selection, selection based on conformal p-values, and selection based on properties of preliminary conformal prediction sets. The performance of our methods is demonstrated via applications in drug discovery and health risk prediction.</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Inference on Causal Derivative Effects for Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical methods for causal inference with continuous treatments mainly focus on estimating the mean potential outcome function, commonly known as the dose-response curve. However, it is often not the dose-response curve but its derivative function that signals the treatment effect. In this paper, we investigate nonparametric inference on the derivative of the dose-response curve with and without the positivity condition. Under the positivity and other regularity conditions, we propose a doubly robust (DR) inference method for estimating the derivative of the dose-response curve using kernel smoothing. When the positivity condition is violated, we demonstrate the inconsistency of conventional inverse probability weighting (IPW) and DR estimators, and introduce novel bias-corrected IPW and DR estimators. In all settings, our DR estimator achieves asymptotic normality at the standard nonparametric rate of convergence with nonparametric efficiency guarantees. Additionally, our approach reveals an interesting connection to nonparametric support and level set estimation problems. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our proposed estimators through simulations and a case study of evaluating a job training program.</description>
