      <title>A product of strongly quasi-nonexpansive mappings in Hadamard spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the product of strongly quasi-nonexpansive $\Delta$-demiclosed mappings is also a strongly quasi-nonexpansive orbital $\Delta$-demiclosed mapping in Hadamard spaces. Additionally, we establish the $\Delta$-convergence theorem for approximating a common fixed point of infinite products of these mappings in Hadamard spaces. Our results have practical applications in convex function minimization, the minimization of the sum of finitely many convex functions, and solving the convex feasibility problem for finitely many sets in Hadamard spaces.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Grand Lorentz Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, new anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces are defined and their properties are studied. These spaces are a new structure that provides a unified parameter for the study of various functional spaces. The consideration of grand spaces is especially important for the study of boundary conditions of parameters and allows us to achieve new results in this area. The study of boundary parameters in classical spaces is not always possible. In recent years, grand Lebesgue spaces and their generalizations have been widely studied in problems of functional spaces. These spaces are generalizations of classical Lorentz and grand Lorentz spaces. The article defines grand anisotropic Lorentz spaces, gives basic estimates in these spaces, proves embedding theorems, and derives embedding theorems for parameters. The results obtained can play an important role not only in theoretical, but also in applied problems.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal BV and nonlocal Sobolev spaces induced by nonfractional weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand upon the theory of the space of functions with nonlocal weighted bounded variation, first introduced by Kindermann et.al. in 2005 and later generalized by Wang et.al. in 2014. We consider nonfractional C^1 weights and, using an analogous formulation to the aforementioned works, we also introduce a (to our knowledge) new class of nonlocal weighted Sobolev spaces. After establishing some fundamental properties and results regarding the structure of these spaces, we study their relationship with the classical BV and Sobolev spaces, as well as with the space of test functions. We handle both the case of domains with finite measure and that of domains of infinite measure, and show that these two situations lead to quite different scenarios. As an application, we also show that these function spaces are suitable for establishing existence and uniqueness results of global minimizers for several classes of functionals. Some of these functionals were introduced in the above-mentioned references for the study of image deblurring problems.</description>

      <title>The Quantitative Faber-Krahn Inequality for the Combinatorial Laplacian in $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the classical Faber-Krahn inequality shows that the ball uniquely minimizes the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian in the continuum, this rigidity may fail in the discrete setting. We establish quantitative fluctuation estimates for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the combinatorial Laplacian on subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ when their cardinality diverges. Our approach is based on a controlled discrete-to-continuum extension of the associated variational problem and the quantitative Faber-Krahn inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an infinite system of ordinary differential equations that models the evolution of coagulating and fragmenting clusters, which we assume to be composed of identical units. Under very mild assumptions on the coefficients we prove existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions of a corresponding semi-linear Cauchy problem in a weighted $\ell^1$ space. This requires the application of novel results, which we prove for abstract semi-linear Cauchy problems in Banach lattices where the non-linear term is defined only on a dense subspace.</description>

      <title>Square Root Operators and the Well-Posedness of Pseudodifferential Parabolic Models of Wave Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudodifferential parabolic equations with an operator square root arise in wave propagation problems as a one-way counterpart of the Helmholtz equation. The expression under the square root usually involves a differential operator and a known function. We discuss a rigorous definition of such operator square roots and show well-posedness of the pseudodifferential parabolic equation by using the theory of strongly continuous semigroups. This provides a justification for a family of widely-used numerical methods for wavefield simulations in various areas of physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple, connected, and noncompact Lie group with a finite center. We consider the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ on the homogeneous space $G/K=S$ by a maximal compact subgroup $K$. We obtain pointwise estimates for the kernel of an oscillating function $\exp( it\sqrt{|x|}) \psi(x) $ applied to the shifted Laplacian $\Delta+|\rho|^2$, a case not available before. We obtain a polynomial decay in time of the kernel, and of the $L^{p'}-L^p$ norms of the operator, for $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>A simple range characterization for spherical mean transform in even dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a new and simple range characterization for the spherical mean transform of functions supported in the unit ball in even dimensions. It complements the previous work of the same authors, where they solved an analogous problem in odd dimensions. The range description in even dimensions consists of symmetry relations, using a special kind of elliptic integrals involving the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansion of the function in the range of the transform. The article also introduces a pair of original identities involving normalized Bessel functions of the first and the second kind. The first result is an integral cross-product identity for Bessel functions of integer order, complementing a similar relation for Bessel functions of half-integer order obtained in the aforementioned work of the same authors. The second result is a new Nicholson-type identity. Both of these relations can be considered as important standalone results in the theory of special functions. Finally, as part of the proof of one of the theorems, the authors derive an interesting equality involving elliptic integrals, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>From completeness of discrete translates to phaseless sampling of the short-time Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness problem in short-time Fourier transform phase retrieval by exploring a connection to the completeness problem of discrete translates. Specifically, we prove that functions in $L^2(K)$ with $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ compact, are uniquely determined by phaseless lattice-samples of its short-time Fourier transform with window function $g$, provided that specific density properties of translates of $g$ are met. By proving completeness statements for systems of discrete translates in Banach function spaces on compact sets, we obtain new uniqueness statements for phaseless sampling on lattices beyond the known Gaussian window regime. Our results apply to a large class of window functions, which are relevant in time-frequency analysis and applications.</description>

      <title>A dilation theoretic approach to Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a complex Banach space $\mathbb X$, we prove that $\mathbb X$ is a Hilbert space if and only if every strict contraction $T$ on $\mathbb X$ dilates to an isometry if and only if for every strict contraction $T$ on $\mathbb X$ the function $A_T: \mathbb X \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ defined by $A_T(x)=(\|x\|^2 -\|Tx\|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ gives a norm on $\mathbb X$. We also find several other necessary and sufficient conditions in this thread such that a Banach sapce becomes a Hilbert space. We construct examples of strict contractions on non-Hilbert Banach spaces that do not dilate to isometries. Then we characterize all strict contractions on a non-Hilbert Banach space that dilate to isometries and find explicit isometric dilation for them. We prove several other results including characterizations of complemented subspaces in a Banach space, extension of a Wold isometry to a Banach space unitary and describing norm attainment sets of Banach space operators in terms of dilations.</description>

      <title>Fourier and Helgason Fourier transforms for Vector Bundle-valued Differential Forms on Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the perspective of the functional equation satisfied by the classical Fourier transform to derive the Helgason Fourier transform map $\Omega^{l}(G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,V[\chi]):f\longmapsto \widehat{f}:G/K\times G/P\mapsto V[\chi]:(x,b)\longmapsto\widehat{f}(x,b)$ (for $W-$valued differential forms $f\in \Omega^{l}(G/K,W)$) as the $G-$ invariant vector bundle-valued differential form $\widehat{f}$ on the product space $G/K\times G/P$ whose image under the vector bundle-valued Poisson transform is the fibre convolution-integral $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}* f$ on $G/K,$ where $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}$ is the $W-$valued $\tau-$spherical $l-$form on $G/K.$ Explicitly, we prove that $$\widehat{f}_{l,k,\varepsilon(\lambda)}(x,b)=({\bf C_{o}\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}(\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\lambda,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x),$$ where $b\in G/P$ is a consequence of the boundary map $\beta^{V}(\lambda),$ ${\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}$ is the vector bundle-valued Harish-Chandra $c-$function and for some $\lambda-$linear relation, $\varepsilon(\lambda).$ The Fourier transform is found to be the map $\Omega^{l}G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,W)$ $:f\mapsto f^{\triangle}:$ $G/P\times G/K\longrightarrow W$ $:(b,x)\longmapsto f^{\triangle}(b,x)$ and is then established to be explicitly given as $f^{\triangle}_{l,k,\upsilon(\lambda)}(b,x)=$ $$\int_{G/P}\phi_{k,l,\lambda}\wedge\pi^{*}_{P}(({\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\lambda,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x)),$$ where $\upsilon(\lambda)$ is some $\lambda-$linear relation.</description>

      <title>Normed modules and the categorification of integrations, series expansions, and differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the assignment of norms to $\mathit{\Lambda}$-modules over a finite-dimensional algebra $\mathit{\Lambda}$, resulting in the establishment of normed $\mathit{\Lambda}$-modules. Our primary contribution lies in constructing two new categories $\mathscr{N}\!\!or^p$ and $\mathscr{A}^p$, where each object in $\mathscr{N}\!\!or^p$ is a normed $\mathit{\Lambda}$-module $N$ limited by a special element $v_N\in N$ and a special $\mathit{\Lambda}$-homomorphism $\delta_N: N^{\oplus 2^{\dim\mathit{\Lambda}}} \to N$, the morphism in $\mathscr{N}\!\!or^p$ is a $\mathit{\Lambda}$-homomorphism $\theta: N\to M$ such that $\theta(v_N) = v_M$ and $\theta\delta_N = \delta_M\theta^{\oplus 2^{\dim\mathit{\Lambda}}}$, and $\mathscr{A}^p$ is a full subcategory of $\mathscr{N}\!\!or^p$ generated by all Banach modules. By examining the objects and morphisms in these categories. We establish a framework for understanding the categorification of integration, series expansions, and derivatives. Furthermore, we obtain the Stone--Weierstrass approximation theorem in the sense of $\mathscr{A}^p$.</description>

Abstract: Regarding the representation theorem of Kolmogorov and Arnold (KA) as an algorithm for representing or {\guillemotleft}expressing{\guillemotright} functions, we test its robustness by analyzing its ability to withstand adversarial attacks. We find KA to be robust to countable collections of continuous adversaries, but unearth a question about the equi-continuity of the outer functions that, so far, obstructs taking limits and defeating continuous groups of adversaries. This question on the regularity of the outer functions is relevant to the debate over the applicability of KA to the general theory of NNs.</description>
