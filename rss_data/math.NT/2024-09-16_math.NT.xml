      <title>Lower order terms in the shape of cubic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate equidistribution of the lattice shape of cubic fields when ordered by discriminant, giving an estimate in the Eisenstein series spectrum with a lower order main term. The analysis gives a separate discussion of the contributions of reducible and irreducible binary cubic forms, following a method of Shintani. Our work answers a question posed at the American Institute of Math by giving a precise geometric and spectral description of an evident barrier to equidistribution in the lattice shape.</description>

      <title>On the number of irreducible factors with a given multiplicity in function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k \geq 1$ be a natural number and $f \in \mathbb{F}_q[t]$ be a monic polynomial. Let $\omega_k(f)$ denote the number of distinct monic irreducible factors of $f$ with multiplicity $k$. We obtain asymptotic estimates for the first and the second moments of $\omega_k(f)$ with $k \geq 1$. Moreover, we prove that the function $\omega_1(f)$ has normal order $\log (\text{deg}(f))$ and also satisfies the Erd\H{o}s-Kac Theorem. Finally, we prove that the functions $\omega_k(f)$ with $k \geq 2$ do not have normal order.</description>

      <title>Counting integer polynomials with several roots of maximal modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for positive integers $H$ and $k \leq n$, we obtain some estimates on the cardinality of the set of monic integer polynomials of degree $n$ and height bounded by $H$ with exactly $k$ roots of maximal modulus. These include lower and upper bounds in terms of $H$ for fixed $k$ and $n$. We also count reducible and irreducible polynomials in that set separately. Our results imply, for instance, that the number of monic integer irreducible polynomials of degree $n$ and height at most $H$ whose all $n$ roots have equal moduli is approximately $2H$ for odd $n$, while for even $n$ there are more than $H^{n/8}$ of such polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Artin formalism for triple product $p$-adic $L$-functions: Chow--Heegner points vs. Heegner points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main objective in this paper (which is expository for the most part) is to study the necessary steps to prove a factorization formula for a certain triple product $p$-adic $L$-function guided by the Artin formalism. The key ingredients are: a) the explicit reciprocity laws governing the relationship of diagonal cycles and generalized Heegner cycles to $p$-adic $L$-functions; b) a careful comparison of Chow--Heegner points and twisted Heegner points in Hida families, via formulae of Gross--Zagier type.</description>

      <title>Eventual tightness of projective dimension growth bounds: quadratic in the degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In projective dimension growth results, one bounds the number of rational points of height at most $H$ on an irreducible hypersurface in $\mathbb P^n$ of degree $d&gt;3$ by $C(n)d^2 H^{n-1}(\log H)^{M(n)}$, where the quadratic dependence in $d$ has been recently obtained by Binyamini, Cluckers and Kato in 2024 [1]. For these bounds, it was already shown by Castryck, Cluckers, Dittmann and Nguyen in 2020 [3] that one cannot do better than a linear dependence in $d$. In this paper we show that, for the mentioned projective dimension growth bounds, the quadratic dependence in $d$ is eventually tight when $n$ grows. More precisely the upper bounds cannot be better than $c(n)d^{2-2/n} H^{n-1}$ in general. Note that for affine dimension growth (for affine hypersurfaces of degree $d$, satisfying some extra conditions), the dependence on $d$ is also quadratic by [1], which is already known to be optimal by [3]. Our projective case thus complements the picture of tightness for dimension growth bounds for hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties over finite fields with commutative endomorphism algebra: theory and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a categorical description of all abelian varieties with commutative endomorphism ring over a finite field with $q=p^a$ elements in a fixed isogeny class in terms of pairs consisting of a fractional $\mathbb Z[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal and a fractional $W\otimes_{\mathbb Z_p} \mathbb Z_p[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal, with $\pi$ the Frobenius endomorphism and $W$ the ring of integers in an unramified extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ of degree $a$. The latter ideal should be compatible at $p$ with the former and stable under the action of a semilinear Frobenius (and Verschiebung) operator; it will be the Dieudonn\'e module of the corresponding abelian variety. Using this categorical description we create effective algorithms to compute isomorphism classes of these objects and we produce many new examples exhibiting exotic patterns.</description>

      <title>Prime Splitting and Common Index Divisors in Radical Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly describe the splitting of odd integral primes in the radical extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{a})$, where $x^n-a$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Our motivation is to classify common index divisors, the primes whose splitting prevents the existence of a power integral basis for the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{a})$. Among other results, we show that if $p$ is such a prime, even or otherwise, then $p\mid n$.</description>

      <title>Almost all primes are not needed in Ternary Goldbach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ternary Goldbach conjecture states that every odd number $m \geqslant 7$ can be written as the sum of three primes. We construct a set of primes $\mathbb{P}$ defined by an expanding system of admissible congruences such that almost all primes are not in $\mathbb{P}$ and still, the ternary Goldbach conjecture holds true with primes restricted to $\mathbb{P}$.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Proof of Hrushovski's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his paper on the Mordell-Lang conjecture, Hrushovski employed techniques from model theory to prove the function field version of the conjecture. In doing so he was able to answer a related question of Voloch, which we refer to henceforth as Hrushovski's theorem. In this paper we shall give an alternative proof of said theorem in the characteristic $p$ setting, but using purely algebro-geometric ideas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a two-dimensional $\mathbb F_p$-Selberg integral formula, in which the two-dimensional $\mathbb F_p$-Selberg integral $\bar S(a,b,c;l_1,l_2)$ depends on positive integer parameters $a,b,c$, $l_1,l_2$ and is an element of the finite field $\mathbb F_p$ with odd prime number $p$ of elements. The formula is motivated by the analogy between multidimensional hypergeometric solutions of the KZ equations and polynomial solutions of the same equations reduced modulo $p$.</description>

      <title>An Attack on $p$-adic Lattice Public-key Cryptosystems and Signature Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattices have many significant applications in cryptography. In 2021, the $p$-adic signature scheme and public-key encryption cryptosystem were introduced. They are based on the Longest Vector Problem (LVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP) in $p$-adic lattices. These problems are considered to be challenging and there are no known deterministic polynomial time algorithms to solve them. In this paper, we improve the LVP algorithm in local fields. The modified LVP algorithm is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm when the field is totally ramified and $p$ is a polynomial in the rank of the input lattice. We utilize this algorithm to attack the above schemes so that we are able to forge a valid signature of any message and decrypt any ciphertext. Although these schemes are broken, this work does not mean that $p$-adic lattices are not suitable in constructing cryptographic primitives. We propose some possible modifications to avoid our attack at the end of this paper.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ be an algebraically closed perfectoid field over $\Qp$ with the ring of integer $\calO_C$ and the infinitesimal thickening $\Ainf$. Let $\frakX$ be a smooth formal scheme over $\calO_C$ with a fixed smooth lifting $\wtx$ over $\Ainf$. Let $X$ be the generic fiber of $\frakX$ and $\wtX$ be its lifting over $\BdRp$ induced by $\wtx$. Let $\MIC_r(\wtX)^{{\rm H-small}}$ and $\rL\rS_r(X,\BBdRp)^{{\rm H-small}}$ be the $v$-stacks of rank-$r$ Hitchin-small integrable connections on $\wtX_{\et}$ and $\BBdRp$-local systems on $X_{v}$, respectively. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between this two stacks by introducing a new period sheaf with connection $(\calO\bB_{\dR,\pd}^+,\rd)$ on $X_{v}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.09865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If K/k is a function field in one variable of positive characteristic, we describe a general algorithm to factor one-variable polynomials with coefficients in K. The algorithm is flexible enough to find factors subject to additional restrictions, e.g., to find all roots that belong to a given finite dimensional k-subspace of K more efficiently. It also provides a deterministic polynomial time irreducibility test in small characteristic. We also discuss some applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory and algorithms necessary to be able to verify the strong Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture for absolutely simple modular abelian varieties over $\mathbf{Q}$. We apply our methods to all 28 Atkin--Lehner quotients of $X_0(N)$ of genus $2$, all 97 genus $2$ curves from the LMFDB whose Jacobian is of this type and six further curves originally found by Wang. We are able to verify the strong BSD Conjecture unconditionally and exactly in all these cases; this is the first time that strong BSD has been confirmed for absolutely simple abelian varieties of dimension at least $2$. We also give an example where we verify that the order of the Tate--Shafarevich group is $7^2$ and agrees with the order predicted by the BSD Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Construction of Permutation Polynomials over Finite Fields with the help of SCR polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we take a deeper look at the self conjugate reciprocal (SCR) polynomials, which towards the end of the paper aid the construction of new classes of permutation polynomials of simpler forms over $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}$. The paper focuses on the conditions required for a certain class of degree 2 and degree 3 SCR polynomials to have no roots in $\mu_{q+1}$ (the set of $(q+1)-\emph{th}$ roots of unity), which helps in the determination of polynomials that permute $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}$. In the due course we also look upon some higher degree SCR polynomials which can be reduced down to a degree 2 SCR polynomial over both odd and even ordered fields. We further look upon the SCR polynomials of type $ax^{q+1}+bx^{q}+bx+a^{q}$ taking both the cases under consideration viz. $a\in \mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $a\in\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}\setminus\mathbb{F}_{q}$ both.</description>

Abstract: The KZ equations are differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the $n$-point functions of affine primary fields. In [SV1] the KZ equations were identified with equations for flat sections of suitable Gauss-Manin connections, and solutions of the KZ equations were constructed in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In [SV2] the KZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$, and, for rational levels, polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ were constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we study in detail the first nontrivial example of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$. In particular, if the level is irrational, we prove a version of the steepest descent result that relates the KZ local system to the space of functions on the critical locus of the master function. We use this result to prove the generic irreducibility of the KZ local system at any irrational level. If the level is rational, we describe all solutions of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Finally, we prove a Lagrangian property of the subbundle of the KZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections.</description>

Abstract: We show that Submonoid Membership is decidable in n-dimensional lamplighter groups $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) \wr \mathbb{Z}^n$ for any prime $p$ and integer $n$. More generally, we show decidability of Submonoid Membership in semidirect products of the form $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$, where $\mathcal{Y}$ is any finitely presented module over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$. Combined with a result of Shafrir (2024), this gives the first example of a group $G$ and a finite index subgroup $\widetilde{G} \leq G$, such that Submonoid Membership is decidable in $\widetilde{G}$ but undecidable in $G$.
  To obtain our decidability result, we reduce Submonoid Membership in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ to solving S-unit equations over $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$-modules. We show that the solution set of such equations is effectively $p$-automatic, extending a result of Adamczewski and Bell (2012). As an intermediate result, we also obtain that the solution set of the Knapsack Problem in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ is effectively $p$-automatic.</description>
