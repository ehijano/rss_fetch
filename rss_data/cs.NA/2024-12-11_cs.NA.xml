      <title>Robust globally divergence-free WG finite element method for steady thermally coupled incompressible MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method of arbitrary order for the steady thermally coupled incompressible Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) flow. The WG scheme uses piecewise polynomials of degrees $k(k\geq 1),k,k-1,k-1$ and $k$ respectively for the approximations of the velocity, the magnetic field, the pressure, the magnetic pseudo-pressure, and the temperature in the interior of elements, and uses piecewise polynomials of degrees $l(l =k-1,k),k,k,k$ and $l$ for the numerical traces of velocity, the magnetic fields, the pressure, the magnetic pseudo-pressure, and the temperature on the interfaces of elements. The method is shown to yield globally divergence-free approximations of the velocity and magnetic fields. We give existence and uniqueness results for the discrete scheme and derive optimal a priori error estimates. We also present a convergent linearized iterative algorithm. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Bravais Lattices for Euclidean Degree Efficient Polynomial Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is presented for forming polynomial interpolants on squares and cubes, which are more efficient in the so-called Euclidean degree than other commonly used methods with the same number of collocation points. These methods have several additional desirable properties. The interpolants can be formed and evaluated via the FFT and have a minimally growing Lebesgue constant. The associated points achieve Gauss-Lobatto order accuracy in integration, out-performing tensor product Gauss-Legendre integration for many $C_\infty$ functions.
  This method is related to prior work on total degree efficient collocation points by Yuan Xu et al. [arXiv:math/0604604] [arXiv:0808:0180]</description>

      <title>Strong Convergence of a Splitting Method for the Stochastic Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the numerical approximation of the stochastic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with additive noise on the one dimensional torus. The complex nature of the equation means that many of the standard approaches developed for stochastic partial differential equations can not be directly applied. We use an energy approach to prove an existence and uniqueness result as well to obtain moment bounds on the stochastic PDE before introducing our numerical discretization. For such a well studied deterministic equation it is perhaps surprising that its numerical approximation in the stochastic setting has not been considered before. Our method is based on a spectral discretization in space and a Lie-Trotter splitting method in time. We obtain moment bounds for the numerical method before proving our main result: strong convergence on a set of arbitrarily large probability. From this we obtain a result on convergence in probability. We conclude with some numerical experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a closed-form solution to the inverse problem in interpolation with periodic uniform B-spline curves. This solution is obtained by modifying the one we have established to a similar problem with relaxed uniform B-spline curves. Then we use these solutions to determine the maximum curvature of a B\'{e}zier-spline curve. Our computational and graphical examples are presented with the aid of Maple procedures.</description>

      <title>A class of refined implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods with robust time adaptability and unconditional convergence for the Cahn-Hilliard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of main obstacles in verifying the energy dissipation laws of implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IERK) methods for phase field equations is to establish the uniform boundedness of stage solutions without the global Lipschitz continuity assumption of nonlinear bulk. With the help of discrete orthogonal convolution kernels, an updated time-space splitting technique is developed to establish the uniform boundedness of stage solutions for a refined class of IERK methods in which the associated differentiation matrices and the average dissipation rates are always independent of the time-space discretization meshes. This makes the refined IERK methods highly advantageous in self-adaptive time-stepping procedures as some larger adaptive step-sizes in actual simulations become possible. From the perspective of optimizing the average dissipation rate, we construct some parameterized refined IERK methods up to third-order accuracy, in which the involved diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods for the implicit part have an explicit first stage and allow a stage-order of two such that they are not necessarily algebraically stable. Then we are able to establish, for the first time, the original energy dissipation law and the unconditional $L^2$ norm convergence. Extensive numerical tests are presented to support our theory.</description>

      <title>A unified framework on the original energy laws of three effective classes of Runge-Kutta methods for phase field crystal type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main theoretical obstacle to establish the original energy dissipation laws of Runge-Kutta methods for phase-field equations is to verify the maximum norm boundedness of the stage solutions without assuming global Lipschitz continuity of the nonlinear bulk. We present a unified theoretical framework for the energy stability of three effective classes of Runge-Kutta methods, including the additive implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta, explicit exponential Runge-Kutta and corrected integrating factor Runge-Kutta methods, for the Swift-Hohenberg and phase field crystal models. By the standard discrete energy argument, it is proven that the three classes of Runge-Kutta methods preserve the original energy dissipation laws if the associated differentiation matrices are positive definite. Our main tools include the differential form with the associated differentiation matrix, the discrete orthogonal convolution kernels and the principle of mathematical induction. Many existing Runge-Kutta methods in the literature are revisited by evaluating the lower bound on the minimum eigenvalues of the associated differentiation matrices. Our theoretical approach paves a new way for the internal nonlinear stability of Runge-Kutta methods for dissipative semilinear parabolic problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the Galerkin approximation and analysis for a hyperbolic integrodifferential equation, where the non-positive variable-sign kernel and nonlinear-nonlocal damping with both the weak and viscous damping effects are involved. We derive the long-time stability of the solution and its finite-time uniqueness. For the semi-discrete-in-space Galerkin scheme, we derive the long-time stability of the semi-discrete numerical solution and its finite-time error estimate by technical splitting of intricate terms. Then we further apply the centering difference method and the interpolating quadrature to construct a fully discrete Galerkin scheme and prove the long-time stability of the numerical solution and its finite-time error estimate by designing a new semi-norm. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is a powerful tool for solving discrete ill-posed problems. In this paper, we propose a two-sided uniformly randomized GSVD algorithm for solving the large-scale discrete ill-posed problem with the general Tikhonov regularization. Based on two-sided uniform random sampling, the proposed algorithm can improve the efficiency with less computing time and memory requirement and obtain expected accuracy. The error analysis for the proposed algorithm is also derived. Finally, we report some numerical examples to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A data-driven learned discretization approach in finite volume schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws and varying boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven finite volume method for solving 1D and 2D hyperbolic partial differential equations. This work builds upon the prior research incorporating a data-driven finite-difference approximation of smooth solutions of scalar conservation laws, where optimal coefficients of neural networks approximating space derivatives are learned based on accurate, but cumbersome solutions to these equations. We extend this approach to flux-limited finite volume schemes for hyperbolic scalar and systems of conservation laws. We also train the discretization to efficiently capture discontinuous solutions with shock and contact waves, as well as to the application of boundary conditions. The learning procedure of the data-driven model is extended through the definition of a new loss, paddings and adequate database. These new ingredients guarantee computational stability, preserve the accuracy of fine-grid solutions, and enhance overall performance. Numerical experiments using test cases from the literature in both one- and two-dimensional spaces demonstrate that the learned model accurately reproduces fine-grid results on very coarse meshes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces finite element methods for a class of elliptic fully nonlinear partial differential equations. They are based on a minimal residual principle that builds upon the Alexandrov--Bakelman--Pucci estimate. Under rather general structural assumptions on the operator, convergence of $C^1$ conforming and discontinuous Galerkin methods is proven in the $L^\infty$ norm. Numerical experiments on the performance of adaptive mesh refinement driven by local information of the residual in two and three space dimensions are provided.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin methods for the complete stochastic Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, stochastic effects have become increasingly relevant for describing fluid behaviour, particularly in the context of turbulence. The most important model for inviscid fluids in computational fluid dynamics are the Euler equations of gas dynamics which we focus on in this paper. To take stochastic effects into account, we incorporate a stochastic forcing term in the momentum equation of the Euler system. To solve the extended system, we apply an entropy dissipative discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method including the Finite Volume setting, adjust it to the stochastic Euler equations and analyze its convergence properties. Our analysis is grounded in the concept of dissipative martingale solutions, as recently introduced by Moyo (J. Diff. Equ. 365, 408-464, 2023). Assuming no vacuum formation and bounded total energy, we proof that our scheme converges in law to a dissipative martingale solution. During the lifespan of a pathwise strong solution, we achieve convergence of at least order 1/2, measured by the expected $L^1$ norm of the relative energy. The results built a counterpart of corresponding results in the deterministic case. In numerical simulations, we show the robustness of our scheme, visualise different stochastic realizations and analyze our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Multilevel randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator for nested integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nested integration problems arise in various scientific and engineering applications, including Bayesian experimental design, financial risk assessment, and uncertainty quantification. These nested integrals take the form $\int f\left(\int g(\bs{y},\bs{x})\di{}\bs{x}\right)\di{}\bs{y}$, for nonlinear $f$, making them computationally challenging, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Although widely used for single integrals, traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods can be inefficient when encountering complexities of nested integration. This work introduces a novel multilevel estimator, combining deterministic and randomized quasi-MC (rQMC) methods to handle nested integration problems efficiently. In this context, the inner number of samples and the discretization accuracy of the inner integrand evaluation constitute the level. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the estimator, deriving error bounds demonstrating significant reductions in bias and variance compared with standard methods. The proposed estimator is particularly effective in scenarios where the integrand is evaluated approximately, as it adapts to different levels of resolution without compromising precision. We verify the performance of our method via numerical experiments, focusing on estimating the expected information gain of experiments. We further introduce a truncation scheme to address the eventual unboundedness of the experimental noise. When applied to Gaussian noise in the estimator, this truncation scheme renders the same computational complexity as in the bounded noise case up to multiplicative logarithmic terms. The results reveal that the proposed multilevel rQMC estimator outperforms existing MC and rQMC approaches, offering a substantial reduction in computational costs and offering a powerful tool for practitioners dealing with complex, nested integration problems across various domains.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Convergence and Asymptotic Analysis for a Diffuse Domain Problem with Transmission Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse domain methods (DDMs) have garnered significant attention for approximating solutions to partial differential equations on complex geometries. These methods implicitly represent the geometry by replacing the sharp boundary interface with a diffuse layer of thickness $\varepsilon$, which scales with the minimum grid size. This approach reformulates the original equations on an extended regular domain, incorporating boundary conditions through singular source terms. In this work, we conduct a matched asymptotic analysis of a DDM for a two-sided problem with transmission Robin boundary conditions. Our results show that, in one dimension, the solution of the diffuse domain approximation asymptotically converges to the solution of the original problem, with exactly first-order accuracy in $\varepsilon$. We provide numerical simulations that validate and illustrate the analytical result. Furthermore, for the Neumann boundary condition case, we show that the associated energy functional of the diffuse domain approximation $\Gamma-$convergences to the energy functional of the original problem, and the solution of the diffuse domain approximation strongly converges, up to a subsequence, to the solution of the original problem in $H^1(\Omega)$, as $\varepsilon \to 0$.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enhanced Preconditioning for Efficient Conjugate Gradient Solvers in Large-Scale PDE Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preconditioning techniques are crucial for enhancing the efficiency of solving large-scale linear equation systems that arise from partial differential equation (PDE) discretization. These techniques, such as Incomplete Cholesky factorization (IC) and data-driven neural network methods, accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers like Conjugate Gradient (CG) by approximating the original matrices. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) with traditional IC, addressing the shortcomings of direct generation methods based on GNN and achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate an average reduction in iteration counts by 24.8% compared to IC and a two-order-of-magnitude increase in training scale compared to previous methods. A three-dimensional static structural analysis utilizing finite element methods was validated on training sparse matrices of up to 5 million dimensions and inference scales of up to 10 million. Furthermore, the approach demon-strates robust generalization capabilities across scales, facilitating the effective acceleration of CG solvers for large-scale linear equations using small-scale data on modest hardware. The method's robustness and scalability make it a practical solution for computational science.</description>

      <title>Image Classification Using Singular Value Decomposition and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of Singular Value Decomposition for the image classification of specific breeds of cats and dogs using fur color as the primary identifying feature. Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is employed to construct optimally weighted templates. The proposed method achieves 69% accuracy using the Frobenius norm at rank 10. The results partially validate the assumption that dominant features, such as fur color, can be effectively captured through low-rank approximations. However, the accuracy suggests that additional features or methods may be required for more robust classification, highlighting the trade-off between simplicity and performance in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Comparison of the Total Focusing Method, Reverse Time Migration, and Full Waveform Inversion for Ultrasonic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phased array ultrasound is a widely used technique in non-destructive testing. Using piezoelectric elements as both sources and receivers provides a significant gain in information and enables more accurate defect detection. When all source-receiver combinations are used, the process is called full matrix capture. The total focusing method~(TFM), which exploits such datasets, relies on a delay and sum algorithm to sum up the signals on a pixel grid. However, TFM only uses the first arriving p-waves, making it challenging to size complex-shaped defects. By contrast, more advanced methods such as reverse time migration~(RTM) and full waveform inversion~(FWI) use full waveforms to reconstruct defects. Both methods compare measured signals with ultrasound simulations. While RTM identifies defects by convolving forward and backward wavefields once, FWI iteratively updates material models to reconstruct the actual distribution of material properties. This study compares TFM, RTM, and FWI for six specimens featuring circular defects or Y-shaped notches. The reconstructed results are first evaluated qualitatively using different thresholds and then quantitatively using metrics such as AUPRC, AUROC, and F1-score. The results show that FWI performs best in most cases, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>A Robust Sustainability Assessment Methodology for Aircraft Parts: Application to a Fuselage Panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a cradle-to-gate sustainability assessment methodology specifically designed to evaluate aircraft components in a robust and systematic manner. This methodology integrates multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis across ten criteria, categorized under environmental impact, cost, and performance. Environmental impact is analyzed through life cycle assessment and cost through life cycle costing, with both analyses facilitated by SimaPro software. Performance is measured in terms of component mass and specific stiffness. The robustness of this methodology is tested through various MCDM techniques, normalization approaches, and objective weighting methods. To demonstrate the methodology, the paper assesses the sustainability of a fuselage panel, comparing nine variants that differ in materials, joining techniques, and part thicknesses. All approaches consistently identify thermoplastic CFRP panels as the most sustainable option, with the geometric mean aggregation of weights providing balanced criteria consideration across environmental, cost, and performance aspects. The adaptability of this proposed methodology is illustrated, showing its applicability to any aircraft component with the requisite data. This structured approach offers critical insights to support sustainable decision-making in aircraft component design and procurement.</description>

      <title>Parallel simulation for sampling under isoperimetry and score-based diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in proving discretization bounds for sampling under isoperimetry and for diffusion models. As data size grows, reducing the iteration cost becomes an important goal. Inspired by the great success of the parallel simulation of the initial value problem in scientific computation, we propose parallel Picard methods for sampling tasks. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves better dependence on dimension $d$ than prior works in iteration complexity (i.e., reduced from $\widetilde{O}(\log^2 d)$ to $\widetilde{O}(\log d)$), which is even optimal for sampling under isoperimetry with specific iteration complexity. Our work highlights the potential advantages of simulation methods in scientific computation for dynamics-based sampling and diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Image Reconstruction in Cone Beam Computed Tomography Using Controlled Gradient Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Total variation (TV) regularization is a popular reconstruction method for ill-posed imaging problems, and particularly useful for applications with piecewise constant targets. However, using TV for medical cone-beam computed X-ray tomography (CBCT) has been limited so far, mainly due to heavy computational loads at clinically relevant 3D resolutions and the difficulty in choosing the regularization parameter. Here an efficient minimization algorithm is presented, combined with a dynamic parameter adjustment based on control theory. The result is a fully automatic 3D reconstruction method running in clinically acceptable time. The input on top of projection data and system geometry is desired degree of sparsity of the reconstruction. This can be determined from an atlas of CT scans, or alternatively used as an easily adjustable parameter with straightforward interpretation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Dynamic Models Hybridisation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-based dynamic models (PBDMs) are simplified representations of complex dynamical systems. PBDMs take specific processes within a complex system and assign a fragment of variables and an accompanying set of parameters to depict the processes. As this often leads to suboptimal parameterisation of the system, a key challenge requires refining the empirical parameters and variables to reduce uncertainties while maintaining the model s explainability and enhancing its predictive accuracy. We demonstrate that a hybrid mosquito population dynamics model, which integrates a PBDM with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), retains the explainability of the PBDM by incorporating the PINN-learned model parameters in place of its empirical counterparts. Specifically, we address the limitations of traditional PBDMs by modelling the parameters of larva and pupa development rates using a PINN that encodes complex, learned interactions of air temperature, precipitation and humidity. Our results demonstrate improved mosquito population simulations including the difficult-to-predict mosquito population peaks. This opens the possibility of hybridisation concept application on other complex systems based on PBDMs such as cancer growth to address the challenges posed by scarce and noisy data, and to numerical weather prediction and climate modelling to overcome the gap between physics-based and data-driven weather prediction models.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of a Preconditioned Steepest Descent Solver for the Cahn-Hilliard Equation with Logarithmic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis for a preconditioned steepest descent (PSD) iterative solver that improves the computational time of a finite difference numerical scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard equation with Flory-Huggins energy potential. In the numerical design, a convex splitting approach is applied to the chemical potential such that the logarithmic and the surface diffusion terms are treated implicitly while the expansive concave term is treated with an explicit update. The nonlinear and singular nature of the logarithmic energy potential makes the numerical implementation very challenging. However, the positivity-preserving property for the logarithmic arguments, unconditional energy stability, and optimal rate error estimates have been established in a recent work and it has been shown that successful solvers ensure a similar positivity-preserving property at each iteration stage. Therefore, in this work, we will show that the PSD solver ensures a positivity-preserving property at each iteration stage. The PSD solver consists of first computing a search direction (involved with solving a Poisson-like equation) and then takes a one-parameter optimization step over the search direction in which the Newton iteration becomes very powerful. A theoretical analysis is applied to the PSD iteration solver and a geometric convergence rate is proved for the iteration. In particular, the strict separation property of the numerical solution, which indicates a uniform distance between the numerical solution and the singular limit values of $\pm 1$ for the phase variable, plays an essential role in the iteration convergence analysis. A few numerical results are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the PSD solver.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we address the numerical solutions of high-order asymptotic equivalent partial differential equations with the results of a lattice Boltzmann scheme for an inhomogeneous advection problem in one spatial dimension. We first derive a family of equivalent partial differential equations at various orders, and we compare the lattice Boltzmann experimental results with a spectral approximation of the differential equations. For an unsteady situation, we show that the initialization scheme at a sufficiently high order of the microscopic moments plays a crucial role to observe an asymptotic error consistent with the order of approximation. For a stationary long-time limit, we observe that the measured asymptotic error converges with a reduced order of precision compared to the one suggested by asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <title>Summing divergent matrix series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend several celebrated methods in classical analysis for summing series of complex numbers to series of complex matrices. These include the summation methods of Abel, Borel, Ces\'aro, Euler, Lambert, N\"orlund, and Mittag-Leffler, which are frequently used to sum scalar series that are divergent in the conventional sense. One feature of our matrix extensions is that they are fully noncommutative generalizations of their scalar counterparts -- not only is the scalar series replaced by a matrix series, positive weights are replaced by positive definite matrix weights, order on $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by Loewner order, exponential function replaced by matrix exponential function, etc. We will establish the regularity of our matrix summation methods, i.e., when applied to a matrix series convergent in the conventional sense, we obtain the same value for the sum. Our second goal is to provide numerical algorithms that work in conjunction with these summation methods. We discuss how the block and mixed-block summation algorithms, the Kahan compensated summation algorithm, may be applied to matrix sums with similar roundoff error bounds. These summation methods and algorithms apply not only to power or Taylor series of matrices but to any general matrix series including matrix Fourier and Dirichlet series. We will demonstrate the utility of these summation methods: establishing a Fej\'{e}r's theorem and alleviating the Gibbs phenomenon for matrix Fourier series; extending the domains of matrix functions and accurately evaluating them; enhancing the matrix Pad\'e approximation and Schur--Parlett algorithms; and more.</description>

      <title>An improved Shifted CholeskyQR based on columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among all the deterministic CholeskyQR-type algorithms, Shifted CholeskyQR3 is specifically designed to address the QR factorization of ill-conditioned matrices. This algorithm introduces a shift parameter $s$ to prevent failure during the initial Cholesky factorization step, making the choice of this parameter critical for the algorithm's effectiveness. Our goal is to identify a smaller $s$ compared to the traditional selection based on $\norm{X}_{2}$. In this research, we propose a new matrix norm called the $g$-norm, which is based on the column properties of $X$. This norm allows us to obtain a reduced shift parameter $s$ for the Shifted CholeskyQR3 algorithm, thereby improving the sufficient condition of $\kappa_{2}(X)$ for this method. We provide rigorous proofs of orthogonality and residuals for the improved algorithm using our proposed $s$. Numerical experiments confirm the enhanced numerical stability of orthogonality and residuals with the reduced $s$. We find that Shifted CholeskyQR3 can effectively handle ill-conditioned $X$ with a larger $\kappa_{2}(X)$ when using our reduced $s$ compared to the original $s$. Furthermore, we compare CPU times with other algorithms to assess performance improvements.</description>

Abstract: Randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) is an algorithm for constructing a low-rank approximation of a positive-semidefinite matrix using a small number of columns. This paper develops an accelerated version of RPCholesky that employs block matrix computations and rejection sampling to efficiently simulate the execution of the original algorithm. For the task of approximating a kernel matrix, the accelerated algorithm can run over $40\times$ faster. The paper contains implementation details, theoretical guarantees, experiments on benchmark data sets, and an application to computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of a semi-implicit time Euler scheme for a 2D B\'enard-Boussinesq model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a semi-implicit time Euler scheme for the two-dimensional B\'enard-Boussinesq model on the torus D converges. The rate of convergence in probability is almost 1/2 for a multiplicative noise; this relies on moment estimates in various norms for the processes and the scheme.
  In case of an additive noise, due to the coupling of the equations, provided that the difference on temperature between the top and bottom parts of the torus is not too big compared to the viscosity and thermal diffusivity, a strong polynomial rate of convergence (almost 1/2) is proven in $(L^2(D))^2$ for the velocity and in $L^2(D)$ for the temperature.
  It depends on exponential moments of the scheme; due to linear terms involving the other quantity in both evolution equations, the proof has to be done simultaneaously for both the velocity and the temperature. These rates in both cases are similar to that obtained for the Navier-Stokes equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a workhorse algorithm for solving large-scale optimization problems in data science and machine learning. Understanding the convergence of SGD is hence of fundamental importance. In this work we examine the SGD convergence (with various step sizes) when applied to unconstrained convex quadratic programming (essentially least-squares (LS) problems), and in particular analyze the error components respect to the eigenvectors of the Hessian. The main message is that the convergence depends largely on the corresponding eigenvalues (singular values of the coefficient matrix in the LS context), namely the components for the large singular values converge faster in the initial phase. We then show there is a phase transition in the convergence where the convergence speed of the components, especially those corresponding to the larger singular values, will decrease. Finally, we show that the convergence of the overall error (in the solution) tends to decay as more iterations are run, that is, the initial convergence is faster than the asymptote.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the mathematical analyses of the diffusion model in machine learning. The drift term of the backward sampling process is represented as a conditional expectation involving the data distribution and the forward diffusion. The training process aims to find such a drift function by minimizing the mean-squared residue related to the conditional expectation. Using small-time approximations of the Green's function of the forward diffusion, we show that the analytical mean drift function in DDPM and the score function in SGM asymptotically blow up in the final stages of the sampling process for singular data distributions such as those concentrated on lower-dimensional manifolds, and are therefore difficult to approximate by a network. To overcome this difficulty, we derive a new target function and associated loss, which remains bounded even for singular data distributions. We validate the theoretical findings with several numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks solve partial differential equations by training neural networks. Since this method approximates infinite-dimensional PDE solutions with finite collocation points, minimizing discretization errors by selecting suitable points is essential for accelerating the learning process. Inspired by number theoretic methods for numerical analysis, we introduce good lattice training and periodization tricks, which ensure the conditions required by the theory. Our experiments demonstrate that GLT requires 2-7 times fewer collocation points, resulting in lower computational cost, while achieving competitive performance compared to typical sampling methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent evolution of software and hardware technologies is leading to a renewed computational interest in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods such as the Material Point Method (MPM). Indeed, provided some critical aspects are properly handled, PIC methods can be cast in formulations suitable for the requirements of data locality and fine-grained parallelism of modern hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Such a rapid and continuous technological development increases also the importance of generic and portable implementations. While the capabilities of MPM on a wide range continuum mechanics problem have been already well assessed, the use of the method in compressible fluid dynamics has received less attention. In this paper we present a portable, highly parallel, GPU based MPM solver for compressible gas dynamics. The implementation aims to reach a good compromise between portability and efficiency in order to provide a first assessment of the potential of this approach in solving strongly compressible gas flow problems, also taking into account solid obstacles. The numerical model considered constitutes a first step towards the development of a monolithic MPM solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems at all Mach numbers up to the supersonic regime.</description>

Abstract: Automatic differentiation is everywhere, but there exists only minimal documentation of how it works in complex arithmetic beyond stating "derivatives in $\mathbb{C}^d$" $\cong$ "derivatives in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$" and, at best, shallow references to Wirtinger calculus. Unfortunately, the equivalence $\mathbb{C}^d \cong \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ becomes insufficient as soon as we need to derive custom gradient rules, e.g., to avoid differentiating "through" expensive linear algebra functions or differential equation simulators. To combat such a lack of documentation, this article surveys forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation with complex numbers, covering topics such as Wirtinger derivatives, a modified chain rule, and different gradient conventions while explicitly avoiding holomorphicity and the Cauchy--Riemann equations (which would be far too restrictive). To be precise, we will derive, explain, and implement a complex version of Jacobian-vector and vector-Jacobian products almost entirely with linear algebra without relying on complex analysis or differential geometry. This tutorial is a call to action, for users and developers alike, to take complex values seriously when implementing custom gradient propagation rules -- the manuscript explains how.</description>
