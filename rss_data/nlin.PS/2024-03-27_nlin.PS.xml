      <title>Gain-controlled taming of recurrent modulation instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the recurrence phenomenon characteristic of the nonlinear stage of induced modulational instability in a passive fiber is affected by forcing. An additional linear amplification, even if extremely weak, induces separatrix crossing in correspondence of critical values of the gain around which the recurrence process considerably slows down, switching between dynamical orbits of different kind. We present evidence for such phenomenon in a fiber optics experiment where the gain is finely tuned by means of Raman amplification. A theoretical explanation is also provided that matches almost perfectly with our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 2. Oblique solutions and global bifurcations in a spanwise-extended domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection is a non-equilibrium system in which both buoyancy and shear forces play a role in driving the convective flow. Beyond the onset of convection, the driven dissipative system exhibits chaotic dynamics and turbulence. In a three-dimensional domain extended in both the vertical and the transverse dimensions, Gao et al. (2018) have observed a variety of convection patterns which are not described by linear stability analysis. We investigate the fully non-linear dynamics of vertical convection using a dynamical-systems approach based on the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. We compute the invariant solutions of these equations and the bifurcations that are responsible for the creation and termination of various branches. We map out a sequence of local bifurcations from the laminar base state, including simultaneous bifurcations involving patterned steady states with different symmetries. This atypical phenomenon of multiple branches simultaneously bifurcating from a single parent branch is explained by the role of D4 symmetry. In addition, two global bifurcations are identified: first, a homoclinic cycle from modulated transverse rolls and second, a robust heteroclinic cycle linking two symmetry-related diamond-roll patterns. These are confirmed by phase space projections as well as the functional form of the divergence of the period close to the bifurcation points. The intricacy of this bifurcation diagram highlights the essential role played by dynamical systems theory and computation in hydrodynamic configurations.</description>
