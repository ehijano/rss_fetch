      <title>Uniqueness Criteria for the Virasoro-Shapiro Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Veneziano amplitude has recently been uniquely bootstrapped from crossing symmetry, faster than power-law falloff at high energies, and a property dubbed level truncation. In this paper we apply this bootstrap approach to fully permutation invariant amplitudes, deriving new deformations of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for graviton scattering in string theory. Superpolynomially soft Regge behavior yields the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude as the unique solution, and we find the string spectrum as an output rather than an input of the bootstrap. While the remaining variations exhibit the same Regge scaling as pure gravity, in the tensionless limit they reproduce remarkable extremal amplitudes that have appeared in bottom-up studies of positivity.</description>

      <title>Long-range to the Rescue of Yang-Baxter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin chain model which captures the one-loop spectral problem of a prototypical example of an $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT in four dimensions. Up to date, this spin chain model remains unfathomable; the coordinate Bethe Ansatz does not lead to a solution from three magnons on, as the Yang-Baxter equation is not satisfied by the two-magnon scattering coefficients. In this paper, we find a long-range solution to the eigenvalue problem for three magnons. Remarkably, the scattering coefficients of our solution together with the position-dependent corrections, obey an infinite tower of Yang-Baxter equations. Our method of solving the three-magnon problem is interesting in its own right and generalizes the coordinate Bethe Ansatz approach to cases where the permutation symmetry is broken.</description>

      <title>Matching and positivity beyond minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-energy effective theories of photons and gravitons, matching them at one loop to a UV completion with a massive spinning matter particle. The matter is allowed to have non-minimal electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. We construct the one-loop 4-photon and 4-graviton helicity amplitudes with matter in the loop carrying anomalous multipole moments, and we read off the Wilson coefficients in the effective theory below the matter particle mass. Much as in the case of minimal coupling, the Wilson coefficients beyond the leading order turn out to be confined to small islands in the much larger theory space allowed by existing positivity constraints.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions I: Graded Influence Actions for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This series of papers has two broader aims: 1) Construct a theory for multi-partite open quantum systems comprising several layers of structure with self-consistent back-actions. Develop the graded influence action formalism \cite{BehHu10,BH11} to account for the influences of successive sub-layers on the dynamics of the variables of interest. 2) Apply these methods to the study of atom-field-medium interactions and highlight their merits over conventional methods. We consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms (A), interacting with a quantum field (F), scalar here, for simplicity, altered by the presence of a dielectric medium (M). In this paper we use the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions in the influence functional formalism to derive the stochastic equations for the reduced density matrices of the dynamical variables in the successive layers of structure. The word `graded' refers to the specific ordering of the coarse-graining procedures. Three layers of coarse-graining are performed, firstly, integrating over the common bath of the dielectric oscillators results not only in the appearance of necessary dissipative properties of the dielectric but also essential nuanced features such as nonMarkovian spatial correlations in the dielectric. Secondly, integrating over the medium variables as a whole results in a dielectric-modified quantum field, the influence of the medium on the quantum field manifesting through a frequency-dependent permittivity function. Finally, integrating over this dielectric-altered quantum field which interacts with the idfs of the atoms yields an influence action. From it we obtain the stochastic equation of motion which describes the nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of the idf of the atoms interacting with a dielectric medium-modified quantum field.</description>

      <title>Background dependent cutoff for Wilson actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the application of the background field method in the framework of the exact renormalization group (ERG). By considering the case of a scalar field theory, we provide a detailed discussion of the properties satisfied by a background dependent Wilson action. We show how the Ward identity associated with background field shifts for the Wilson action is related to that for the 1PI Wilson action, or effective average action. Moreover, we discuss the ERG equations in the dimensionless framework and emphasize the role of the Ward identity in this setting. We give two examples: the Gaussian fixed point for the real scalar theory and the large $N$ limit of the linear sigma model.</description>

      <title>Three-point Functions in Aharony--Bergman--Jafferis--Maldacena Theory and Integrable Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correlators of three single-trace operators in Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory from the perspective of integrable boundary states. Specifically, we focus on scenarios where two operators being $1/3$-BPS and the entire correlation function is considered within the twisted-translated frame. The correlator can be expressed as the overlap between a boundary state and a Bethe state. It is found that the boundary state formed by the two $1/3$-BPS operators is integrable only when the number of Wick contractions between the non-BPS operator and one of the $1/3$-BPS operators is 0 or 1. We compute the overlaps for the integrable cases utilizing the symmetries preserved by the correlators.</description>

      <title>Information theoretic measures for Lifshitz system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied various mixed state information theoretic quantities for an excited state of Lifshitz spacetime in $3+1$-dimensions. This geometry is the gravity dual to a class of $2+1$-dimensional quantum field theories having Lifshitz symmetry. We have holographically calculated mutual information, entanglement wedge cross section, entanglement negativity and mutual complexity for strip like subsystems at the boundary. For this we have used the results of holographic entanglement entropy and complexity present in the literature. We first calculate all of these mentioned quantities for the pure state of Lifshitz spacetime. Then we have moved on to calculate all these quantities for excited state of the Lifshitz spacetime. The gravity dual of excited state of Lifshitz systems in field theory can be obtained by applying constant perturbations along the boundary direction. Further, we would like to mention that for the simplicity of calculation we are only considering results up to the first order in perturbation. The change in the obtained holographic information theoretic quantities are then related to entanglement entropy, entanglement pressure, entanglement chemical potential and charge using the stress tensor complex. These relations are analogous to the first law of entanglement thermodynamics given earlier in the literature. All the calculations are carried out for both values of dynamical scaling exponent ($z$) present in the Lifshitz field theory.</description>

      <title>The massless S-matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contradistinction to the case of massive excitations, the connection between integrability and the tree-level massless scattering matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models is lost. Namely, in well-known 2-d integrable models the tree-level massless S-matrix exhibits particle production and fails to factorise. This is conjectured to happen due to IR ambiguities in the massless tree-level amplitudes. We present a definition of the massless S-matrix which has all the nice properties of integrable theories, there is no particle production and the S-matrix factorises. As an example, we present in detail the case of the $SU(2)$ principal chiral model (PCM).</description>

      <title>Baby universe operators in double-scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the baby universe operator $\mathcal{B}_a$ in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model, which creates a baby universe of size $a$. We find that $\mathcal{B}_a$ is written in terms of the transfer matrix $T$, and vice versa. In particular, the identity operator on the chord Hilbert space is expanded as a linear combination of $\mathcal{B}_a$, which implies that the disk partition function of DSSYK is written as a linear combination of trumpets. We also find that the thermofield double state of DSSYK is generated by a pair of baby universe operators, which corresponds to a double trumpet. This can be thought of as a concrete realization of the idea of ER=EPR.</description>

      <title>4D de Sitter from String Theory via 6D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain de Sitter (dS) solutions from controlled string-theory constructions. We review how minimal gauged chiral 6D supergravity evades standard dS no-go theorems by having a positive scalar potential and describe the known 4D classical dS, AdS and Minkowski solutions. Grimm and collaborators recently found a related 6D supergravity by direct F-theory Calabi-Yau flux compactifications and we construct classical 4D maximally symmetric solutions for this 6D supergravity. These provide explicit solutions of the higher-dimensional field equations corresponding to dS, AdS and flat spacetimes in 4D, allowing interesting hierarchies of scales. We show how the singularities of these solutions are consistent with the back-reaction of two space-filling 4D brane-like sources situated within the extra dimensions and infer some of the properties of these sources using the formalism of point particle effective field theory (PPEFT), showing the sources are not vanilla objects like D branes. These tools relate the near-source asymptotic forms of bulk fields to source properties and have been extensively tested for more prosaic physical systems involving the back-reaction of small sources, such as the dependence of atomic energy levels on nuclear properties. We use it to determine the tension of the brane-like sources (that can be positive) and its derivatives. We verify that the solutions are in the weak coupling/large volume regime required to neglect quantum and $\alpha'$ effects.</description>

      <title>Electric/magnetic duality of dyonic Kerr-Newman-NUT-AdS spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the (anti-)self-duality conditions under which the electric and magnetic parts of the conserved charges of the dyonic Kerr-Newman-NUT-AdS solution become equivalent. Within a holographic framework, the stress tensor and the boundary Cotton tensor are computed from the electric/magnetic content of the Weyl tensor. The holographic stress tensor/Cotton tensor duality is recovered along the (anti-)self-dual curve in parameter space. We show that the latter not only implies a duality relation for the mass but also for the angular momentum. The partition function is computed to first order in the saddle-point approximation and a BPS bound is obtained. The ground state of the theory is enlarged to all the (anti-)self-dual configurations when the $SO(4)$ and $U(1)$ Pontryagin densities are introduced. We demonstrate this at the level of the action and variations thereof.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy in Non-Supersymmetric Quasi-Realistic Heterotic-String Vacua with Fixed Moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Baykara, Tarazi and Vafa discussed the existence of quasicrystalline string vacua that contain a single neutral moduli, the dilaton, and studied compactifications of the non-supersymmetric $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ heterotic-string on these spaces. We discuss a specific class of quasi-realistic string vacua with similar properties that has been known since the late eighties and analyse the vacuum energy in several non-supersymmetric examples that correspond to compactifications of tachyon free ten dimensional vacua as well as compactifications of tachyonic ten dimensional vacua. Our analysis uses the Free Fermionic Formalism of the heterotic-string in four dimensions and employs asymmetric boundary conditions that project all the geometrical moduli by Generalised GSO projections. This methodology produces models with both positive and negative spacetime potential at one-loop.</description>

      <title>Dimension-8 SMEFT contact-terms for vector-pair production via on-shell Higgsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the dimension-8 standard-model effective theory (SMEFT) contact terms relevant for vector-pair production at the LHC and lepton colliders. We first list the relevant dimension-8 massless SMEFT amplitudes, and then obtain the low-energy amplitudes using on-shell Higgsing. In all cases, the contributions we calculate are the leading-order contributions to 4-point contact-terms; the dimension-6 SMEFT merely corrects the three-point couplings entering the amplitudes. Since they are given in terms of physical quantities, namely momenta and polarizations, the results allow for a direct mapping of EFT effects to low-energy observables. The vector amplitudes are sensitive to both anomalous vector couplings and Higgs self-couplings. The left-handed fermion amplitudes feature SU(2) violating effects first generated at dimension-8. We also compare our results to HEFT predictions. Interestingly, the dimension-8 SMEFT populates almost all the novel structures generated by the dimension-8 HEFT.</description>

      <title>Field Redefinitions in Classical Field Theory with some Quantum Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theories, field redefinitions are often employed to remove redundant operators in the Lagrangian, making calculations simpler and physics more evident. This technique requires some care regarding, among other things, the choice of observables, the range of applicability, and the appearance and disappearance of solutions of the equations of motion (EOM). Many of these issues can already be studied at the classical level, which is the focus of this work. We highlight the importance of selecting appropriate observables and initial/boundary conditions to ensure the physical invariance of solutions. A classical analogue to the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann (LSZ) formula is presented, confirming that some observables remain independent of field variables without tracking redefinitions. Additionally, we address, with an example, the limitations of non-invertible field redefinitions, particularly with non-perturbative objects like solitons, and discuss their implications for classical and quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Effective Theory for Partons in the Spirit of Steven Weinberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard formulation of parton physics involves light-cone correlations of quark and gluon fields in a hadron, which leads to a widespread impression that it can only be studied through real-time Hamiltonian dynamics or light-front quantization, which are challenged by non-perturbative computations with a pertinent regulator for light-cone/rapidity divergences (or zero modes). As such, standard lattice QCD studies have been limited to indirect parton observables such as first few moments and short-distance correlations, which do not provide the $x$-distributions without solving the model-dependent inverse problem. Here I describe an alternative formulation of partons in terms of equal-time (or Euclidean) correlators, which allows to compute precision-controlled $x$-distribution through lattice QCD simulations. This approach is in accord with Weinberg's pioneering idea of effective field theory as well as Wilson's renormalization group, in which the large hadron momentum serves as a natural cut-off for light-cone/rapidity divergences and can ultimately be eliminated through a method like the ``perfect action'' program in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes In The Presence of Axion Field Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of long wavelength entropy fluctuations on cosmological probes such as galaxy clustering, luminosity distance, and CMB temperature anisotropies. Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator scalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the radiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on observables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at the time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\eta^{-2}$ where $\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important for CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed. In particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble tension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a lot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than momentum space.</description>

      <title>Spacetime constructed from a contact manifold with a degenerate metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional spacetime using a three-dimensional contact manifold equipped with a degenerate metric. The degenerate metric is set to be compatible with the contact structure. The compatibility condition is defined in this paper. Our construction yields a Ricci tensor of a particularly simple form, which leads to a solution of the Einstein equation with a null dust and cosmic strings. The solution includes two arbitrary functions: the energy density of the null dust and the number density of the cosmic strings. When there exist the cosmic strings, the spacetime is of Petrov type D. Otherwise, the spacetime is conformally flat. For some simple matter densities, we examine the Einstein equation in detail.</description>

      <title>Energy change and Landauer's principle in the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a general description of the system evolution under the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory up to the second order perturbation, which is also referred to as the simplified model of light-matter interaction. The results are classified into rotating and counter-rotating wave terms, the former corresponding to stimulated absorption and emission, and the latter to Unruh and inverse Unruh effects. We obtain not only the reduced density matrix of the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the environment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field theory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the expectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the temporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the conventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a "temperature", which raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer's principle. We prove that Landauer's principle still holds for any state of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the late-time asymptotic solutions, attractor, and focusing behavior of minimal causal spin hydrodynamics in Bjorken expansion. Using the method of dominant balance, we derive the late-time asymptotic solutions of the evolution equation for spin density and identify the specific conditions necessary for the spin density to exhibit a power-law decay. We then analyze both the late-time and early-time attractors for the decay rate of spin density. Additionally, we report the focusing behavior in spin hydrodynamics, which has not been found in conventional relativistic hydrodynamics in Bjorken expansion. Our findings suggest that spin density can be treated as a conventional hydrodynamic variable at late times under certain conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.02694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The partition function of three dimensional gravity in the quantum regime is dual to the Ising model when the central charge $c=1/2$. Mathematically, we show that the three dimensional gravity can be described by Schramm-Loewner Evolution(SLE) with certain $\kappa$. In fact, SLE depends on the parameter $\kappa$ which controls the diffusion of the Brownian motion. Each value of $c &lt; 1$ corresponds to two values of $\kappa$, which may hint that the three dimensional gravity has two different phases at certain central charge c. Moreover, phase transition is also discussed in AdS and Ising model.</description>

      <title>Constraining Spacetime Dimensions in Quantum Gravity by Scale Invariance and Electric-Magnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a low energy effective theory of $p$-branes in a $D$-dimensional spacetime, and impose two conditions: 1) the theory is scale invariant, and 2) the electric-magnetic dual $(D-p-4)$-branes exist and they obey the same type of interactions to the $p$-branes. (We also assume other natural conditions such as Lorentz invariance but not string theory, supersymmetry, supergravity and so on.) We then ask what $p$ and $D$ are consistent with these conditions. Using simple dimensional analysis, we find that only two solutions are possible: $(p,D)=(2,11)$ and $(p,D)=(2n-1,4n+2)$, ($n=1,2,3,\cdots$). The first solution corresponds to M-theory, and the second solutions at $n=1$ and $n=2$ correspond to self-dual strings in little string theory and D3-branes in type IIB superstring theory, respectively, while the second solutions for $n \ge 3$ are unknown but would be higher spin theories. Thus, quantum gravity (massless spin two theory) satisfying our two conditions would only be superstring theories, and the conditions would be strong enough to characterize superstring theories in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Emission of Charges from Near-Extremal Nariai Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using both the in-out formalism and the monodromy method, we study the emission of charges from near-extremal charged Nariai black holes with the black hole and cosmological horizons close to each other, whose near-horizon geometry is $\mathrm{dS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$. The emission becomes catastrophic for a charge with energy greater than its chemical potential, whose leading exponential factor increases inversely proportional to the separation of two horizons. This implies that near-extremal Nariai black holes with large charges quickly evaporate dominantly through the charge emission and evolve to black holes with a naked singularity, in contrast to near-extremal RN-dS black holes that have the Breitenlohner-Friedman bound below which they become stable against Hawking radiation and Schwinger effect of charge emission. The near-extremal Nariai black holes with small charges, which are close to near-extremal Schwarzschild-dS black holes, emit dominantly charge-neutral particles and evolve to black holes with increasing charge to mass ratio. We illuminate the origin of the catastrophic emission in the phase-integral formulation and monodromy method by comparing near-extremal charged Nariai black holes with near-extremal RN-dS black holes.</description>

      <title>A stabilizer code model with non-invertible symmetries: Strange fractons, confinement, and non-commutative and non-Abelian fusion rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a stabilizer code model with a qutrit at every edge on a square lattice and with non-invertible plaquette operators. The degeneracy of the ground state is topological as in the toric code, and it also has the usual deconfined excitations consisting of pairs of electric and magnetic charges. However, there are novel types of confined fractonic excitations composed of a cluster of adjacent faces with vanishing flux. They manifest confinement, and even larger configurations of these fractons are fully immobile although they acquire emergent internal degrees of freedom. Deconfined excitations change their nature in presence of these fractonic defects. As for instance, fractonic defects can absorb magnetic charges making magnetic monopoles exist while electric charges acquire restricted mobility. Furthermore, some generalized symmetries can annihilate any ground state and also the full sector of fully mobile excitations. All these properties can be captured via a novel type of \textit{non-commutative} and \textit{non-Abelian} fusion category in which the product is associative but does not commute, and can be expressed as a sum of (operator) equivalence classes. Generalized non-invertible symmetries give rise to the feature that the fusion products form a non-unital category without a proper identity. We show that a variant of this model features a deconfined fracton liquid phase and a phase where the dual (magnetic) strings have condensed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15897v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of "semi-classical" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor "localized" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another "boundary structure" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the D3-D7 model and use the spectral function of a probe fermion on D7 to analyze the first order phase transition from the black-hole embedding phase to another black-hole embedding phase in the presence of the finite density and temperature. From the fermionic spectral functions, we study the temperature dependence of the decay rate, and we observe various phenomena that support the first order phase transition including jump in it at the critical temperature that corresponds to the first order phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analytical properties and integrable structures of the meson spectrum in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$. We show that the integral equation that determines the masses of the mesons, often called the 't Hooft equation, is equivalent to finding solutions to a TQ-Baxter equation. Using the Baxter equation, we extract systematic expansions of the energy levels as well as analytic asymptotic expressions for wavefunctions. Our analysis extends previous results for a special quark mass by Fateev et al. to arbitrary quark masses. This reformulation, together with its relation to an inhomogeneous Fredholm equation, is particularly suited for analytical treatments and makes accessible the analytic structure of the spectrum in the complex plane of the quark masses. We also comment on applications of our techniques to non-perturbative topological string partition functions.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between dissipative processes of open quantum systems and the non-Hermitian quantum field theory of relativistic fermionic systems. By examining the influence of dissipative effects on Dirac fermions via Lindblad formalism, we elucidate the effects of the coupling of relativistic Dirac particles with the environment. Employing rigorous theoretical analysis, we explore the impact of dissipative interactions and find the Lyapunov equation of the relativistic dissipation-driven fermionic system. By use of a thermal ansatz, one finds the solution to the Lyapunov equations in terms of a stationary Wigner distribution. Our results describe a non-hermitian fermionic system and provide valuable insights into dissipative quantum phenomena' fundamental mechanisms in relativistic fermionic systems, advancing our understanding of their behavior in non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Infrared finite scattering theory: Scattering states and representations of the BMS group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with any massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an "out" state with memory which gives rise to infrared divergences in the standard $S$-matrix. To obtain an infrared-finite scattering theory, one must suitably include states with memory. However, except in the case of QED with massive charged particles, asymptotic states with memory that have finite energy and angular momentum have not been constructed for more general theories (e.g. massless QED, Yang-Mills and quantum gravity). To this end, we construct direct-integral representations over the "Lorentz orbit" of a given memory and classify all "orbit space representations" that have well-defined energy and angular momentum. We thereby provide an explicit construction of a large supply of physical states with memory as well as the explicit action of the BMS charges all states. The construction of such states is a key step toward the formulation of an infrared-finite scattering theory. While we primarily focus on the quantum gravitational case, we outline how the methods presented in this paper can be applied to obtain representations of the Poincar\'e group with memory for more general quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: We consider a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models. We demonstrate that such a realization involves $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals, one of them providing a coupling to the external field. We also construct Ward identities in the corresponding two $\beta$-ensemble model, which requires a set of identities for partition function of the one $\beta$-ensemble in the external field, and a set of identities for the $\beta$-deformed Itzykson-Zuber integral. These both sets of identities are formulated in terms of the Dunkl operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an arbitrary deformation of the Gaussian matrix model parameterized by Miwa variables $z_a$. One can look at it as a mixture of the Gaussian and logarithmic (Selberg) potentials, which are both superintegrable. The mixture is not, still one can find an explicit expression for an arbitrary Schur average as a linear transform of a {\it finite degree} polynomial made from the values of skew Schur functions at the Gaussian locus $p_k=\delta_{k,2}$. This linear operation includes multiplication with an exponential $ e^{z_a^2/2}$ and a kind of Borel transform of the resulting product, which we call multiple and enhanced. The existence of such remarkable formulas appears intimately related to the theory of auxiliary $K$-polynomials, which appeared in {\it bilinear} superintegrable correlators at the Gaussian point (strict superintegrability). We also consider in the very detail the generating function of correlators $&lt;(\Tr X)^k&gt;$ in this model, and discuss its integrable determinant representation. At last, we describe deformation of all results to the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

Abstract: We provide a step-by-step method to construct skyrmions from instanton ADHM data, including when the exact ADHM data is unknown. The configurations look like clusters of smaller skyrmions, and can be used to build manifolds of skyrmions with or without symmetries. Nuclei are described by quantum states on these manifolds. We describe the construction and quantization procedure generally, then apply the methods in detail to the 8-skyrmion which describes the Beryllium-8 nucleus.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that develops the mathematical framework necessary for studying field theories on ``T-Minkowski'' noncommutative spacetimes. These spacetimes constitute a class of noncommutative geometries, introduced in Part I, that are each invariant under distinct quantum group deformations of the Poincar\'e group. All these noncommutative geometries possess certain physically desirable characteristics, which allow me to develop all the tools of differential geometry and functional analysis, that are necessary in order to build consistent and T-Poincar\'e invariant noncommutative classical field theories.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we performed a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models involving $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals. The realization was derived and studied by using Ward identities, which do not allow one to fix integration contours, these latter were chosen to be real axis for one $\beta$-ensemble and imaginary axis for the other one basing on some particular checks. Here, we evaluate the $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly using a conjecture by I.G. Macdonald, and explain that another choice of integration contours is also possible.</description>

Abstract: It has been argued that the rate at which the interior of an AdS black hole evolves is dual to the rate of evolution of the (quantum state of the) strongly coupled matter on the boundary which, according to holography, is dual to the black hole. However, we have shown elsewhere that it seems to be possible, by adjusting the specific angular momentum of an AdS$_5$-Kerr black hole, to reduce this rate to (effectively) zero. We argue that this is unphysical, and that it is prevented by the intervention of a superradiant instability, which causes the black hole to shed angular momentum when the angular velocity exceeds a certain critical value. The precise way in which this works has recently been explained by the ``grey galaxy'' model of the end state, in which the angular momentum is transferred to a ``galactic disc.'' Thus, the black hole itself cannot sustain a specific angular momentum beyond a critical value: there is an effective upper bound. The holographic interpretation is that, beyond a certain limiting specific angular momentum, strongly coupled matter (corresponding to the black hole) will spontaneously shed angular momentum to some other, confined, form of matter (corresponding to the disc). This idea is supported by recent numerical work on ultra-vortical plasmas. Such an upper bound on specific angular momentum would prevent arbitrarily small rates of quantum state evolution on the boundary. We give a tentative discussion of the relevant observational data in the case of the vortical Quark-Gluon Plasma, and suggest a way in which such an upper bound might appear in future observations.</description>

Abstract: We construct solutions in the form of $AdS_2\times\Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ denotes a spindle geometry, within a particular 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity with vector multiplets and a charged hypermultiplet stemming from a consistent truncation of 6d matter coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity on a Riemann surface. We also compute the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the presumed asymptotically $AdS_4$ black hole solutions, providing a dual prediction for the spindle index of 3d superconformal field theories falling under the class $\mathcal{F}$. Notably, the gravitational block description of the solutions accurately replicates the entropy and the values of scalar fields at the two orbifold points of the spindle, validating our findings.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions for 4-D Dyonic AdS Black Holes</title>

Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of four dimensional charged dyonic AdS black holes. By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be extended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical potential $\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$, electric potential vs. charge $(\tilde{\Phi},\tilde{Q})$, and field theory pressure vs. volume $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and taken a dyonic system. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we examined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{\Phi}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined phase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\mu$, we discover a zeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the fixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles exhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state dual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy of Non-Supersymmetric $\mathbf{\tilde{S}}$ Heterotic String Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the free fermionic formulation of the heterotic-string in four dimensions to study the vacuum structure and energy of non-supersymmetric tachyon free models that correspond to compactifications of tachyonic vacua of the ten dimensional heterotic-string. We explore the class of heterotic $SO(10)$ non-supersymmetric models constructed from the $\tilde{S}$-model in the Free Fermionic Formalism, and investigate the dependence of the potential on the geometric moduli. This paper will explore a sample of $ 10^{9}$ string vacua to find the frequency of viable models, classifying these vacua by the following fertility criteria: tachyon presence; number of spinorial $\boldsymbol{16/\overline{16}}$ representations; vectorial $\boldsymbol{10}$ states; Top Quark Mass Coupling compatibility. Of these we find those that mimic supersymmetric models with equal number of bosons and fermions at the massless level - $a_{00} = 0$. Tachyon free models occur with a frequency of $5.309\times10^{-3}$. Furthermore, models that fulfil the rest of the phenomenological fertility conditions and the additional condition on $a_{00}$ occur with probability $4.0 \times 10^{-9}$ We analyse the partition functions and study the moduli dependence of such models, finding that almost all fertile models have finite, positive potential at the Free Fermionic Point, with $2$ out of $84$ of the fertile cores having negative, finite potential. We demonstratate that the Free Fermionic Point is not necessarily a minimum in the potential. This work provides further evidence that supersymmetry may not be a necessary ingredient of phenomenological models, recreating many of the desirable features of such models without employing supersymmetry.</description>

Abstract: We have constructed conserved $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supercurrents for an arbitrary integer spin through the unconstrained superfield formulation of $4D,\, \mathcal{N}=2$ massless higher-spin theories in the harmonic superspace. The obtained supercurrents are gauge-invariant and determine consistent cubic interactions in the \textit{gauge superfield} $\times$ \textit{supercurrent} form for massless spin $\mathbf{s_1}$ and two massless spin $\mathbf{s_2}$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ supermultiplets. Such interactions and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents exist only for $\mathbf{s_1}\geq 2 \mathbf{s_2}$. These supercurrents are the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric extension of Berends-Burgers-van Dam higher-spin currents and generalize the linearized Bel-Robinson tensor. The relevant $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents can be considered as the descendants of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ primary supercurrent, which has a simple universal structure. An important feature of our outcomes is that, ultimately, all $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents are built from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield strengths, which are constructed from the unconstrained analytical higher-spin prepotentials.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of a natural generalisation of the classical Bochner-Krall problem asking which linear ordinary differential operators possess sequences of eigenpolynomials satisfying linear recurrence relations of finite length; the classical case corresponds to the 3-term recurrence relations with real coefficients subject to some extra restrictions. We formulate a general conjecture and prove it in the first non-trivial case of operators of order 3.</description>

      <title>Wide-angle effects in the galaxy bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) leave unique signatures in the bispectrum of the large-scale structure. With upcoming galaxy surveys set to improve PNG constraints by at least one order of magnitude, it is important to account for any potential contamination. In our work we show how to include wide-angle effects into the 3-dimensional observed galaxy bispectrum. We compute the leading wide-angle corrections to the monopole, finding that they could mimic local PNG with an amplitude of $f_{\rm NL} = \mathcal{O}\left( 0.1 \right)$. We also compute the dipole induced by wide-angle effects, whose amplitude is a few-percent of the flat-sky monopole. We estimate that wide-angle effects in the monopole can be safely neglected for survey volumes of the order of $8~\mathrm{Gpc}^3 h^{-3}$, while the dipole can start being detected from surveys probing volumes larger than $50~\mathrm{Gpc}^3 h^{-3}$. Our formalism can be readily adapted to realistic survey geometries and to include relativistic effects, which may become relevant at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>The Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes via conformal transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this second part of our two-series on extracting the Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes, we focus into spacetimes that are conformal transformations of static spacetimes. Our previous investigation builds upon the Unruh-Hawking analogy, which relates the spacetime of a uniformly accelerating observer to the near-horizon region of a black hole, to obtain the Hawking temperature. However, in this work, we explicitly compute the Bogoliubov coefficients associated with incoming and outgoing modes, which not only yields the temperature but also thermal spectrum of particles emitted by a black hole. For illustration, we take the simplest nontrivial example of the linear Vaidya spacetime, which is conformal to the static metric and using this property, we analytically solve the massless scalar field in its background. This allows the explicit computations of the Bogoliubov coefficients to study the particle production in this spacetime. We also derive an expression for the total mass of such dynamical spacetimes using the conformal Killing vector. We then perform differential variations of the mass formula to determine whether the laws of dynamical black hole mechanics correspond to the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a model comprising $N$ flavors of K\"ahler Dirac fermion propagating on a triangulated two dimensional disk which is constrained to have a negative average bulk curvature. Dirichlet boundary conditions are chosen for the fermions. Quantum fluctuations of the geometry are included by summing over all possible triangulations consistent with these constraints. We show in the limit $N\to \infty$ that the partition function is dominated by a regular triangulation of two dimensional hyperbolic space. We use strong coupling expansions and Monte Carlo simulation to show that in this limit boundary correlators of the fermions have a power law dependence on boundary separation as one expects from holography. However we argue that this behavior breaks down for any finite number of massive fields in the thermodynamic limit and quantum fluctuations of the bulk geometry drive the theory into a non-holographic phase. In contrast, for massless fermions we find evidence that the boundary is conformal even for finite $N$. This is consistent with theoretical results in quantum Liouville theory.</description>

      <title>Correlated scalar perturbations and gravitational waves from axion inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalar and tensor fluctuations generated during inflation can be correlated, if arising from the same underlying mechanism. In this paper we investigate such correlation in the model of axion inflation, where the rolling inflaton produces quanta of a $U(1)$ gauge field which, in turn, source scalar and tensor fluctuations. We compute the primordial correlator of the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, with the gravitational energy density, $\Omega_{GW}$, at frequencies probed by gravitational wave detectors. This two-point function receives two contributions: one arising from the correlation of gravitational waves with the scalar perturbations generated by the standard mechanism of amplification of vacuum fluctuations, and the other coming from the correlation of gravitational waves with the scalar perturbations sourced by the gauge field. Our analysis shows that the former effect is generally dominant. For typical values of the parameters, the correlator, normalized by the amplitude of $\zeta$ and by the fractional energy in gravitational waves at interferometer frequencies, turns out to be of the order of $ 10^{-4}\div 10^{-2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions play a pivotal role in hadron collider phenomenology. They are non-perturbative quantities extracted from fits to available data, and their scale dependence is dictated by the DGLAP evolution equations. In this article, we discuss machine-assisted strategies to efficiently compute PDFs directly incorporating the scale evolution without the need of separately solving DGLAP equations. Analytical approximations to the PDFs as a function of $x$ and $Q^2$, including up to next-to-leading order effects in Quantum Chromodynamics, are obtained. The methodology is tested by reproducing the $\texttt{HERAPDF2.0}$ set and implementing the analytical expressions in benchmarking codes. It is found that the computational cost is reduced while the precision of the simulations stays well under control.</description>

Abstract: We use the higher-order tensor renormalization group method to study the two-dimensional generalized XY model that admits integer and half-integer vortices. This model is the deformation of the classical XY model and has a rich phase structure consisting of nematic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases and three transition lines belonging to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Ising class. We explore the model for a wide range of temperatures, $T$, and the deformation parameter, $\Delta$, and compute specific heat along with integer and half-integer magnetic susceptibility, finding both BKT-like and Ising-like transitions and the region where they meet.</description>

Abstract: From the onset of the subject, granular media have been defying the toolkit of statistical mechanics thus preventing from understanding their thermodynamical and rheological properties and making them one of the key remaining mysteries in science. In the present work, we offer a resolution to this problem in the case of static granular media by considering a collective behavior of 2D identical balls forming a granular pile in the gravity field, which allows us to develop its thermodynamics and rheology from the first principles. Besides the uncertainty due to rough substrate on which the pile is built, we uncover another one due to ambiguities occurring in the positions of some interior balls. Both are responsible for the thermodynamic description of the granular pile, which proves to be anything but ordinary. In particular, we show that a pile is characterized by three temperatures: one is infinite, the other is negative, and the third is of higher-order. Also, considering the fields of ball displacements $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and the normal force deviations $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$ from the ideal isosceles triangular structure of a regular pile reveals the hyperbolic nature of the $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-field and ability of the $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$-field to change the characteristic type from hyperbolic to elliptic. The latter property not only explains the origin of force chains and provides an adequate description of the rheology of static granular media, but turned out to be instrumental for understanding of granular media thermodynamics. Our model should provide a basis for further grasping of granular media properties, in general.</description>

Abstract: We propose a very simple toy model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-supersymmetric quantum system and show, via Klein's construction, how to understand the system as being an $N=2$ supersymmetric system with an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading. That is, the commutation/anticommutation rules are defined via the standard boson/fermion rules, but the system still has an underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading that needs to be taken into account.</description>
