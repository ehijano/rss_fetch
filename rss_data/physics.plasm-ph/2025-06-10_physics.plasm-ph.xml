      <title>Self-seeded photon acceleration by electron beam-driven transition radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon acceleration (PA) driven by ultra-relativistic electron beams offers a promising approach to generating high-power, high-frequency coherent radiation sources. While current methods typically rely on external optical laser pulses injected into beam-driven plasma wakefields, they face significant challenges in synchronization and alignment between electron accelerators and laser systems. We propose utilizing transition radiation (TR) generated by the drive electron bunch transversing the vacuum-gas interface as the seed photons of PA. Using a 1 GeV electron bunch, we demonstrate acceleration of TR from 4.4 {\mu}m to 184 nm in 1.6 mm of two-stage uniform plasma, achieving more than a 20-fold frequency boost. Further frequency increases can be achieved with optimized setups. This scheme addresses the synchronization and alignment issues present in previous approaches, providing a practical path toward beam-driven photon acceleration.</description>

      <title>An Extended-MHD Model for Handling Low-density Plasmas with Tabular Material Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extended-MHD model, interfaced with tabular equation-of-state and conductivity models, has been developed in PERSEUS (Physics as an Extended-MHD Relaxation System with an Efficient Upwind Scheme) for simulating a plasma-vacuum interface under experimentally-relevant conditions for a pulsed-power system, and with minimal sensitivity to parameters characterizing the numerical vacuum. For several test problems, we demonstrate convergence of this model for sufficiently low density floors and with respect to certain vacuum parameters. This capability is crucial for predictively modeling the coupling of energy and current onto a target in a pulsed-power system.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Eulerian Vlasov-Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck Algorithm for Thermonuclear Burning Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate treatment of energetic fusion byproducts in laboratory plasmas often requires a kinetic description, owing to their large birth kinetic energy and long mean-free-paths compared with the characteristic system scale lengths. For example, alpha particles produced by deuterium--tritium fusion reactions are born at high energies (\SI{3.5}{MeV}) and predominantly slow down through interactions with electrons traveling at comparable speeds. As an alpha particle slows, its distribution collapses near the background ion-thermal speed, forming a sharp structure in velocity space. Such sharp features pose numerical challenges in grid-based Eulerian methods: capturing the full alpha-particle energies demands a large velocity domain, while resolving the near-thermal region requires a sufficiently fine mesh. Inspired by the work of Peigney et al.[J. Comput. Phys. 278 (2014)], we present a two-grid approach that splits the alpha-particle distribution into energetic (suprathermal) and ash (thermal) components. A Gaussian-based sink term transfers particles from the energetic population to the ash population as they slow to the thermal regime, and a conservative projection scheme ensures that mass, momentum, and energy of the alpha and ash interactions are preserved. Unlike the formulation of Peigney, our method does not require a strict asymptotic separation of velocity scales, which can, in principle, be arbitrary. We demonstrate the robustness of this approach on challenging multiscale problems, including a surrogate for an igniting inertial confinement fusion capsule.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of stability of low-current needle-to-plane negative corona discharges in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative DC corona discharges are known for their self-pulsing regime: the Trichel pulses. In some works, pulsed regimes, stochastic or periodic, have been observed immediately upon the inception of the discharge, while in other works the discharge was found to be ignited in a stedy-state (pulseless) mode, with the Trichel pulses developing at higher voltages. Recent theoretical and modelling work showed that the stationary negative corona between concentric cylinders in atmospheric-pressure air is stable immediately after the ignition. The pulseless mode was found also in the modelling of the needle-to-plane geometry, however in a quite narrow voltage range. This work studies conditions for a pulseless negative corona discharge in a needle-to-plane geometry to occur over a wide range of voltages, which will facilitate its unambiguous observation in the experiment. After the negative corona loses stability, the current evolution shows, after a small region of quasi-harmonic oscillations, pulses. These can be of small amplitude or regular Trichel pulses, which develop via standing-wave or ionization-wave mechanisms. Modelling results agree with available experimental data, both for the current-voltage characteristics and the stability limit of the pulseless negative corona discharge. An insight is given into stochastic Trichel pulses, which have been observed in experiments under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>An analytical optimization of plasma density profiles for downramp injection in laser wake-field acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and detail a multi-step analytical procedure, based on an improved fully relativistic plane model for Laser Wake Field Acceleration, to tailor the initial density of a cold diluted plasma to the laser pulse profile, so as to control and optimize the partial wave-breaking of the plasma wave and maximize the acceleration of small bunches of electrons self-injected by the first wave-breaking at the density down-ramp, at least in the first stages of their acceleration phase. We find an excellent agreement with the results of Particle In Cell simulations obtained with the same input data.</description>

      <title>Collimated Hard X-Rays from Hybrid Laser and Plasma Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a synergistic enhancement of betatron radiation based on the hybrid laser and plasma wakefield acceleration scheme. Quasi-phase-stable acceleration in an up-ramp plasma density first generates GeV-energy electron beams that act as a drive beam for PWFA, which then further accelerates the witness beam to GeV energies, enhancing both photon energy and flux. A full width at half maximum divergence $(6.1 \pm 1.9)\times(5.8\pm 1.6) $ mrad$^2$ of betatron radiation, a critical energy of $71 \pm 8$ keV, and an average flux of more than $10^{14}$ photons per steradian above 5 keV were all experimentally obtained thanks to this scheme, which was an order of magnitude higher than the previous reports. Quasi-three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations were used to model the acceleration and radiation of the electrons in our experimental conditions, establishing a new paradigm for compact collimated hard X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Enhanced plasma heating via interaction with high-contrast laser and cone-shaped target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated plasma heating enhancement using a high-intensity, high-contrast laser and a cone-attached target. Fast electron spectra and X-ray emission were measured with an electron spectrometer and a Bragg crystal spectrometer. The results were analyzed using PrismSPECT simulations with a two-component electron distribution model and empirical scaling laws. X-ray pinhole images showed that the cone effectively focused multi-spot laser light near its tip, enhancing local emission. While high-contrast laser irradiation reduced the fast electron slope temperature for flat targets, the use of a cone increased it by over threefold, corresponding to a fourfold rise in laser intensity. X-ray spectral analysis indicated an electron temperature of ~9~keV for the cone case, 17.5 times higher than that with a low-contrast laser. These findings demonstrate that combining high-contrast laser irradiation with cone-target geometry significantly improves laser energy coupling and plasma heating efficiency.</description>

      <title>Some features in 4-level generation in LIPLs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that in Laser-Induced Plasma Lasers (LIPL), the collisionally assisted transitions that lead to the inversion population on an upper-generation level E&lt;sub&gt;up&lt;/sub&gt; may be partly forbidden. The spin-orbit coupling may increase the oscillator strength of such transitions. It also demonstrates that collisions between electrons and excited atoms can strongly increase the atoms' energy, creating a population inversion at the E&lt;sub&gt;up&lt;/sub&gt; level, which may lie about 1 eV above the pumped level E&lt;sub&gt;pump&lt;/sub&gt;. Examples of oscillator strengths and collisional transition rate estimates are provided using linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in the Casida formalism.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation Exchange between Nanoparticles Heated by Arc Discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heating of particles by plasma radiation plays a critical role in space science involving dusty plasma as well as in industrial processes such as plasma vapor deposition, microchip production, etching and plasma fusion. Numerical modeling of radiation heat transfer from plasma to nano-scale particles includes exchange of scattered thermal radiation between particles-an effect that was neglected in prior studies in which temperature of particles was estimated. Thermal modeling of gas loaded with nanoparticles differs from a typical multiphase flow, where particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas. In contrast, the temperature of nanoparticles heated by radiation is significantly higher than the local gas temperature. The nanoparticles volume heating by radiation is markedly different from conventional surface heating experience by macroscale particles. The larger particles are heated to higher temperatures than smaller ones. The study includes numerical modeling of thermal radiation scattered by particles in the Rayleigh regime in where particles radii are much smaller compared to the radiation wavelength and the distance between particles is larger than the dominant radiation wavelength. The study investigates the effects of reduction in convection heat flux by reducing the gas pressure and using alternating noble gases. Additionally, it investigates the role of enhancement of radiation heat flux from the arc. The computational results show that the re-radiation by larger, heated nanoparticles is important to obtain the accurate temperature of particles. This inter-particle thermal interaction leads to higher temperatures in smaller particles than models assuming thermally isolated particles would predict.</description>

      <title>Density jump as a function of the field for parallel relativistic collisionless shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are frequently analyzed using the magnetohydrodynamic formalism (MHD), even though the required collisionality hypothesis is not fulfilled. In a previous work \citep{BretJPP2018}, we presented a model of collisionless shock displaying an important departure from the expected MHD behavior, in the case of a strong flow aligned magnetic field. This model was non-relativistic. Here, it is extended to the relativistic regime, considering zero upstream pressure and upstream Lorentz factor $\gg 1$. The result agrees satisfactorily with Particle-in-Cell simulations and shows a similar, and important, departure from the MHD prediction. In the strong field regime, the density jump $r$, seen in the downstream frame, behaves like $r \sim 2 + 1/\gamma_{\mathrm{up}}$ while MHD predicts 4 ($\gamma_{\mathrm{up}}$ is the Lorentz factor of the upstream measured in the downstream frame). Only pair plasmas are considered.</description>

      <title>Energy partition in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a simple and straightforward method to derive the energy partition in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence that was first studied by Lee and then more rigorously by Chandrasekhar. By investigating the energy equation we find that the turbulent viscous and ohmic dissipations are comparable to each other. Under the condition that turbulent viscosity and turbulent magnetic diffusivity are comparable, we deduce that the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies depends on the ratio of the turbulent magnetic lengthscale to turbulent velocity lengthscale of the largest eddies. When the two largest lengthscales are comparable, the two energies are in equipartition.</description>

      <title>A unified fluid model for nonthermal plasmas and reacting flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a unified fluid modeling framework for reacting flows coupled with nonthermal plasmas (NTPs). Building upon the gas-plasma kinetics solver, ChemPlasKin, and the CFD library, OpenFOAM, the integrated solver, reactPlasFOAM, allows simulation of fully coupled plasma-combustion systems with versatility and high performance. By simplifying the governing equations according to the dominant physical phenomena at each stage, the solver seamlessly switches between four operating modes: streamer, spark, reacting flow, and ionic wind, using coherent data structures. Unlike conventional streamer solvers that rely on pre-tabulated or fitted electron transport properties and reaction rates as functions of the reduced electric field or electron temperature, our approach solves the electron Boltzmann equation (EBE) on the fly to update the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at the cell level. This enables a high-fidelity representation of evolving plasma chemistry and dynamics by capturing temporal and spatial variations in mixture composition and temperature. To improve computational efficiency for this multiscale, multiphysics system, we employ adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in the plasma channel, dynamic load balancing for parallelization, and time-step subcycling for fast and slow transport processes. The solver is first verified against six established plasma codes for positive-streamer simulations and benchmarked against Cantera for a freely propagating hydrogen flame, then applied to three cases: (1) spark discharge in airflow; (2) streamer propagation in a premixed flame; and (3) flame dynamics under non-breakdown electric fields. These applications validate the model's ability to predict NTP properties such as fast heating and radical production and demonstrate its potential to reveal two-way coupling between plasma and combustion.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Mapping: Revolutionizing Predictive Models for Divertor Plasma Detachment Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of boundary plasma, characterized by multi-scale and multi-physics challenges, has historically restricted high-fidelity simulations to scientific research due to their intensive computational demands. Consequently, routine applications such as discharge control and scenario development have relied on faster, but less accurate empirical methods. This work introduces DivControlNN, a novel machine-learning-based surrogate model designed to address these limitations by enabling quasi-real-time predictions (i.e., $\sim0.2$ ms) of boundary and divertor plasma behavior. Trained on over 70,000 2D UEDGE simulations from KSTAR tokamak equilibria, DivControlNN employs latent space mapping to efficiently represent complex divertor plasma states, achieving a computational speed-up of over $10^8$ compared to traditional simulations while maintaining a relative error below 20% for key plasma property predictions. During the 2024 KSTAR experimental campaign, a prototype detachment control system powered by DivControlNN successfully demonstrated detachment control on its first attempt, even for a new tungsten divertor configuration and without any fine-tuning. These results highlight the transformative potential of DivControlNN in overcoming diagnostic challenges in future fusion reactors by providing fast, robust, and reliable predictions for advanced integrated control systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical asymptotics of near-axis expansions of quasisymmetric magnetohydrostatic equilibria with anisotropic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) is a property of special magnetic configurations, where the magnetic field strength, but not necessarily the full vector field, has a direction of symmetry. QS leads to reduced neoclassical transport and thus can be a desirable property in stellarator design. The Garren-Boozer (GB) conundrum has been interpreted to mean that globally quasisymmetric magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equilibria, other than axisymmetric solutions, with isotropic pressure do not exist. When expanded as power series of an effective minor radius, the governing equations become overdetermined at the 3rd order. Despite this, recent optimization efforts have found numerical isotropic-pressure equilibria with nearly exact global QS. To reconcile these two perspectives, Rodriguez and Bhattacharjee (RB) showed that by introducing pressure anisotropy into the problem, one can overcome the GB conundrum. This formally enables the study of equilibria with exact, global QS. Building on RB's work, we present pyAQSC, the first code for solving the near-axis expansion (NAE) of anisotropic-pressure quasisymmetric equilibria to any order. As a demonstration, we present a 6th order, QA near-axis equilibrium with anisotropic pressure, and a convergence analysis. PyAQSC opens the door to the study of higher-order properties of equilibria with exact global QS. Like existing isotropic-pressure NAE codes, PyAQSC can accelerate stellarator optimization as an initial state tool. However, by optimizing for low pressure anisotropy in a space that allows anisotropy, pyAQSC may discover practical QS stellarator designs previously hard to access. We give results comparing the RB method with DESC equilibria with anisotropic pressure.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive energy release event. It plays an important role in accelerating particles to high non-thermal energies. These particles often exhibit energy spectra characterized by a power-law distribution. However, the partitioning of energy between thermal and non-thermal components, and between ions and electrons, remains unclear. This study provides estimates of energy partition based on a statistical analysis of magnetic reconnection events in Earth's magnetotail using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Ions are up to ten times more energetic than electrons but have softer spectra. We found for both ions and electrons that, as the average energy of particles (temperature) increases, their energy spectra become \textit{softer} (steeper) and thus, the fraction of energy carried by the non-thermal components decreases. These results challenge existing theories of particle acceleration through magnetotail reconnection.</description>
