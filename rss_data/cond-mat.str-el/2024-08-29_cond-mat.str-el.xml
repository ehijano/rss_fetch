      <title>Fermi-liquid corrections to the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of topological metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that topological metals lacking time-reversal symmetry have an intrinsic non-quantised component of the anomalous Hall conductivity which is contributed not only by the Berry phase of quasiparticles on the Fermi surface, but also by Fermi-liquid corrections due to the residual interactions among quasiparticles, the Landau f-parameters. These corrections pair up with those that modify the optical mass with respect to the quasiparticle effective one, or the charge compressibility with respect to the quasiparticle density of states. Our result supports recent claims that the correct expressions for topological observables include vertex corrections besides the topological invariants built just upon the Green's functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such corrections are already accounted for by Landau's Fermi liquid theory of topological metals, and have important implications when those metals are on the verge of a doping-driven Mott transition, as we discuss.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, boundary modes, and the necessity of unnecessary criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We link the presence of "unnecessary" quantum critical surfaces within a single gapped phase of matter to the non-trivial topology of families of gapped Hamiltonians that encircle the critical surface. We study a specific set of one-dimensional spin models where each such family forms a one-parameter loop in a two-dimensional phase diagram. Foliating the non-critical region by such loops identifies "radial" and "angular" coordinates in the phase diagram that respectively parametrize different families and different members of a single family. We show that each one-parameter family is a generalized Thouless charge pump, all with the same topological index, and hence the gapped phase undergoes one or more nontrivial boundary phase transitions as we vary the angular coordinate in a loop through members of one family. Tuning the radial coordinate generates loci of boundary critical points that terminate at endpoints of the bulk unnecessary critical line within the gapped phase. We discuss broader implications of our results and possible extensions to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Identifying the phases of Kane-Mele Hubbard Hamiltonian in momentum space: A many-body configuration interaction study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic and conduction properties of Kane-Mele Hubbard model in quasi one-dimensional honeycomb ribbon systems at half-filling by varying the strength of both spin-orbit interaction and on-site Coulomb correlation term. We use the numerical many-body configuration interaction (CI) method to investigate the dispersions of charge and spin gaps along with the momentum resolved spin-density profile over the full Brillouin zone. While the spin sector retains its topological nature at all values of spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard term, we report a new signature of the topological phase transition in the charge sector. This phase transition from a topological band insulating phase to a antiferromagnetically ordered Mott insulating phase is characterized by a shift of the many-body charge gap minima from Brillouin zone boundary to Dirac point. Our results provide a better understanding of the shifting of the gap-closing point in the momentum space which was reported in an earlier mean-field study of the same model and suggests an alternative numerical route to detect topological phase transition in strongly-correlated systems in terms of their momentum space behaviors.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal heat transport in the Kitaev chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport, characterized by its direction-selective nature, holds significant potential for applications in various devices. In this study, we investigate nonreciprocal heat transport in Majorana systems, specifically focusing on the Kitaev chiral spin liquid under external magnetic fields. Our theoretical examination focuses on effects of open boundaries in which the Majorana edge modes exist, and the inversion symmetry is broken, which leads to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Through perturbation theory, we demonstrate that DMI induces asymmetric hopping, resulting in the asymmetry of the Majorana band. The results of nonreciprocal heat currents are presented for various directions of external magnetic fields, and we discuss the relation between the current and the field-directions. The potential exists to manipulate both of the directions and magnitude of the non-dissipative current by varying external magnetic fields and apply to non-dissipative heat transfer devices.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of incoherent-coherent crossover and non-Stoner magnetism in the electronic structure of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals ferromagnets have potential applications as next-generation spintronic devices and provide a platform to explore the fundamental physics behind 2D magnetism. The dual nature (localized and itinerant) of electrons adds further complexity to the understanding of correlated magnetic materials. Here, we present the temperature evolution of electronic structure in 2D van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$, using photoemission spectroscopy in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) plus dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). With the appearance of quasiparticle peak and its evolution in the vicinity of Fermi energy, we unveil empirical evidences of incoherent-coherent crossover at around 125 K. DFT+DMFT results show that the quasiparticle lifetime surpasses thermal energy for temperature below 150 K, confirming incoherent-coherent crossover in the system. No appreciable change in the Fe 2$p$ core level, overall valence band spectra across the magnetic transition, and temperature dependent ferromagnetic DFT+DMFT results, provide substantial evidence for non-stoner magnetism in Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. We elucidate the temperature dependent intimate relation between magnetism and electronic structure in Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. Sommerfeld coefficient of $\sim$ 104 mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ obtained in the low temperature limit from DFT+DMFT calculations resolve the long standing issue of large Sommerfeld coefficient ($\sim$ 110 mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$) obtained from specific heat measurements.</description>

      <title>Emergent scalar-chirality \&amp; colossal transverse-magnetoresponse in strongly correlated nodal-line half-metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay of strong correlation and temperature in nodal-line semimetals can offer novel ways to control spin currents. Here we consider the 3d-5d double-perovskite Ba$_{2}$CoWO$_{6}$, which features mirror-symmetry-protected nodal-lines, strong Co-site interactions, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at W sites. Our first principles and exact diagonalization results reveal a half-metallic ground state with high-spin Co and topologically non-trivial bands. We demonstrate that SOC gaps out nodal points, causes band-inversion and generates anomalous Hall response. A semi-classical Monte Carlo finite-temperature simulation of five-orbital Hubbard model uncovers an emergent Co-spin scalar chirality and colossal positive transverse-magnetoresponse. We predict the temperature and magnetic field scales for the tunability of scalar-chirality and magnetoresponse.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in the Dilute Electron Gas of Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightly-doped rhombohedral multilayer graphene has recently emerged as one of the most promising material platforms for exploring electronic phases driven by strong Coulomb interactions and non-trivial band topology. This review highlights recent advancements in experimental techniques that deepen our understanding of the electronic properties of these systems, especially through the application of weak-field magnetic oscillations for studying phase transitions and Fermiology. Theoretically, we advocate modeling these systems using an electron gas framework, influenced primarily by two major energy scales: the long-range Coulomb potential and band energy. The interplay between these energies drives transitions between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states, while smaller energy scales like spin-orbit coupling and sublattice-valley-dependent interactions at the atomic lattice scale shape the (magnetic anisotropic energy) differences between distinct symmetry-broken states. We provide first-principles estimates of lattice-scale coupling constants for Bernal bilayer graphene under strong displacement field, identifying the on-site inter-valley scattering repulsion, with a strength of $g_{\perp \perp}=269\text{meV nm}^2$ as the most significant short-range interaction. The mean-field phase diagram is analyzed and compared with experimental phase diagrams. New results on spin and valley paramagnons are presented, highlighting enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility at finite wavevectors and predicting valley and spin density-wave instabilities. The interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, particularly under the influence of spin-orbit coupling, is critically assessed. The review concludes with a summary of key findings and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Spin Excitation Continuum in the Exactly Solvable Triangular-Lattice Spin Liquid CeMgAl11O19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetically ordered insulators, elementary quasiparticles manifest as spin waves - collective motions of localized magnetic moments propagating through the lattice - observed via inelastic neutron scattering. In effective spin-1/2 systems where geometric frustrations suppress static magnetic order, spin excitation continua can emerge, either from degenerate classical spin ground states or from entangled quantum spins characterized by emergent gauge fields and deconfined fractionalized excitations. Comparing the spin Hamiltonian with theoretical models can unveil the microscopic origins of these zero-field spin excitation continua. Here, we use neutron scattering to study spin excitations of the two-dimensional (2D) triangular-lattice effective spin-1/2 antiferromagnet CeMgAl11O19. Analyzing the spin waves in the field-polarized ferromagnetic state, we find that the spin Hamiltonian is close to an exactly solvable 2D triangular-lattice XXZ model, where degenerate 120$^\circ$ ordered ground states - umbrella states - develop in the zero temperature limit. We then find that the observed zero-field spin excitation continuum matches the calculated ensemble of spin waves from the umbrella state manifold, and thus conclude that CeMgAl11O19 is the first example of an exactly solvable spin liquid on a triangular lattice where the spin excitation continuum arises from the ground state degeneracy.</description>

      <title>1+1d SPT phases with fusion category symmetry: interface modes and non-abelian Thouless pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with finite non-invertible symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ in 1+1d. In particular, we investigate interfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix product states. After revealing how to extract the $\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant, we identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the interface of two $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation theory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode between different $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the bulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the classification of one-parameter families of $\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on the explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is identified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which is the pump of a local excitation within a $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by generalizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we conjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general gapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for number-conserving bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer models and certain Levin-Wen string-net models, and we also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute in enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles which are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to study the dynamics of open quantum systems with linearly coupled Gaussian baths. Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.</description>

Abstract: We explore theoretically the properties of engineered bimetallic nano-structured superlattices where an array of nano-clusters of a simple (single band) metal are embedded periodically inside another simple metal with a different work function. The exploration is done using a simplified tight-binding model with Coulomb interactions included, as well as density functional theory. Taking arrays of "Ag" clusters of fixed sizes and configurations (when unrelaxed) embedded periodically in an "Au" matrix as an example, we show that a significant enhancement of electron-phonon interactions ensues, implying possibilities for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The enhancement stems from a strong coupling, via Coulomb interactions, between the dipolar charge distribution that forms at the Au-Ag interfaces and the breathing and other modes of vibration of the light Ag atoms caged inside the heavier Au matrix. The interface dipoles form because of the interplay between the mismatch of the local potential seen by the conduction electrons localised in Wannier orbitals at the Ag and Au sites (the Ag sites being slightly repulsive relative to the Au sites) and the (long-range) Coulomb repulsion between electrons occupying these Wannier orbitals. We also discuss the DC transport in such systems.</description>

Abstract: The mutual information method has demonstrated to be very useful for deriving the potential order parameter of a system. Although the method suggests some constraints which help to define this quantity, there is still some freedom in the definition. The method then results inefficient for cases where we have order parameters with a large number of constants in the expansion, which happens when we have many degenerate vacuums. Here we introduce some additional constraints based on the existence of broken symmetries, which help us to reduce the arbitrariness in the definitions of the order parameter in the proposed mutual information method.</description>

Abstract: Quantum correlations are a fundamental property of quantum many-body states. Yet they remain experimentally elusive, hindering certification of genuine quantum behavior, especially in quantum materials. Here we show that the momentum-dependent dynamical susceptibility measured via inelastic neutron scattering enables the systematic reconstruction of a general family of quantum correlation functions, which express the degree of quantum coherence in the fluctuations of two spins at arbitrary mutual distance. Using neutron scattering data on the compound KCuF$_3$ $\unicode{x2014}$ a system of weakly coupled $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chains $\unicode{x2014}$ and of numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo data, we show that quantum correlations possess a radically different spatial structure with respect to conventional correlations. Indeed, they exhibit a new emergent length scale $\unicode{x2014}$ the quantum coherence length $\unicode{x2014}$ which is finite at any finite temperature (including when long-range magnetic order develops). Moreover, we show theoretically that coupled Heisenberg spin chains exhibit a form of quantum monogamy, with a trade-off between quantum correlations along and transverse to the spin chains. These results highlight real-space quantum correlators as an informative, model-independent means of probing the underlying quantum state of real quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding non-Fermi liquids in dimensions higher than one remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern condensed matter physics. These systems, characterized by an abundance of gapless degrees of freedom and the absence of well-defined quasiparticles, defy conventional analytical frameworks. Inspired by recent work [Delacretaz, Du, Mehta, and Son, Physical Review Research, 4, 033131 (2022)], we present a procedure for bosonizing Fermi surfaces that does not rely on the existence of sharp excitation and is thus directly applicable to non-Fermi liquids. Our method involves parameterizing the generalized fermionic distribution function through a bosonic field that describes frequency-dependent local variations of the chemical potential in momentum space. We propose an effective action that produces the collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation as its equation of motion and can be used for any dimension and Fermi surface of interest. Even at the quadratic order, this action reproduces non-trivial results obtainable only through involved analysis with alternative means. By offering an alternative method directly applicable to studying the low-energy physics of Fermi and non-Fermi liquids, our work potentially stands as an important building block in advancing the comprehension of strange metals and associated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Luther-Emery liquid and dominant singlet superconductivity in the hole-doped Haldane spin-1 chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pairing tendencies in the hole-doped Haldane spin-1 chain. To allow for doping, we extend the original spin chain Hamiltonian into a fermionic model involving a two-orbital Hubbard chain at intermediate or strong repulsive interaction strengths $U$, and for degenerate orbitals. At half-filling and large $U$, the ferromagnetic Hund's coupling, $J_\mathrm{H}$, generates effective spin-$1$ moments, with antiferromagnetic correlations between sites. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we study accurately the system's behavior under light hole-doping. For $U=1.6$ in units of the non-interacting bandwidth and for $J_\mathrm{H}/U\gtrsim 0.275$ we find that singlet pairing dominates the long-distance physics, establishing this system as a promising platform for repulsively mediated superconductivity. We provide concrete examples of materials that could realize the physics described here. We also provide evidence that the system approaches a Luther-Emery liquid state at large system sizes, reminiscent of the behavior of doped one-orbital two-leg ladders at weak coupling, which also have superconducting tendencies. The numerically calculated central charge approaches one in the thermodynamic limit, indicating a single gapless mode as is expected for the Luther-Emery state. Exponents characterizing the power-law decays of singlet pair-pair and charge density-density correlations are determined, and found to approximately satisfy the Luther-Emery identity.</description>

      <title>GdAlSi: An antiferromagnetic topological Weyl semimetal with non-relativistic spin splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional electronics based technologies in the past few decades. While on one hand, the discovery of topological phases of matter with protected spin-polarized states has opened up exciting prospects, recent revelation of intriguing non-relativistic spin splitting in collinear antiferromagnetic materials with unique symmetries facilitate a wide possibility of realizing both these features simultaneously. In this work, we report the co-existence of these two intriguing properties within a single material: GdAlSi. It crystallizes in a body-centered tetragonal structure with a non-centrosymmetric space group $I4_{1}md$ ($109$), which is confirmed using detailed structural analysis through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. The magnetization data indicates AFM ordering with an ordering temperature ($T_N$) $\sim$ 32 K. Ab-initio calculations reveal GdAlSi to be a collinear antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal with an unconventional, momentum-dependent spin splitting, also referred to as altermagnet. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on GdAlSi single crystals subsequently confirm the presence of Fermi arcs, a distinctive hallmark of Weyl semimetals. Electric and magnetic multipole analysis provides a deeper understanding of the symmetry-mediated, momentum-dependent spin splitting, which has strictly non-relativistic origin. To the best of our knowledge, such co-existence of unconventional antiferromagnetic order and non-trivial topology is unprecedented and has never been observed before in a single material, rendering GdAlSi a special and promising candidate material. We propose a device harnessing these features, poised to enable practical and efficient topotronic applications.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>

Abstract: Electronic fluids can display exciting dynamical properties. In particular, due to Landau damping, the collective modes spectrum of an electronic system with multipolar interactions is non-hermitian, and can present non-hermitian degeneracies called $\textit{exceptional points}$. In this work, we want to explore the dynamical properties of these degeneracies using laser control. We show that by using a light pulse, we can control the collective mode spectrum and tune a non-hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$ phase transition in which two exceptional points anhilate each other. At this transition, the gap closes with a cubic root signature, what defines a third order exceptional point.</description>

Abstract: We solve a model of electrons with Hubbard-$U$ Coulomb repulsion and a random Yukawa coupling to a two-dimensional bosonic bath, using an extended dynamical mean field theory scheme. Our model exhibits a quantum critical point, at which the repulsive component of the electron interactions strongly enhances the effects of the quantum critical bosonic fluctuations on the electrons, leading to a breakdown of Fermi liquid physics and the formation of a strange metal with `Planckian' ($\mathcal{O}(k_B T/\hbar)$) quasiparticle decay rates at low temperatures $T\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, the eventual Mott transition that occurs as the repulsion is increased seemingly bounds the maximum decay rate in the strange metal. Our results provide insight into low-temperature strange metallicity observed in proximity to a Mott transition, as is observed, for instance, in recent experiments on certain moir\'{e} materials.</description>

      <title>Stacking-Dependent Van Hove Singularity Shifts in Three-Dimensional Charge Density Waves of Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs)</title>

Abstract: Vanadium-based kagome systems AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) have emerged as paradigmatic examples exhibiting unconventional charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity linked to van Hove singularities (VHSs). Despite extensive studies, the three-dimensional (3D) nature of CDW states in these systems remains elusive. This study employs first-principles density functional theory and a tight-binding model to investigate the stacking-dependent electronic structures of 3D CDWs in AV$_3$Sb$_5$, emphasizing the significant role of interlayer coupling in behaviors of the VHSs associated with diverse 3D CDW orders. We develop a minimal 3D tight-binding model and present a detailed analysis of band structures and density of states for various 3D CDW stacking configurations, including those with and without a $\pi$-phase shift stacking of the inverse star of David, as well as alternating stacking of the inverse star of David and the star of David. We find that VHSs exist below the Fermi level even in 3D CDWs without $\pi$-phase shift stackings, and that these VHSs shift downward in the $\pi$-phase shift stacking CDW structure, stabilizing the $2\times2\times2$ $\pi$-shifted inverse star of David distortions in alternating vanadium layers as the ground state 3D CDW order of AV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our work provides the electronic origin of 3D CDW orders, paving the way for a deeper understanding of CDWs and superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structure of a superconducting nickelate probed by the Seebeck coefficient in the disordered limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nickelates are a new family of strongly correlated electron materials with a phase diagram closely resembling that of superconducting cuprates. While analogy with the cuprates is natural, very little is known about the metallic state of the nickelates, making these comparisons difficult. We probe the electronic dispersion of thin-film superconducting 5-layer ($n=5$) and metallic 3-layer ($n=3$) nickelates by measuring the Seebeck coefficient, $S$. We find a temperature-independent and negative $S/T$ for both $n=5$ and $n=3$ nickelates. These results are in stark contrast to the strongly temperature-dependent $S/T$ measured at similar electron filling in the cuprate La$_{1.36}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.24}$CuO$_4$. The electronic structure calculated from density functional theory can reproduce the temperature dependence, sign, and amplitude of $S/T$ in the nickelates using Boltzmann transport theory. This demonstrates that the electronic structure obtained from first-principles calculations provides a reliable description of the Fermiology of superconducting nickelates, and suggests that, despite indications of strong electronic correlations, there are well-defined quasiparticles in the metallic state. Finally, we explain the differences in the Seebeck coefficient between nickelates and cuprates as originating in strong dissimilarities in impurity concentrations. Our study demonstrates that the high elastic scattering limit of the Seebeck coefficient reflects only the underlying band structure of a metal, analogous to the high magnetic field limit of the Hall coefficient. This opens a new avenue for Seebeck measurements to probe the electronic band structures of relatively disordered quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Quantum Error Correction in Intertwined Toric Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new subsystem code in three dimensions that exhibits single-shot error correction in a user-friendly and transparent way. As this code is a subsystem version of coupled toric codes, we call it the intertwined toric code (ITC). Although previous codes share the property of single-shot error correction, the ITC is distinguished by its physically motivated origin, geometrically straightforward logical operators and errors, and a simple phase diagram. The code arises from 3d stabilizer toric codes in a way that emphasizes the physical origin of the single-shot property. In particular, starting with two copies of the 3d toric code, we add check operators that provide for the confinement of pointlike excitations without condensing the loop excitations. Geometrically, the bare and dressed logical operators in the ITC derive from logical operators in the underlying toric codes, creating a clear relationship between errors and measurement outcomes. The syndromes of the ITC resemble the syndromes of the single-shot code by Kubica and Vasmer, allowing us to use their decoding schemes. We also extract the phase diagram corresponding to ITC and show that it contains the phases found in the Kubica-Vasmer code. Finally, we suggest various connections to Walker-Wang models and measurement-based quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in 2+1 dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary numerical evidence for the hypothesis that the Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory discretized on a lattice obeys the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). To do so we study three approximations: (a) a linear plaquette chain in a reduced Hilbert space limiting the electric field basis to $j=0,\frac{1}{2}$ , (b) a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with periodic or closed boundary condition and the same Hilbert space constraint, and (c) a chain of only three plaquettes but such a sufficiently large electric field Hilbert space ($j \leq \frac{7}{2})$ that convergence of all energy eigenvalues in the analyzed energy window is observed. While an unconstrained Hilbert space is required to reach the continuum limit of SU(2) gauge theory, numerical resource constraints do not permit us to realize this requirement for all values of the coupling constant and large lattices. In each of the three studied cases we check first for random matrix theory (RMT) behavior in the eigenenergy spectrum and then analyze the diagonal as well as the off-diagonal matrix elements between energy eigenstates for a few operators. Within current uncertainties all results for (a), (b) and (c) agree with ETH predictions. Furthermore, we find the off-diagonal matrix elements of the electric energy operator exhibit RMT behavior in frequency windows that are small enough in (b) and (c). To unambiguously establish ETH behavior and determine for which class of operators it applies, an extension of our investigations is necessary.</description>

      <title>Critical analysis of multiple reentrant localization in an antiferromagnetic helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario</title>

Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry.</description>

      <title>First-principle quantum Monte-Carlo study of charge carrier mobility in organic molecular semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principle numerical study of charge transport in a realistic two-dimensional tight-binding model of organic molecular semiconductors. We use the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm to simulate the full quantum dynamics of phonons and either a single or multiple charge carriers without any tunable parameters. We introduce a number of algorithmic improvements, including efficient Metropolis updates for phonon fields based on analytic insights, which lead to negligible autocorrelation times and allow to reach sub-permille precisions at small computational cost of $O(1)$ CPU-hour. Our simulations produce charge mobility estimates that are in good agreement with experiment and that also justify the phenomenological Transient Localisation approach.</description>

      <title>Chiral TeraHertz surface plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral engineering of TeraHertz (THz) light fields and the use of the handedness of light in THz light-matter interactions promise many novel opportunities for advanced sensing and control of matter in this frequency range. Unlike previously explored methods, this is achieved here by leveraging the chiral properties of highly confined THz surface plasmon modes. More specifically, we design ultrasmall surface plasmonic-based THz cavities and THz metasurfaces that display significant and adjustable chiral behavior under modest magnetic fields (B&lt;500mT). For such a prototypical example of non-hermitian and dispersive photonic system, we demonstrate the capacity to magnetic field-tune both the poles and zeros of cavity resonances, the two fundamental parameters governing their resonance properties. Alongside the observed handedness-dependent cavity frequencies, this highlights the remarkable ability to engineer chiral and tunable radiative couplings for THz resonators and metasurfaces. The extensive tunability offered by the surface plasmonic approach paves the way for the development of agile and multifunctional THz metasurfaces as well as the realization of ultrastrong chiral light-matter interactions at low energy in matter with potential far-reaching applications for the design of material properties.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusive bound on Fredkin and Motzkin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

      <title>Observation of single-quantum vortex splitting in the Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05902</link>

Abstract: Since their theoretical discovery more than a half-century ago, vortices observed in bulk superconductors have carried a quantized value of magnetic flux determined only by fundamental constants. A recent experiment reported 'unquantized' quantum vortices carrying the same fraction of flux quantum in Ba$_{0.23}$K$_{0.77}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ in a small temperature range below its superconducting critical temperature ($T_C$). Here, we use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (sSQUID) microscopy with improved sensitivity to investigate the genesis of fractional vortices in Ba$_{0.23}$K$_{0.77}$Fe$_2$As$_2$. We report the direct observation of a single-flux quantum vortex splitting into two different fractions with increasing temperature. The flux of the two fractions has opposite dependence on temperature, while the total flux sums up to one flux quantum despite their spatial separation. Overall, our study shows the existence of different fractional vortices and their stability in temperature ranging from 0.1 to 0.99 $T_C$. Besides the implications of this observation for the fundamental question of quantum vorticity, the discovery of these objects paves the way for the new platform for anyon quasiparticles and applications for fractional fluxonics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity emerging along with the strange-metal behavior in UAs2 under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 with Tc = 2 K has attracted enormous attention because it possesses many interesting properties, such as the extremely high upper critical field Hc2(0), chiral superconductivity and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, etc., all these suggest that it may be the long-sought spin-triplet superconductor. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity up to Tc = 4K in one of its siblings, i.e., UAs2 under high pressures. Interestingly, the UAs2 shows metallic behavior with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at about 274 K under ambient pressure. Upon applying pressure, this transition is pushed down to lower temperatures with improved electric conductivity. When the pressure rises to about 20-22 GPa, superconductivity occurs together with the emergence of a linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance, the latter is a hallmark of the strange-metal state. The superconductivity with the highest Tc = 4 K is reached under a pressure of about 26.8 GPa, and it is robust against magnetic field with the upper critical field {\mu}0Hc2(0) ~ 12 T, far beyond the Pauli limit. Higher pressures will suppress the superconductivity and bring back the Fermi liquid behavior, showing a clear signature of quantum criticality. Our results open a new avenue for investigating the unconventional superconductivity concerning the mysterious 5f-band electrons in this uranium-based system.</description>
