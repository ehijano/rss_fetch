      <title>Topological Sequence Analysis of Genomes: Delta Complex approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic topology has been widely applied to point cloud data to capture geometric shapes and topological structures. However, its application to genome sequence analysis remains rare. In this work, we propose topological sequence analysis (TSA) techniques by constructing $\Delta$-complexes and classifying spaces, leading to persistent homology, and persistent path homology on genome sequences. We also develop $\Delta$-complex-based persistent Laplacians to facilitate the topological spectral analysis of genome sequences. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed TSA approaches in phylogenetic analysis using Ebola virus sequences and whole bacterial genomes. The present TSA methods are more efficient than earlier TSA model, k-mer topology, and thus have a potential to be applied to other time-consuming sequential data analyses, such as those in linguistics, literature, music, media, and social contexts.</description>

      <title>Andre-Quillen (co)homology and Equivariant Stable Homotopy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andr\'e and Quillen introduced a (co)homology theory for augmented commutative rings. Strickland initially proposed some issues with the analogue of the abelianization functor in the equivariant setting. These were resolved by Hill who further gave the notion of a genuine derivation and a module of K\"ahler differentials. We build on this endeavor by expanding to incomplete Tambara functors, introducing the cotangent complex and its various properties, and producing an analogue of the fundamental spectral sequence.
  Note: This thesis is reposted with a correction that appears at the end of chapter 3. Namely, we make an additional assumption that a map be a cofibration in order to generate the transitivity long exact sequence. This change influences chapter 4 and when we can generate the fundamental spectral sequence.</description>

      <title>Higher Segal spaces and partial groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $d$-Segal conditions of Dyckerhoff and Kapranov are exactness properties for simplicial objects based on the geometry of cyclic polytopes in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. 2-Segal spaces are also known as decomposition spaces, and most activity has focused on this case. We study the interplay of these conditions with the partial groups of Chermak, a class of symmetric simplicial sets. The $d$-Segal conditions simplify for symmetric simplicial objects, and take a particularly explicit form for partial groups. We show partial groups provide a rich class of $d$-Segal sets for $d &gt; 2$, by undertaking a systematic study of the "degree" of a partial group $X$, namely the smallest $k\geq 1$ such that $X$ is $2k$-Segal. We develop effective tools to explicitly compute the degree based on the discrete geometry of actions of partial groups, which we define and study. Applying these tools involves solving Helly-type problems for abstract closure spaces. We carry out degree computations in concrete settings, including for the punctured Weyl groups introduced here, where we find that the degree is closely related to the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra of the associated semisimple Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Divided difference operators for Hessenberg representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equivariant cohomology ring of a regular semisimple Hessenberg variety in type A is a free module over the equivariant cohomology ring of a point. When equipped with Tymoczko's dot action, it becomes a twisted representation of the symmetric group, and the character of this representation is given by the chromatic quasisymmetric function of an indifference graph. In this note, we use divided difference operators to decompose this representation as a direct sum of sub-representations in a way that categorifies the modular relation between chromatic quasisymmetric functions.</description>

      <title>When does a tree activate the random graph?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ and $G$ be two graphs. A spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ is called weakly $F$-saturated if one can add to $H$ the edges of $G \setminus H$ in some order, so that whenever a new edge is added, a new copy of $F$ is formed. Obtaining lower bounds for the minimum size $\mathrm{wsat}(G,F)$ of such an $H$ is a classical problem in extremal combinatorics. In particular, in the past 40 years, various algebraic tools have been developed to prove lower bounds on the weak saturation number $\mathrm{wsat}(G,F)$. Our paper uncovers a new connection of weak saturation to topology of clique complexes, that allows to prove tight lower bounds in some cases when the algebraic tools are not efficient.
  It is easy to see that the smallest $K_3$-saturating graphs in $K_n$ are trees, thus $\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,K_3)=n-1$. In 2017, Kor\'andi and Sudakov proved that this is also the case in dense random graphs $G\sim G_{n,p}$, $p=\mathrm{const}\in(0,1)$, and posed the question of determining the smallest $p$ for which $G_{n,p}$ contains a $K_3$-saturating tree with high probability. Using the new topological connection, we show that this critical $p$ is of order $n^{-1/3-o(1)}$.
  Inspired by Gromov's local-to-global principle for hyperbolic groups, we further develop our topological approach and determine the critical probability up to a constant factor, for trees with diameter at most $n^{c}$, for some $c&gt;0$.
  The new connection also enables us to improve the best known upper bound on the threshold probability for simple connectivity of the 2-dimensional clique complex of $G_{n,p}$, due to Kahle.</description>

      <title>Modular functors from conformal blocks of rational vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a vertex operator algebra $V$, one may naturally define spaces of conformal blocks following a construction of Frenkel--Ben-Zvi generalized by Damiolini--Gibney--Tarasca. If $V$ is strongly rational, these spaces of conformal blocks form vector bundles over a suitable moduli space of algebraic curves. In this article, we establish, under the same assumptions, the widely expected topological result that the spaces of conformal blocks produce a modular functor, i.e. a modular algebra over an extension of the surface operad. This entails that the category $\mathcal{C}_V$ of admissible $V$-modules inherits from the topology a ribbon Grothendieck--Verdier structure that leads even to the structure of a modular fusion category whose structure comes directly from the spaces of conformal blocks of $V$. As a direct consequence, we prove that the modular functor from conformal blocks extends to a three-dimensional topological field theory and comes with a description in terms of factorization homology.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Frobenius and Verschiebung maps that are fundamental to Witt vectors lift to the reduced K-theory of endomorphisms. In particular, we define Frobenius and Verschiebung maps for the reduced K-theory of twisted endomorphisms of modules over non commutative rings and show they have the expected behavior after applying the iterated trace map</description>

      <title>On Jiang's Bounded Index Property for products of nilmanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, Zhang and Zhao presented the first examples of aspherical manifolds lacking the Bounded Index Property (BIP) for fixed points. This answered a question posed by Jiang in 1998 in the negative. In this paper, we first extend the notion of BIP to that of iterations of selfmaps (BIP$_k$), and then demonstrate BIP$_k$ for certain products $M\times N$ of nilmanifolds. Finally, we give characterizations for the Lefschetz number, the Nielsen number, and the minimal number of fixed points of self-homotopy equivalences of $M\times N$.</description>

      <title>Splitting of abelian varieties in motivic stable homotopy category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the motivic stable homotopy type of abelian varieties. For an abelian variety over a perfect field $k$ with a rational point, it always splits off a top-dimensional cell in motivic stable homotopy category $\text{SH}(k)$. Let $k=\mathbb{R}$, there is a concrete splitting which is determined by the motive of X and the real points $X(\mathbb{R})$ in $\text{SH}(\mathbb{R})_\Lambda$ for some $\mathbb{Z}\subset\Lambda\subset\mathbb{Q}$. We will also discuss this splitting from a viewpoint of the Chow-Witt correspondences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect field and $X$ be a smooth projective surface over $k$ with a rational point, we discuss the condition of splitting off the top cell for the motivic stable homotopy type of $X$. We also study some outlying examples, such as K3 surfaces. When $k$ is an algebraically field with characteristic not equal to 2, we can give an alternative proof of the splitting result of curves and also understand the splittings of Calabi-Yau surfaces via the motivic Hurewicz theorem and decomposition of the Chow-Witt correspondences.</description>

      <title>On stratifications and poset-stratified spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stratified space is a topological space equipped with a \emph{stratification}, which is a decomposition or partition of the topological space satisfying certain extra conditions. More recently, the notion of poset-stratified space, i.e., topological space endowed with a continuous map to a poset with its Alexandrov topology, has been popularized. Both notions of stratified spaces are ubiquitous in mathematics, ranging from investigations of singular structures in algebraic geometry to extensions of the homotopy hypothesis in higher category theory. In this article we study the precise mathematical relation between these different approaches to stratified spaces.</description>
