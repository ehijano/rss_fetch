      <title>Managing O-RAN Networks: xApp Development from Zero to Hero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance proposes an open architecture that disaggregates the RAN and supports executing custom control logic in near-real time from third-party applications, the xApps. Despite O-RAN's efforts, the creation of xApps remains a complex and time-consuming endeavor, aggravated by the fragmented, outdated, or deprecated documentation from the O-RAN Software Community (OSC). These challenges hinder academia and industry from developing and validating solutions and algorithms on O-RAN networks. This tutorial addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive guide for developing xApps to manage the O-RAN ecosystem, from theory to practice. We provide a thorough theoretical foundation of the O-RAN architecture and detail the functionality offered by Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) components. We examine the xApp design and detail its configuration. We explore the xApp lifecycle and demonstrate how to deploy and manage xApps on a Near-RT RIC. We dive deep into the xApps' interfaces and capabilities, accompanied by practical examples. We also provide comprehensive details on how xApps can control the RAN. We discuss debugging strategies and good practices to aid the xApp developers in testing their xApps. Finally, we review the current landscape and open challenges for creating xApps.</description>

      <title>Biased Backpressure Routing Using Link Features and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce the latency of Backpressure (BP) routing in wireless multi-hop networks, we propose to enhance the existing shortest path-biased BP (SP-BP) and sojourn time-based backlog metrics, since they introduce no additional time step-wise signaling overhead to the basic BP. Rather than relying on hop-distance, we introduce a new edge-weighted shortest path bias built on the scheduling duty cycle of wireless links, which can be predicted by a graph convolutional neural network based on the topology and traffic of wireless networks. Additionally, we tackle three long-standing challenges associated with SP-BP: optimal bias scaling, efficient bias maintenance, and integration of delay awareness. Our proposed solutions inherit the throughput optimality of the basic BP, as well as its practical advantages of low complexity and fully distributed implementation. Our approaches rely on common link features and introduces only a one-time constant overhead to previous SP-BP schemes, or a one-time overhead linear in the network size to the basic BP. Numerical experiments show that our solutions can effectively address the major drawbacks of slow startup, random walk, and the last packet problem in basic BP, improving the end-to-end delay of existing low-overhead BP algorithms under various settings of network traffic, interference, and mobility.</description>

      <title>SeqBalance: Congestion-Aware Load Balancing with no Reordering for RoCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is widely used in data center networks because of its high performance. However, due to the characteristics of RDMA's retransmission strategy and the traffic mode of AI training, current load balancing schemes for data center networks are unsuitable for RDMA. In this paper, we propose SeqBalance, a load balancing framework designed for RDMA. SeqBalance implements fine-grained load balancing for RDMA through a reasonable design and does not cause reordering problems. SeqBalance's designs are all based on existing commercial RNICs and commercial programmable switches, so they are compatible with existing data center networks. We have implemented SeqBalance in Mellanox CX-6 RNICs and Tofino switches. The results of hardware testbed experiments and large-scale simulations show that compared with existing load balancing schemes, SeqBalance improves 18.7% and 33.2% on average FCT and 99th percentile FCT.</description>

      <title>Resilience in PON-based data centre architectures with two-tier cascaded AWGRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a two-tier AWGR-based Passive Optical Network (PON) data centre architecture against an AWGR-based PON data centre architecture by considering various scenarios involving link failures to evaluate the resilience of both designs. To optimize traffic routing under different failure scenarios, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed and the power consumption and delay performance is assessed. The results demonstrate that the two-tier AWGR architecture reduced the power consumption and the delay compared to the AWGR-based architecture by up to 10% and 61%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards Enabling 5G-NTN Satellite Communications for Manned and Unmanned Rotary Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite Communications (SatCom) are a backbone of worldwide development. In contrast with the past, when the GEO satellites were the only means for such connectivity, nowadays the multi-orbital connectivity is emerging, especially with the use of satellite constellations. Simultaneously, SatCom enabled the so-called In-Flight Connectivity, while with the advent of 5G-NTN, the development of this market is being accelerated. However, there are still various missing points before such a technology becomes mainstream, especially in the case of Rotary Wing Aircraft (RWA). Indeed, due to their particular characteristics, such as the low altitude flights and the blade interference, there are still open challenges. In this work, an End-to-End (E2E) analysis for the performance of SatCom under 5G-NTN for manned and unmanned RWA is performed. Various scenarios are examined, and related requirements are shown. The effects of blades and other characteristics of the RWA are established, and simulations for these cases are developed. Results along with related discussion are presented, while future directions for development are suggested. This work is part of the ESA ACROSS-AIR project.</description>

      <title>Toward Explainable Reasoning in 6G: A Proof of Concept Study on Radio Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The move toward artificial intelligence (AI)-native sixth-generation (6G) networks has put more emphasis on the importance of explainability and trustworthiness in network management operations, especially for mission-critical use-cases. Such desired trust transcends traditional post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods to using contextual explanations for guiding the learning process in an in-hoc way. This paper proposes a novel graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework named TANGO which relies on a symbolic subsystem. It consists of a Bayesian-graph neural network (GNN) Explainer, whose outputs, in terms of edge/node importance and uncertainty, are periodically translated to a logical GRL reward function. This adjustment is accomplished through defined symbolic reasoning rules within a Reasoner. Considering a real-world testbed proof-of-concept (PoC), a gNodeB (gNB) radio resource allocation problem is formulated, which aims to minimize under- and over-provisioning of physical resource blocks (PRBs) while penalizing decisions emanating from the uncertain and less important edge-nodes relations. Our findings reveal that the proposed in-hoc explainability solution significantly expedites convergence compared to standard GRL baseline and other benchmarks in the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) domain. The experiment evaluates performance in AI, complexity, energy consumption, robustness, network, scalability, and explainability metrics. Specifically, the results show that TANGO achieves a noteworthy accuracy of 96.39% in terms of optimal PRB allocation in inference phase, outperforming the baseline by 1.22x.</description>

      <title>Distributed Scheduling for Throughput Maximization under Deadline Constraint in Wireless Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed scheduling of traffic flows with arbitrary deadlines that arrive at their source nodes and are transmitted to different destination nodes via multiple intermediate nodes in a wireless mesh network. When a flow is successfully delivered to its destination, a reward will be obtained, which is the embodiment of network performance and can be expressed by metrics such as throughput or network utility. The objective is to maximize the aggregate reward of all the deadline-constrained flows, which can be transformed into the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). According to the transformation, a policy gradient-based distributed scheduling (PGDS) method is first proposed, where a primary reward and an auxiliary reward are designed to incentivize each node to independently schedule network resources such as power and subcarriers. The primary reward is generated when flows are successfully delivered to their destinations. The auxiliary reward, designed based on potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) using local information of data transmission, aims to accelerate the convergence speed. Inside this method, a reward feedback scheme is designed to let each node obtain the primary reward. Noting that each node selecting resources independently may cause interference and collision which leads to instability of data transmission, a policy gradient-based resource determination algorithm is proposed. Moreover, the optimality and convergence of the PGDS method are derived. Especially, when a policy obtained by the algorithm is not matched with the optimal policy but can better deal with the interference, an asymptotic optimum still exists and is further derived.</description>

      <title>User Digital Twin-Driven Video Streaming for Customized Preferences and Adaptive Transcoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multimedia services, video streaming has become increasingly prevalent, demanding innovative solutions to enhance user experience and system efficiency. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates user digital twins-a dynamic digital representation of a user's preferences and behaviors-with traditional video streaming systems. We explore the potential of this integration to dynamically adjust video preferences and optimize transcoding processes according to real-time data. The methodology leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to continuously update the user's digital twin, which in turn informs the transcoding service to adapt video parameters for optimal quality and minimal buffering. Experimental results show that our approach not only improves the personalization of content delivery but also significantly enhances the overall efficiency of video streaming services by reducing bandwidth usage and improving video playback quality. The implications of such advancements suggest a shift towards more adaptive, user-centric multimedia services, potentially transforming how video content is consumed and delivered.</description>

      <title>Accelerator-as-a-Service in Public Clouds: An Intra-Host Traffic Management View for Performance Isolation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I/O devices in public clouds have integrated increasing numbers of hardware accelerators, e.g., AWS Nitro, Azure FPGA and Nvidia BlueField. However, such specialized compute (1) is not explicitly accessible to cloud users with performance guarantee, (2) cannot be leveraged simultaneously by both providers and users, unlike general-purpose compute (e.g., CPUs). Through ten observations, we present that the fundamental difficulty of democratizing accelerators is insufficient performance isolation support. The key obstacles to enforcing accelerator isolation are (1) too many unknown traffic patterns in public clouds and (2) too many possible contention sources in the datapath. In this work, instead of scheduling such complex traffic on-the-fly and augmenting isolation support on each system component, we propose to model traffic as network flows and proactively re-shape the traffic to avoid unpredictable contention. We discuss the implications of our findings on the design of future I/O management stacks and device interfaces.</description>

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Model for Opinion Dynamics on Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A signed graph offers richer information than an unsigned graph, since it describes both collaborative and competitive relationships in social networks. In this paper, we study the opinion dynamics on a signed graph, based on the Friedkin-Johnsen model. We first interpret the equilibrium opinion in terms of a defined random walk on an augmented signed graph, by representing the equilibrium opinion of every node as a combination of all nodes' internal opinions, with the coefficient of the internal opinion for each node being the difference of two absorbing probabilities. We then quantify some relevant social phenomena and express them in terms of the $\ell_2$ norms of vectors. We also design a nearly-linear time signed Laplacian solver for assessing these quantities, by establishing a connection between the absorbing probability of random walks on a signed graph and that on an associated unsigned graph. We further study the opinion optimization problem by changing the initial opinions of a fixed number of nodes, which can be optimally solved in cubic time. We provide a nearly-linear time algorithm with error guarantee to approximately solve the problem. Finally, we execute extensive experiments on sixteen real-life signed networks, which show that both of our algorithms are effective and efficient, and are scalable to massive graphs with over 20 million nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.02203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding heavy hitters has been of vital importance in network measurement. Among all the recent works in finding heavy hitters, the Elastic sketch achieves the highest accuracy and fastest speed. However, we find that there is still room for improvement of the Elastic sketch in finding heavy hitters. In this paper, we propose a tailored Elastic to enhance the sketch only for finding heavy hitters at the cost of losing the generality of Elastic. To tailor Elastic, we abandon the light part, and improve the eviction strategy. Our experimental results show that compared with the standard Elastic, our tailored Elastic reduces the error rate to 5.7~8.1 times and increases the speed to 2.5 times. All the related source codes and datasets are available at Github.</description>

      <title>The Efficacy of the Connect America Fund in Addressing US Internet Access Inequities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residential fixed broadband internet access in the United States (US) has long been distributed inequitably, drawing significant attention from researchers and policymakers. This paper evaluates the efficacy of the Connect America Fund (CAF), a key policy intervention aimed at addressing disparities in US internet access. CAF subsidizes the creation of new regulated broadband monopolies in underserved areas, aiming to provide comparable internet access, in terms of price and speed, to that available in urban regions. Oversight of CAF largely relies on data self-reported by internet service providers (ISPs), which is often questionable. We use the broadband-plan querying tool (BQT) to curate a novel dataset that complements ISP-reported information with ISP-advertised broadband plan details (download speed and monthly cost) on publicly accessible websites. Specifically, we query advertised broadband plans for 687k residential addresses across 15 states, certified as served by ISPs to regulators. Our analysis reveals significant discrepancies between ISP-reported data and actual broadband availability. We find that the serviceability rate-defined as the fraction of addresses ISPs actively serve out of the total queried, weighted by the number of CAF addresses in a census block group-is only 55%, dropping to as low as 18% in some states. Additionally, the compliance rate-defined as the weighted fraction of addresses where ISPs actively serve and advertise download speeds above the FCC's 10 Mbps threshold-is only 33%. We also observe that in a subset of census blocks, CAF-funded addresses receive higher broadband speeds than their monopoly-served neighbors. These results indicate that while a few users have benefited from this multi-billion dollar program, it has largely failed to achieve its intended goal, leaving many targeted rural communities with inadequate or no broadband connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The battle for a more secure Internet is waged on many fronts, including the most basic of networking protocols. Our focus is the IPv4 Identifier (IPID), an IPv4 header field as old as the Internet with an equally long history as an exploited side channel for scanning network properties, inferring off-path connections, and poisoning DNS caches. This article taxonomizes the 25-year history of IPID-based exploits and the corresponding changes to IPID selection methods. By mathematically analyzing these methods' correctness and security and empirically evaluating their performance, we reveal recommendations for best practice as well as shortcomings of current operating system implementations, emphasizing the value of systematic evaluations in network security.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can revolutionize how we deploy and operate Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) by enhancing network analytics, anomaly detection, and code generation and significantly increasing the efficiency and reliability of a plethora of O-RAN tasks. In this paper, we present ORAN-Bench-13K, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of O-RAN. Our benchmark consists of 13,952 meticulously curated multiple-choice questions generated from 116 O-RAN specification documents. We leverage a novel three-stage LLM framework, and the questions are categorized into three distinct difficulties to cover a wide spectrum of ORAN-related knowledge. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemini, Chat-GPT, and Mistral. Additionally, we propose ORANSight, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based pipeline that demonstrates superior performance on ORAN-Bench-13K compared to other tested closed-source models. Our findings indicate that current popular LLM models are not proficient in O-RAN, highlighting the need for specialized models. We observed a noticeable performance improvement when incorporating the RAG-based ORANSight pipeline, with a Macro Accuracy of 0.784 and a Weighted Accuracy of 0.776, which was on average 21.55% and 22.59% better than the other tested LLMs.</description>

      <title>TurboTLS: TLS connection establishment with 1 less round trip</title>

Abstract: We show how to establish TLS connections using one less round trip. In our approach, which we call TurboTLS, the initial client-to-server and server-to-client flows of the TLS handshake are sent over UDP rather than TCP. At the same time, in the same flights, the three-way TCP handshake is carried out. Once the TCP connection is established, the client and server can complete the final flight of the TLS handshake over the TCP connection and continue using it for application data. No changes are made to the contents of the TLS handshake protocol, only its delivery mechanism. We avoid problems with UDP fragmentation by using request-based fragmentation, in which the client sends in advance enough UDP requests to provide sufficient room for the server to fit its response with one response packet per request packet. Clients can detect which servers support this without an additional round trip, if the server advertises its support in a DNS HTTPS resource record. Experiments using our software implementation show substantial latency improvements. On reliable connections, we effectively eliminate a round trip without any noticeable cost. To ensure adequate performance on unreliable connections, we use lightweight packet ordering and buffering; we can have a client wait a very small time to receive a potentially lost packet (e.g., a fraction of the RTT observed for the first fragment) before falling back to TCP without any further delay, since the TCP connection was already in the process of being established. This approach offers substantial performance improvements with low complexity, even in heterogeneous network environments with poorly configured middleboxes.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Backscatter Connectivity via Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SARComm is a novel wireless communication system that enables passive satellite backscatter connectivity using existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals. We demonstrate that SAR signals from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite, used to image Earth's terrain, can be leveraged to enable low-power ground-to-satellite communication. This paper presents the first cooperative, on-the-ground target that modulates SAR backscatter to send information bits and analyzes how to extract them from publicly available Sentinel-1 datasets. To demonstrate the system, we evaluate the effectiveness of modulating the radar cross section of corner reflectors both mechanically and electronically to encode data bits, develop a deployment algorithm to optimize corner reflector placement, and present a SAR processing pipeline to enable communication.</description>
