      <title>Provability Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a new Kripke-style semantics for classical modal logic, named as provability models. We study provability models for the propositional modal logics K, K4, S4 GL, GLP and the interpretability logic ILM. Provability models combine features of Kripke models with the assignment of logics to individual worlds. Originally introduced in [Mojtahedi, 2022], these models allowed the first author to establish arithmetical completeness for intuitionistic provability logic. Interestingly, we show that the ILM is complete for the same provability models of GL. We improve provability models to predicative and decidable provability models in the case of GL and ILM. Furthermore, we prove a soundness and completeness of GLP for provability models.</description>

      <title>Coanalytic families of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Van Douwen families, maximal families of eventually different permutations and maximal ideal independent families we show that the existence of a $\Sigma^1_2$ family implies the existence of a $\Pi^1_1$ family of the same size. We also prove a similar, but slightly weaker result for generating sets of cofinitary groups.</description>

      <title>Consciousness As Entropy Reduction (Short Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model of consciousness is proposed which, having a logical basis, lends itself to simulation using a simple mathematical model called Consciousness as Entropy Reduction (CER). The approach has been inspired by previous models such as GWT, IIT and an earlier less mainstream model called "Feature Map" in Psychology. CER considers the contents of consciousness and subconsciousness as \textit{scenarios}: a vector of patterns (or features) on various "channels" (or feature locations). In CER, a feature map itself is not consciousness but only the input \textit{scenario} into a world of possible subconscious \textit{scenarios} from which the conscious \textit{scenario} (i.e., conscious experience) is chosen. Essentially, it creates an internal simulation of the outside world. Solving problems in simulation internally as a "thought experiment" is obviously more economical than doing experiments in a real environment and lends itself to adaptability and hence is a major evolutionary advantage. CER also has connections with the Hopfield model in artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Reversible computations are computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality serves as an abstract notion of time for concurrent systems. A computation is causal, or simply valid, if each observation of a computation event is preceded by the observation of its causes. The present work establishes that this simple requirement is equally relevant when the occurrence of an event is invertible. We propose a conservative extension of causal models for concurrency that accommodates reversible computations. We first model reversible computations using a symmetric residuation operation in the general model of configuration structures. We show that stable configuration structures, which correspond to prime algebraic domains, remain stable under the action of this residuation. We then derive a semantics of reversible computations for prime event structures, which is shown to coincide with a switch operation that dualizes conflict and causality.</description>

      <title>Logical Dependence of Physical Determinism on Set-theoretic Metatheory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baroque questions of set-theoretic foundations are widely assumed to be irrelevant to physics. In this article, I demonstrate that this assumption is incorrect. I show that the fundamental physical question of whether a theory is deterministic, whether it fixes a unique future given the present, can depend on one's choice of set-theoretic axiom candidates over which there is intractable disagreement. This dependence is not confined to hypothetical examples. It reaches into mainstream and frontier physics, including the dynamics of Kerr-like black hole interiors. One upshot of the discussion is that either physical theories must be relativized to set-theoretic metatheories (in which case physics itself becomes relative), or the search for new axioms to settle undecidables may admit of empirical input.</description>

      <title>Totally Disconnected (non-metric) Gelfand Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize those algebras over a disconnected uniformly complete topological field which are representable as algebras of continuous functions on compact topological spaces, generalizing thus Gelfand duality for non-archimedean normed fields (Van der Put theorem). More generally, we establish for any topological field F a (dual) adjunction between the category of compact F-Tychonoff spaces and a natural category of commutative F-algebras, which becomes a duality for fields satisfying the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. To obtain these results we do not utilize analytic tools, but the canonical group uniformity of the field and intrinsic properties of the algebras.</description>
