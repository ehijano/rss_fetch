      <title>On the measurement problem in quantum mechanics: a simple proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the problems connected with the interpretation of quantum mechanics are enumerated, in particular those related to some well known paradoxes and, above all, to the measurement process. We then show how the so called "Physics Laboratory Assumption" introduced in [1], which considers as "observables'' only the self-adjoint operators corresponding to existing measuring instruments, can propose a new perspective on the aforementioned problems and can replace the wavefunction collapse postulate.

      <title>Classical vs quantum dynamics and the onset of chaos in a macrospin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a periodically driven macrospin system with anisotropic long-range interactions and collective dissipation, described by a Lindblad master equation. In the thermodynamic limit ($N\to\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.</description>

      <title>Pauli stabilizer formalism for topological quantum field theories and generalized statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00064v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on lattices and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general dimensions. We develop a lattice description of extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics. Our main example is the (4+1)D fermionic-loop toric code, obtained by condensing the $e^2m^2$-loop in the (4+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in (4+1)D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^5(B^2G,U(1))$. Beyond (4+1)D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in (6+1)D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the fermionic-membrane toric code and the fermionic-volume toric code. In addition, we demonstrate that $p$-dimensional excitations in $2p+2$ spatial dimensions can support anyonic $p$-brane statistics for only even $p$.</description>

      <title>Detection Efficiency Bounds in (Semi-)Device-Independent Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive review of the critical role of detection efficiency in demonstrating non-classicality across various device-independent and semi-device-independent scenarios. The central focus is the detection loophole, a challenge in which imperfect detectors can allow classical hidden variable models to mimic quantum correlations, thus masking genuine non-classicality. As a review, the article revisits the paradigmatic Bell scenario, detailing the efficiency requirements for the CHSH inequality, such as the 2/3 threshold for symmetric efficiencies, and traces the historical trajectory toward the first loophole-free tests. The analysis extends to other causal structures to explore how efficiency requirements are affected in different contexts. These include the instrumental scenario, which for binary variables has recently been shown to follow the same inefficiency bounds as the bipartite dichotomic Bell scenario; the prepare-and-measure scenario, where inefficiencies impact the certification of a quantum system's dimension and create security breaches in protocols such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD); and the bilocality scenario, which exemplifies how employing multiple independent sources can significantly relax the required efficiencies to certify non-classical correlations.</description>

      <title>Double-Pumped Kerr Parametric Amplifier Beyond the Gain-Bandwidth Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting standing$-$wave parametric amplifiers are crucial for the readout of microwave quantum devices. Despite significant improvements in recent years, the need to operate near an instability point imposes a fundamental constraint: the instantaneous bandwidth decreases with increasing amplifier gain. Here we show that it is possible to obtain parametric amplification without instability by using two simultaneous drives that activate phase-preserving gain and frequency conversion. Realized in a granular aluminum dimer with Kerr nonlinearity, our method demonstrates a sixfold bandwidth increase at 20 dB gain, surpasses the conventional gain$-$bandwidth scaling up to 25 dB, and remains near the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>A compellingly simple proof of the speed of sound for interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On physical grounds, one expects locally interacting quantum many-body systems to feature a finite group velocity. This intuition is rigorously underpinned by Lieb-Robinson bounds that state that locally interacting Hamiltonians with finite-dimensional constituents on suitably regular lattices always exhibit such a finite group velocity. This also implies that causality is always respected by the dynamics of quantum lattice models. It had been a long-standing open question whether interacting bosonic systems also feature finite speeds of sound in information and particle propagation, which was only recently resolved. This work proves a strikingly simple such bound for particle propagation - shown in literally a few elementary, yet not straightforward, lines - for generalized Bose-Hubbard models defined on general lattices, proving that appropriately locally perturbed stationary states feature a finite speed of sound in particle numbers.</description>

      <title>Towards a temperature-insensitive composite diamond clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency references based on solid state spins promise simplicity, compactness, robustness, multifunctionality, ease of integration, and high densities of emitters. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a natural candidate, but the electronic zero-field splitting exhibits a large fractional temperature dependence, which has precluded its use as a stable clock transition. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by forming a composite frequency reference that combines measurements of the electronic splitting D with the nuclear quadrupole splitting of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin intrinsic to the NV center. We further benchmark this composite approach against alternative strategies for mitigating temperature sensitivity. By implementing a specially designed pulse sequence with an eight-phase control scheme that suppresses pulse imperfections, we interleave measurements of D and Q in a high-density NV ensemble and demonstrate a temperature-compensated composite frequency reference. The stability of this composite diamond clock is characterized over a 10-day period at room temperature through a comparison to a Rb vapor-cell clock, yielding a fractional instability below $5 \times 10^{-9}$ for an averaging time of $\tau = 200$ s and below $1 \times 10^{-8}$ at $\tau = 2 \times 10^5$ s, corresponding to measured improvements by a factor of 4 and 200, respectively, over a clock based purely on the single frequency D for the same periods. By characterizing the residual sensitivity to magnetic fields, optical power, and radio-frequency drive amplitudes, we find that temperature is no longer the dominant source of instability. These results establish complementary electron- and nuclear-spin transitions in diamond as a viable route to thermally robust frequency metrology, providing a pathway toward compact, multifunctional solid-state clocks and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Reversing Heat Flow by Coherence in a Multipartite Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics dictates that heat flows spontaneously from a high-temperature entity to a lower-temperature one. Yet, recent advances have demonstrated that quantum correlations between a system and its thermal environment can induce a reversal of heat flow, challenging classical thermodynamic expectations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that internal quantum coherence in a multipartite spin system can also reverse heat flow, without relying on initial correlations with the environment. Under the collision model with cascade interaction, we verify that both the strength and the phase of the coherence term determine the direction and magnitude of energy transfer. These results enable precise control of heat flow using only local quantum properties.</description>

      <title>DC-MBQC: A Distributed Compilation Framework for Measurement-Based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a promising technique for scaling up quantum systems. While significant progress has been made in DQC for quantum circuit models, there exists much less research on DQC for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), which is a universal quantum computing model that is essentially different from the circuit model and particularly well-suited to photonic quantum platforms. In this paper, we propose DC-MBQC, the first distributed quantum compilation framework tailored for MBQC. We identify and address two key challenges in enabling DQC for MBQC. First, for task allocation among quantum processing units (QPUs), we develop an adaptive graph partitioning algorithm that preserves the structure of the graph state while balancing the workload across QPUs. Second, for inter-QPU communication, we introduce the layer scheduling problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Regrading realistic hardware requirements, we optimize the execution time of running quantum programs and the corresponding required photon lifetime to avoid fatal failures caused by photon loss. Our experiments demonstrate a $7.46\times$ improvement on required photon lifetime and $6.82\times$ speedup with 8 fully-connected QPUs, which further confirm the advantage of distributed quantum computing in photonic systems.

      <title>Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching for Quantum Error Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires Quantum Error Correction (QEC). QEC reduces error rates by encoding logical information across redundant physical qubits, enabling errors to be detected and corrected. A common decoder used for this task is Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) a graph-based algorithm that relies on edge weights to identify the most likely error chains. In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM). Our decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract local syndrome features and Transformers to capture long-range global dependencies, which are then used to predict dynamic edge weights for the MWPM decoder. To facilitate training through the non-differentiable MWPM algorithm, we formulate a novel proxy loss function that enables end-to-end optimization. Our findings demonstrate significant performance reduction in the Logical Error Rate (LER) over standard baselines, highlighting the advantage of hybrid decoders that combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic structure of classical matching.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of single particle Hamiltonians in exponentially reduced qubit space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and near-term quantum hardware is constrained by limited qubit counts, circuit depth, and the high cost of repeated measurements. We address these challenges for solid state Hamiltonians by introducing a logarithmic-qubit encoding that maps a system with $N$ physical sites onto only $\lceil \log_2 N \rceil$ qubits while maintaining a clear correspondence with the underlying physical model. Within this reduced register, we construct a compatible variational circuit and a Gray-code-inspired measurement strategy whose number of global settings grows only logarithmically with system size. To quantify the overall hardware load, we introduce a volumetric efficiency metric that combines the number of qubit, circuit depth, and the number of measurement settings into a single measure, expressing the overall computation costs. Using this metric, we show that the total space-time-sampling volume required in a variational loop can be reduced dramatically from $N^2$ to $(logN)^3$ for hardware efficient ansatz, allowing an exponential reduction in time and size of the quantum hardware. These results demonstrate that large, structured solid-state Hamiltonians can be simulated on substantially smaller quantum registers with controlled sampling overhead and manageable circuit complexity, extending the reach of variational quantum algorithms on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>First appearance of quasiprobability negativity in quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiprobability distributions capture aspects of quantum dynamics that have no classical counterpart, yet the dynamical emergence of their negativity in many-body systems remains largely unexplored. We introduce the \emph{first-time negativity} (FTN) of the Margenau-Hill quasiprobability as a dynamical indicator of when local measurement sequences in an interacting quantum system begin to exhibit genuinely nonclassical behavior. Using the Ising chain, we show that FTN discriminates clearly between interaction-dominated and field-dominated regimes, is systematically reshaped by temperature, and responds sensitively to the breaking of integrability. When measurements are performed on different sites, FTN reveals a characteristic spatio-temporal structure that reflects the finite-time spreading of operator incompatibility across the lattice. We further compare the numerical onset of negativity with a recently proposed quantum speed limit (QSL) for quasiprobabilities, which provides a geometric benchmark for the observed dynamics. Our results identify FTN as a practical and experimentally accessible probe of real-time quantum coherence and contextuality, directly suited to current platforms capable of sequential weak and strong measurements.</description>

      <title>Nature is stingy: Universality of Scrooge ensembles in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to the ensemble of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>When Does Quantum Differential Privacy Compose?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composition is a cornerstone of classical differential privacy, enabling strong end-to-end guarantees for complex algorithms through composition theorems (e.g., basic and advanced). In the quantum setting, however, privacy is defined operationally against arbitrary measurements, and classical composition arguments based on scalar privacy-loss random variables no longer apply. As a result, it has remained unclear when meaningful composition guarantees can be obtained for quantum differential privacy (QDP).
  In this work, we clarify both the limitations and possibilities of composition in the quantum setting. We first show that classical-style composition fails in full generality for POVM-based approximate QDP: even quantum channels that are individually perfectly private can completely lose privacy when combined through correlated joint implementations. We then identify a setting in which clean composition guarantees can be restored. For tensor-product channels acting on product neighboring inputs, we introduce a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function. Although the resulting R\'enyi-type divergence does not satisfy a data-processing inequality, we prove that controlling its moments suffices to bound measured R\'enyi divergence, yielding operational privacy guarantees against arbitrary measurements. This leads to advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as in the classical theory.
  Our results demonstrate that meaningful composition theorems for quantum differential privacy require carefully articulated structural assumptions on channels, inputs, and adversarial measurements, and provide a principled framework for understanding which classical ideas do and do not extend to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Entanglement Distillation and Cost under Approximately Nonentangling and Dually Nonentangling Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation and entanglement cost are fundamental tasks in quantum entanglement theory. This work studies both in the probabilistic setting and focuses on the asymptotic error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation when the operational model is $\delta$-approximately nonentangling(ANE) and $\delta$-approximately dually nonentangling(ADNE) quantum instruments. While recent progress has clarified limitations of probabilistic transformations in general resource theories, an analytic formula for the error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation under approximately (dually) nonentangling operations has remained unavailable.
  Building on the framework of postselected quantum hypothesis testing, we establish a direct connection between probabilistic distillation and postselected hypothesis testing against the set of separable states. In particular, we derive an analytical characterization of the distillation error exponent under ANE. Besides, we relate the exponent to postselected hypothesis testing with measurements restricted to be separable. We further investigate probabilistic entanglement dilution and establish a relation between probabilistic entanglement costs under approximately nonentangling and approximately dually nonentangling instruments, together with a bound on the probabilistic entanglement cost under nonentangling instruments</description>

      <title>The Maximal Entanglement Limit in Statistical and High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures advocate the idea that quantum entanglement provides a unifying foundation for both statistical physics and high-energy interactions. I argue that, at sufficiently long times or high energies, most quantum systems approach a Maximal Entanglement Limit (MEL) in which phases of quantum states become unobservable, reduced density matrices acquire a thermal form, and probabilistic descriptions emerge without invoking ergodicity or classical randomness. Within this framework, the emergence of probabilistic parton model, thermalization in the break-up of confining strings and in high-energy collisions, and the universal small $x$ behavior of structure functions arise as direct consequences of entanglement and geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Chip scale superconducting quantum gravimeter based on a SQUID transmon mechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise gravitational measurements are vital for geophysics and inertial navigation, but current platforms struggle to combine absolute accuracy with high-bandwidth tracking. We address this challenge with a chip-scale superconducting gravimeter that couples a flux-tunable transmon qubit to a high-$Q$ mechanical resonator. We embed the mechanical element inside the qubit's SQUID loop. This allows us to exploit the Josephson potential's nonlinearity, creating a motion-dependent inductance that maps gravitational displacement onto the qubit's geometric phase. Using a stroboscopic measurement protocol, we suppress mechanical decoherence at revival times. This yields a predicted sensitivity of $10^2\,\mathrm{nGal}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, approaching the performance of atomic sensors but with kilohertz-rate sampling. With electrical {in situ} tunability and SI traceability via microwave spectroscopy, this architecture offers a practical route to high-speed, quantum-limited on-chip gravimetry.</description>

      <title>Multistep quantum master equation theory for response functions in four wave mixing electronic spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides an alternative derivation of third order response functions in four wave mixing spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecular systems considering only single exciton states. For the case of harmonic oscillator bath linearly and diagonally coupled to exciton states, closed form expressions showing all the explicit time dependences are derived. These expressions can provide more solid physical basis for understanding 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy signals. For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.</description>

      <title>Prediction of a measurable sign change in the Casimir force using a magnetic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum levitation controlled by Casimir forces acting between a polystyrene surface and a Teflon-coated metallic substrate immersed in a mixture of Toluene and magnetite particles. This system experiences repulsion-attraction transitions in the Casimir interaction for distances where the effect is measurable. This Casimir trapping can be controlled by clever choices of metallic and ferrofluid materials, which are directly linked to the emergence of the trapping effect. Thermal and quantum contributions are investigated in detail, showing how the optical and magnetic properties of the ferrofluid and other materials affect the magnitude of the trapping and its distance range of observability.</description>

      <title>A Geometrical Design Tool for Building Cost-Effective Layout-Aware n-Bit Quantum Gates Using the Bloch Sphere Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional design technique of any n-bit quantum gate is mainly achieved using unitary matrices multiplication, where n &gt;= 2 and 1 &lt;= m &lt;= n-1 for m target qubits and n-m control qubits. These matrices represent quantum rotations by an n-bit quantum gate. For a quantum designer, such a conventional technique requires extensive computational time and effort, which may generate an n-bit quantum gate with a too high quantum cost. The Bloch sphere is only utilized as a visualization tool to verify the conventional design correctness for quantum rotations by a quantum gate. In contrast, this paper introduces a new concept of using the Bloch sphere as a "geometrical design tool" to build cost-effective n-bit quantum gates with lower quantum costs. This concept is termed the "Bloch sphere approach (BSA)". In BSA, a cost-effective n-bit quantum gate is built without using any unitary matrices multiplication. Instead, the quantum rotations for such a gate are visually selected using the geometrical planar intersections of the Bloch sphere. The BSA can efficiently map m targets among n-m controls for an n-bit quantum gate, to satisfy the limited layout connectivity for the physical neighboring qubits of a quantum computer. Experimentally, n-bit quantum gates built using the BSA always have lower quantum costs than those for such gates built using the conventional quantum design techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the band structure and topological phases of one- and two-dimensional bipartite atomic lattices mediated by long-range dissipative radiative coupling. By deriving an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for the single-excitation sector, we demonstrate that the low-energy dynamics of the system are governed by a Dirac equation with a complex Fermi velocity. We analyze the associated topological invariants for both the SSH and honeycomb models, utilizing synthetic gauge fields to break time-reversal symmetry in the latter. Finally, we explicitly verify the non-Hermitian bulk-edge correspondence by deriving analytical solutions for edge states localized at domain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Casimir interactions and drift currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ergodic properties of a unitary Floquet dynamics arising from the repeated application of a translationally-invariant Clifford Quantum Cellular Automata to an infinite system of qubits in d dimensions. One expects that if the QCA does not exhibit any periodicity, a generic initial state of qubits will thermalize, that is, approach the infinite-temperature state. We show that this is true for many classes of states, both pure and mixed. In particular, this is true for all initial states that are short-range entangled and close to the equilibrium state. We also point out a subtle distinction between weak and strong thermalization.</description>

      <title>Photonic Reservoir Engineering via 2D $\Lambda$-Type Atomic Arrays in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in $\Lambda$-type atomic systems underpins quantum technologies such as high-fidelity memory and nonlinear optics, but conventional setups face intrinsic limitations. Standard geometries of one-dimensional atomic chains coupled to waveguides allow only a single bright superradiant channel, while subradiant modes remain weakly accessible, limiting control over collective radiative behavior and dark-state pathways. This leads to unwanted inelastic processes, degrading memory fidelity and reducing nonlinear photon generation efficiency. Here, we propose two two-dimensional (2D) atomic lattice geometries coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide, namely Zigzag and Orthogonal structures. In the Zigzag model, engineered collective super- and subradiant modes produce a flattened EIT window, broadening the transmission bandwidth and suppressing unwanted scattering to enhance quantum memory fidelity. In the Orthogonal model, four-wave mixing (FWM) intensity is amplified by up to six orders of magnitude relative to a conventional one-dimensional $\Lambda$-type EIT chain with identical $\Gamma_{1D}$, $\Omega_c$, and probe intensity, with localized idler photons forming well-defined spectral modes. These results demonstrate a versatile route to engineer structured photonic reservoirs for on-demand photon generation, high-fidelity quantum storage, and enhanced nonlinear optical processes.</description>

      <title>Experimental exclusion of a generalized K\'arolyh\'azy gravity-induced decoherence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new experimental constraints on the generalized version of the gravity-induced decoherence model originally proposed by K\'arolyh\'azy. Using data collected by the VIP Collaboration at the INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory with a high-purity germanium detector, we derive an improved lower bound on the spatial correlation length $R_K$ characterizing metric fluctuations in the model. We obtain a bound $R_K &gt; 4.64$ m (95\% C.L.), which exceeds by more than an order of magnitude the previous experimental limit. When combined with the theoretical upper bound $R_K &lt;1.98$ m derived from macroscopic localization requirements, our result excludes the generalized K\'arolyh\'azy model. The same conclusion applies to an associated non-Markovian formulation of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model. Our findings significantly tighten experimental constraints on gravity-related decoherence scenarios and demonstrate the sensitivity of underground low-background experiments to foundational modifications of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at providing an accessible introduction to ultracold quantum gravimeters tailored for geophysicists. We do not focus here on geophysical applications, as these are already well known to geophysicists, but rather provide a pedagogical exposition of the quantum-mechanical concepts needed to understand the operation of quantum gravimeters. We present a review of gravimeters based on two- and three-level atomic systems, focusing on the fundamental mechanisms of atomic interferometry. The functioning of Mach-Zehnder interferometers is discussed through the action of $\pi/2$ and $\pi$ pulses, showing how the resulting phase shift encodes gravitational acceleration. The effect of noise is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of Donor-Acceptor Quantum Coherence and Non-Markovian Bath on the Distance Dependence of Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate information on the distance dependence of resonance energy transfer (RET) is crucial for its utilization as a spectroscopic ruler \re{of} nanometer scale distances. In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\"{o}rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation.</description>

      <title>Assessing Quantum Annealing to Solve the Minimum Vertex Multicut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybersecurity in telecommunication networks often leads to hard combinatorial optimization problems that are challenging to solve with classical methods. This work investigates the practical feasibility of using quantum annealing to address the Restricted Vertex Minimum Multicut Problem. The problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model and implemented on D-Wave s quantum annealer. Rather than focusing on solution quality alone, we analyze key aspects of the quantum workflow including minor embedding techniques, chain length, topology constraints, chain strength selection, unembedding procedures, and postprocessing. Our results show that quantum annealing faces substantial hardware-level constraints limitations in embedding and scalability, especially for large instances, while hybrid quantum-classical solvers provide improved feasibility. This study offers a realistic assessment of the D-Wave system s current capabilities and identifies crucial parameters that govern the success of quantum optimization in cybersecurity-related network problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the minimum edge multiway cut problem, a fundamental task in evaluating the resilience of telecommunication networks. This study benchmarks the problem across three quantum computing paradigms: quantum annealing on a D-Wave quantum processing unit, photonic variational quantum circuits simulated on Quandela s Perceval platform, and IBM s gate-based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We assess the comparative feasibility of these approaches for early-stage quantum optimization, highlighting trade-offs in circuit constraints, encoding overhead, and scalability. Our findings suggest that quantum annealing currently offers the most scalable performance for this class of problems, while photonic and gate-based approaches remain limited by hardware and simulation depth. These results provide actionable insights for designing quantum workflows targeting combinatorial optimization in telecom security and resilience analysis.</description>

      <title>Geometric Complexity of Quantum Channels via Unitary Dilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity provides a Riemannian framework for quantifying the cost of implementing unitary (closed--system) dynamics. For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Certified Bounds for Quantum Regression: A Scalable Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a training-free, certified error bound for quantum regression derived directly from Pauli expectation values. Generalizing the heuristic of minimum accuracy from classification to regression, we evaluate axis-aligned predictors within the Pauli feature space. We formally prove that the optimal axis-aligned predictor constitutes a rigorous upper bound on the minimum training Mean Squared Error (MSE) attainable by any linear or kernel-based regressor defined on the same quantum feature map. Since computing this exact bound requires an intractable scan of the full Pauli basis, we introduce a Monte Carlo framework to efficiently estimate it using a tractable subset of measurement axes. We further provide non-asymptotic statistical guarantees to certify performance within a practical measurement budget. This method enables rapid comparison of quantum feature maps and early diagnosis of expressivity, allowing for the informed selection of architectures before deploying higher-complexity models.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Accelerated Sampling of Pauli Strings for Nonstabilizerness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magic, quantified by nonstabilizerness, measures departures from stabilizer structure and underlies potential quantum speedups. We introduce an efficient classical algorithm that exactly computes stabilizer R\'enyi entropies and stabilizer nullity for generic many-body wavefunctions of $N$ qubits. The method combines the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with an exact partition of Pauli operators. It achieves an exponential speedup over direct approaches, reducing the average cost per sampled Pauli string from $O(2^N)$ to $O(N)$. Building on this framework, we further develop a Monte-Carlo estimator for stabilizer R\'enyi entropies together with a Clifford-based variance-reduction scheme that suppresses sampling fluctuations. We benchmark the accuracy and efficiency on ensembles of random magic states, and apply the method to random Clifford circuits with doped $T$ gates, comparing different doping architectures. Our approach applies to arbitrary quantum states and provides quantitative access to magic resources both encoded in highly entangled states and generated by long-time nonequilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>On orthoposets of numerical events in quantum logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let S be a set of states of a physical system and p(s) the probability of the occurrence of an event when the system is in state s in S. Such a function p from S to [0,1] is known as a numerical event or more accurately an S-probability. A set P of numerical events including the constant functions 0 and 1 and 1-p with every p in P becomes a poset when ordered by the order of real functions and can serve as a general setting for quantum logics. We call such a poset P a general set of events (GSE). The thoroughly investigated algebras of S-probabilities (including Hilbert logics), concrete logics and Boolean algebras can all be represented within this setting. In this paper we study various classes of GSEs, in particular those that are orthoposets and their interrelations and connections to known logics. Moreover, we characterize GSEs as posets by means of states and discuss the situation for GSEs to be lattices.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in a closed quantum system from randomized dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of statistical mechanics from quantum dynamics is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. Deriving observables aligned with the prediction of the canonical ensemble for a quantum system relies on the presence of a bath provided either as an external environment or as a larger part of a closed system. We demonstrate that thermal (canonical) observables for a whole closed quantum system of finite size can arise in the absence of a bath. These thermal observables stem from classical averaging over randomized unitary evolutions for a few-body system. The temperature in the canonical ensemble appears as a global constraint on the total energy of the system, determined by the choice of the initial state. From averaging randomized evolutions, we derive spin-spin correlation functions for a finite spin chain and show that they exhibit a temperature-dependent finite correlation length, in agreement with the prediction of the canonical ensemble. This establishes a method for computing thermal observables in a closed, finite-size system from real-time propagation without a bath. An implementation of this thermalization approach on a quantum computer can be utilized for thermal state preparation.</description>

      <title>Automated electrostatic characterization of quantum dot devices in single- and bilayer heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</description>

      <title>Anderson localisation in spatially structured random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Anderson localisation on high-dimensional graphs with spatial structure induced by long-ranged but distance-dependent hopping. To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios.</description>

      <title>Bridging Commutant and Polynomial Methods for Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum model exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) if its Hilbert space decomposes into exponentially many dynamically disconnected subspaces, known as Krylov subspaces. A model may however have different HSFs depending on the method for identifying them. Here we establish a connection between two vastly distinct methods recently proposed for identifying HSF: the commutant algebra (CA) method and integer characteristic polynomial factorization (ICPF) method. For a Hamiltonian consisting of operators admitting rational number matrix representations, we prove a theorem that, if its center of commutant algebra have all eigenvalues being rational, the HSF from the ICPF method must be equal to or finer than that from the CA method. We show that this condition is satisfied by most known models exhibiting HSF, for which we demonstrate the validity of our theorem. We further discuss representative models for which ICPF and CA methods yield different HSFs. Our results may facilitate the exploration of a unified definition of HSF.</description>

      <title>Quantum King-Ring Domination in Chess: A QAOA Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is extensively benchmarked on synthetic random instances such as MaxCut, TSP, and SAT problems, but these lack semantic structure and human interpretability, offering limited insight into performance on real-world problems with meaningful constraints. We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p&lt;10^{-7}, d\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p&lt;10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p&lt;10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\% and random selection by 80.1\%. Our results demonstrate that structured benchmarks reveal advantages of problem-informed QAOA techniques obscured in random instances. We release all code, data, and experimental artifacts for reproducible NISQ algorithm research.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise from Electron-Hole Asymmetry in Normal and Superconducting Quantum Point Contacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines $\Delta_T$ noise in two-terminal hybrid nanostructures featuring a quantum point contact (QPC), realized either between two normal metals (NQN) or between a normal metal and a superconductor (NQS). The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $\Delta_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $\Delta_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $\Delta_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $\Delta_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $\Delta_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime.</description>

      <title>Large-party limit of topological entanglement entropy in Chern-Simons theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological entanglement entropy of quantum states arising in the context of three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and Chern-Simons level $k$. We focus on the quantum states associated with the $T_{dm,dn}$ torus link complements, which is a $d$-party pure quantum state, and analyze its large-party limit, i.e., $d\to \infty$ limit. We show that the entanglement measures in this limit will receive contributions only from the Abelian anyons, and non-Abelian sectors are suppressed in the large-party limit. Consequently, the large-party limiting value of the entanglement entropy has an upper bound of $\ln |Z_G|$, where $|Z_G|$ is the order of the center of the group $G$. As an explicit example, we perform quantitative analysis for the simplest case of the SU(2) group and $T_{d,dn}$ torus link to obtain the large-party limit of the entanglement entropy. We further investigate the semiclassical ($k \to \infty$) limit of the entropies after taking the large-party limit for this particular example.</description>

      <title>The JLMS formula in a large code with approximate error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge/gravity duality is often described as a quantum error correcting code. However, as seen in the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh (JLMS) formula, exact quantum error correction with complementary recovery (and thus entanglement wedge reconstruction) emerges only in the limit $G \to 0$. As a result, precise arguments controlling error terms have focused on what we call `small' codes which, as $G \to 0$, describe only perturbative excitations near a given classical solution. Such settings are quite restrictive and, in particular, they prohibit discussion of any modular flow that would change the classical background. As a result, they forbid consideration of modular flows generated by semiclassical bulk states at order-one modular parameters.
  In contrast, we present a single `large' code for the bulk theory that can accommodate such flows and, in particular, in the $G \to 0$ limit includes superpositions of states associated with distinct classical backgrounds. This large code is assembled from small codes that each satisfy an approximate Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula. In this extended setting we clarify the meaning of the (approximate) JLMS relation between bulk and boundary modular Hamiltonians and quantify its validity in an appropriate class of states.</description>

Abstract: Light harvesting 2 (LH2) complex is a primary component of the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria that is responsible for harvesting and relaying excitons. The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.</description>

      <title>Coordination-driven magic numbers in protonated argon clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural properties of rare-gas clusters can be primarily described by a simple sphere packing model or by pairwise interactions. Remarkably, adding a single proton yields a large set of magic numbers that has remained unexplained. In this Letter, we unravel their origin by combining quantum Monte Carlo techniques with many-body ab initio potentials that correctly capture the proton's coordination environment. Thanks to this approach, we find that argon atoms are mainly localized around the classical minimum, resulting in a particularly rigid behavior in stark contrast to lighter rare-gas clusters. Moreover, as cluster size increases, we identify a clear structural transition from many-body coordination-driven stability to a regime dominated by two-body interactions, reflecting a reshaping of the underlying potential energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian Magnon Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A defining quantity of a physical system is its energy which is represented by the Hamiltonian. In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spectral Singularities and Topological Lasers in PT-Symmetric Weyl Semimetals</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the unique properties of PT-symmetric Topological Weyl Semimetals (TWS) within the framework of non-Hermitian physics, focusing on their potential for generating topological lasers. By exploring the role of spectral singularities and their relationship to exceptional points, we examine how these materials, characterized by Weyl nodes and topologically protected surface states, can support novel optical phenomena such as unidirectional propagation and enhanced lasing. Through a theoretical model based on the transfer matrix approach, we reveal how the interplay between the PT symmetry and the axion term introduces new dynamics, leading to 12 distinct topological laser configurations. The study also investigates the impact of the $\theta$-term on spectral singularities, showing how it quantizes the system's gain values and influences the topological properties of the lasers. By applying our model to the TaAs material, a known Weyl semimetal, we uncover previously unreported effects, demonstrating the potential of PT-symmetric TWS materials for advanced optoelectronic applications. We show that the axion-induced cyclotron-like Hall current in a PT-symmetric TWS medium, revealing its topological characteristics and distinct flow patterns in the gain and loss regions, which serve as indicators of the system's topological symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for the development of robust, tunable, and efficient topological lasers with applications in quantum information processing and beyond.</description>

Abstract: High-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, are genuine quantum machines, so, in line with Richard Feynman's original motivation for Quantum Computing, the scattering processes that take place there are natural candidates to be simulated on a quantum system. Potential applications range from quantum machine learning methods for collider data analysis, to faster and more precise evaluations of intricate multiloop Feynman diagrams, more efficient jet clustering, improved simulations of parton showers, and many other tasks. In this work, the focus will be on two specific applications: first, the identification of the causal structure of multiloop vacuum amplitudes, a key ingredient of the Loop-Tree Duality and an area with deep connections to graph theory; and second, the integration and sampling of high-dimensional functions. The latter constitutes a first step toward the realization of a fully fledged quantum event generator operating at high perturbative orders.</description>

      <title>The Ground State Energy of a Mean-Field Fermi Gas in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously establish a formula for the correlation energy of a two-dimensional Fermi gas in the mean-field regime for potentials whose Fourier transform $\hat{V}$ satisfies $\hat{V}(\cdot) | \cdot | \in \ell^1$. Further, we establish the analogous upper bound for $\hat{V}(\cdot)^2 | \cdot |^{1 + \varepsilon} \in \ell^1$, which includes the Coulomb potential $\hat{V}(k) \sim |k|^{-2}$. The proof is based on an approximate bosonization using slowly growing patches around the Fermi surface. In contrast to recent proofs in the three-dimensional case, we need a refined analysis of low-energy excitations, as they are less numerous, but carry larger contributions.</description>

      <title>Biased-Noise Thresholds of Zero-Rate Holographic Codes with Tensor-Network Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial insight for practical quantum error correction is that different types of errors, such as single-qubit Pauli operators, typically occur with different probabilities. Finding an optimal quantum code under such biased noise is a challenging problem, related to the (generally unknown) maximum capacity of the corresponding noisy channel. A benchmark for this capacity is given by the hashing bound, which describes the performance of random stabilizer codes and leads to the matter of identifying codes that come close to the bound while also being efficiently decodable. In this work, we perform the first comprehensive analysis of asymptotically zero-rate holographic codes under biased noise. We show that many representatives from such models of this code class fulfill both the channel optimality and efficient decoding guarantees for tensor-network codes. In fact, all holographic codes tested were found to reach the hashing bound in some bias regime, while several built from the $\codepar{5,1,2}$ surface code and $\codepar{6,1,3}$ code exceed state-of-the-art code performance in the 2-Pauli noise regime. Furthermore, we consider Clifford deformations which allow all considered codes to reach the hashing bound for 1-Pauli noise as well. Our results establish that holographic codes, which were previously shown to possess efficient tensor-network decoders, also exhibit competitive thresholds under biased noise.</description>

      <title>Pure and Mixed State Entanglement Dynamics in Tavis-Cummings Model with Squeezed Coherent Thermal States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18466v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement dynamics of two atoms interacting with a single-mode cavity field within the Tavis-Cummings model in the presence of noise. The atoms are initially prepared in either pure Bell states or mixed Werner states, allowing a direct comparison of pure- and mixed-state entanglement. The cavity field is described by generalized single-mode squeezed coherent thermal states, incorporating both thermal and quantum noise effects.
  Atom-atom and atom-field entanglement are quantified using concurrence and negativity, respectively. We analyze entanglement sudden death and revival, and examine how Ising-type coupling, dipole-dipole interaction, Kerr nonlinearity, and detuning modify the entanglement dynamics. Our results show that thermal photons generally suppress entanglement and enhance sudden death, while squeezing counteracts these effects. The influence of nonlinearities and interatomic interactions depends sensitively on the purity of the initial atomic state, leading to qualitatively different behaviors for Bell and Werner states.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for bidirectional teleportation of a single qubit using quantum walks on two independent one dimensional lattices and two independent cycles with four vertices, employing nearest neighbor jumps with coin outcomes. In addition, we discuss two different methods for two qubit teleportation by employing nearest neighbor jumps and next nearest neighbor jumps with a single coin and two coins, respectively. Finally, we show that the two qubit single jump quantum walk and the two jump quantum walk teleportation schemes yield the same results.</description>

      <title>LEGO_HQEC: Automating the Analysis, Construction, and Decoding of Holographic Quantum Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a crucial prerequisite for future large-scale quantum computation. Finding and analyzing new QEC codes, along with efficient decoding and fault-tolerance protocols, is central to this effort. Holographic codes are a recent class of generalized concatenated codes derived from holographic bulk/boundary dualities. In addition to exploring the physics of such dualities, these codes possess useful QEC properties such as tunable encoding rates, distance scaling competitive with other well-studied code classes,and excellent recovery thresholds. To allow for a comprehensive analysis of holographic code constructions, we introduce LEGO_HQEC, a software package utilizing the quantum LEGO formalism. This package allows for the construction and analysis of holographic codes on regular hyperbolic tilings, computing their stabilizer generators and logical operators for a specified number of seed codes and layers. Three decoders are included: an erasure decoder based on Gaussian elimination; an integeroptimization decoder; and a tensor-network decoder. With these tools, LEGO_HQEC enables systematic studies of both previously known holographic codes and novel variants. As a demonstration, we provide new numerical results on the holographic blackhole pentagon code, establishing its threshold behavior under the erasure channel as a benchmark example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selecting optimal kernels for regression in physical systems remains a challenge, often relying on trial-and-error with standard functions. In this work, we establish a mathematical correspondence between support vector machine kernels and quantum propagators, demonstrating that kernel efficacy is determined by its spectral alignment with the system's Green's function. Based on this isomorphism, we propose a unified, physics-informed framework for kernel selection and design. For systems with known propagator forms, we derive analytical selection rules that map standard kernels to physical operators. For complex systems where the Green's function is analytically intractable, we introduce a constructive numerical method using the Kernel Polynomial Method with Jackson smoothing to generate custom, physics-aligned kernels. Numerical experiments spanning electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, anharmonic oscillators, and photonic crystals demonstrate that this framework consistently performs well as long as there is an alignment with a Green's function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary gate dynamics in driven quantum systems beyond the rotating-wave approximation. QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By accounting for the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate that high-fidelity two-qubit gates in strongly driven systems are achievable by going beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The QAT results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong coupling regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a unitarity-preserving generalized Floquet framework for analytically modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generic cavity QED setup under conditions where the coupling between the two-level systems and a single bosonic mode is significantly degraded by low-frequency noise. To overcome this problem, we identify pulsed dynamical decoupling strategies that suppress the effects of noise while still allowing for a coherent exchange of excitations between the individual subsystems. The corresponding pulse sequences can be further designed to realize either Jaynes-Cummings, anti-Jaynes-Cummings, or Rabi couplings, as well as different types of cavity-mediated interactions between the two-level systems. A detailed analysis of the residual imperfections demonstrates that this decoupling strategy can boost the effective cooperativity of the cavity QED system by several orders of magnitude and improve the fidelity of quantum-technologically relevant operations accordingly.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Thermalization in Finite Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization is the process through which a physical system evolves toward a state of thermal equilibrium. Determining whether or not a physical system will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the Gibbs expectation value is PSPACE-complete. We also show that the related problem of determining whether the system thermalizes to the microcanonical expectation value is contained in PSPACE and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. In light of recent results demonstrating undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.</description>

      <title>An exact Markovian decoherence dynamics of two interacting harmonic oscillators coupled to a bosonic heat bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution of the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation in a precise Markovian limit for a system of two harmonically coupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a common thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. The thermal bath is initially considered to be at arbitrary temperatures and characterized by an Ohmic Lorentz-Drude spectral density. In the examined system, couplings between the two harmonic oscillators and the environment ensure a complete decoupling of the center-of-mass and relative degrees of freedom, resulting in undamped dynamics in the relative coordinate. The exact time evolution is used to analyze the system's entanglement dynamics, quantified through logarithmic negativity and quantum mutual information, while ensuring the positivity of the density operator to confirm the physical validity of the results. We demonstrate that, under certain parameter regimes and initial conditions, the asymptotic dynamics can give rise to periodic entanglement-disentanglement behavior. Furthermore, numerical simulations reveal that for negative values of the direct coupling between the oscillators, which are sufficiently close to a critical lower bound beyond which the system becomes unstable, the system can maintain entanglement across a broad temperature range and for arbitrarily long durations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Fixed-Radius Neighbor Search</title>

Abstract: Neighbor search is a computationally demanding problem, usually both time- and memory-consuming. The main problem of this kind of algorithms is the long execution time due to cache misses. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the Fixed RAdius Neighbor Search problem (FRANS) based on the fixed-point version of Grover's algorithm. We propose an efficient circuit for solving the FRANS with linear query complexity with the number of particles $N$. The quantum circuit returns the list of all the neighbors' pairs within the fixed radius, together with their distance, avoiding the slow down given by cache miss.
  We analyzed the gate and the query complexity of the circuit. Our FRANS algorithm presents a query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N/\sqrt{M})$, where $M$ is the number of solutions, reaching the optimal lower bound of the Grover's algorithm. We propose different implementations of the oracle, which must be chosen depending on the precise structure of the database. Among these, we present an implementation using the Chebyshev distance with depth $\mathcal{O}(q_1)$, where $2^{q_1}$ is the number of grid points used to discretize a spatial dimension. State-of-the-art algorithms for state preparation allow for a trade-off between depth and width of the circuit, with a volume (depth$\times$ width) of $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$. This unfavorable scaling can be brought down to $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log N))$ in case of structured datasets. We proposed a stopping criterion based on Bayes interference and tested its validity on $1D$ simulations. Finally, we accounted for the readout complexity and assessed the resilience of the model to the readout error, suggesting an error correction-free strategy to check the accuracy of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistics of local measurements of joint quantum systems can sometimes be used to distinguish the spatiotemporal structure in which they were measured. We first prove that every bipartite separable density matrix is temporally compatible with direct causal influence for arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum systems and measurements of a tomographically-complete class of observables, which includes all Pauli observables in the case of multi-qubit systems. Equivalently, if a bipartite density matrix is not temporally compatible with direct causal influence, then it must be entangled. We also provide an operational meaning for the two temporal evolutions consistent with such correlations in terms of generalized dephasing channels and pretty good measurements. The two temporal evolutions are Bayesian inverses of each other, which is different from them being Petz recovery maps of each other. Finally, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary bipartite quantum state to be temporally compatible, thereby providing a temporal analogue of the positive partial transpose criterion valid for quantum systems of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of generalized squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing Hamiltonians corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonreciprocal Noise Transfer under Onsager-Casimir Symmetry in Synthetic-Field Optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optomechanical system of fundamental importance consists of two intercoupled mechanical resonators, which are radiation-pressure coupled individually to a photonic cavity. This closed-loop and overall lossy configuration possesses two exceptional points (EPs) and offers the realization of synthetic magnetism, controlled by the loop phase. To elucidate the intricate role of loop phase and EPs in this setting, we analyze the noise power spectral density profiles of internal as well as output fluctuations. In the presence of a synthetic magnetic field, the nonreciprocal routing of a signal is well known. Here, we further show that this also applies to nonreciprocal backaction noise flow when the time-reversal symmetry is broken, while the Onsager-Casimir symmetry still holds. To better quantify this phenomenon, we introduce a nonreciprocity measure that contrasts the time-reversed counterparts as a function of loop phase. We observe that nonreciprocal noise flow is enhanced for smaller intermechanical couplings at the expense of lower sensitivity, whereas for sensing purposes, using a higher intermechanical coupling constant is the more viable option.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a nonperturbative macroscopic QED model that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors was built. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The nonresonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay of non-Hermitian topological phases under point- and line-gap conditions. Using natural homomorphisms from line-gap to point-gap phases, we distinguish extrinsic phases, reducible to Hermitian or anti-Hermitian line-gapped phases, from intrinsic phases, which are genuinely non-Hermitian without Hermitian counterparts. Although classification tables for all symmetry classes were already presented in earlier work, the present paper develops a unified formulation and provides explicit computations for all internal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sum Capacity via Quantum and No-Signaling Cooperation Between Transmitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a communication scenario over a discrete memoryless interference channel or multiple access channel without feedback, where transmitters exploit classical, quantum, or no-signaling cooperation. In this scenario, several previous works have shown that the sum capacities of channels involving pseudo-telepathy games can be enhanced by quantum or no-signaling cooperation. However, a full characterization of which channels admit such an improvement remains open. By focusing on the common characteristics of previously studied channels, we propose a broader class of channels for which quantum or no-signaling cooperation increases the sum capacity. Channels in this class are associated with a pseudo-telepathy game, with channel inputs specified as tuples of questions and answers from the game. In addition, when the channel inputs satisfy the winning condition of the game, the channel decomposes into parallel weakly symmetric sub-channels and is less noisy compared to the case when the inputs do not meet the winning condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximizing the computational utility of near-term quantum processors requires predictive noise models that inform robust, noise-aware compilation and error mitigation. Conventional models often fail to capture the complex error dynamics of real hardware or require prohibitive characterization overhead. We introduce a data-efficient framework that first constructs a physically motivated, parameterized noise model, and subsequently employs machine learning-driven Bayesian optimization to identify its parameters. Our approach circumvents costly characterization protocols by estimating algorithm- and hardware-specific error parameters directly from readily available experimental data derived from existing application and benchmark circuit executions. The generality and robustness of the framework are demonstrated across diverse algorithms and superconducting devices, yielding high-fidelity predictions by estimating an independent parameter set tailored to each specific algorithm-hardware context. Crucially, we show that a model calibrated exclusively on small-scale circuits accurately predicts the behavior of larger validation circuits. Our data-efficient approach achieves up to a 65% improvement in model fidelity quantified by the Hellinger distance between predicted and experimental circuit output distributions, compared to standard noise models derived from device properties. This work establishes a practical paradigm for application-aware noise characterization, enabling compilation and error-mitigation strategies tailored to the specific interplay between quantum algorithms and device-specific noise dynamics.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Heuristics for the Binary Paint Shop Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) is an $\mathsf{APX}$-hard optimisation problem in automotive manufacturing: given a sequence of $2n$ cars, comprising $n$ distinct models each appearing twice, the task is to decide which of two colours to paint each car so that the two occurrences of each model are painted differently, while minimising consecutive colour swaps. The key performance metric is the paint swap ratio, the average number of colour changes per car, which directly impacts production efficiency and cost. Prior work showed that the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) at depth $p=7$ achieves a paint swap ratio of $0.393$, outperforming the classical Recursive Greedy (RG) heuristic with an expected ratio of $0.4$ [Phys. Rev. A 104, 012403 (2021)]. More recently, the classical Recursive Star Greedy (RSG) heuristic was conjectured to achieve an expected ratio of $0.361$. In this study, we develop the theoretical foundations for applying QAOA to BPSP through a reduction of BPSP to weighted MaxCut, and use this framework to benchmark two state-of-the-art low-depth QAOA variants, eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA) and Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), at $p=1$ (denoted XQAOA$_1$ and RQAOA$_1$), against the strongest classical heuristics known to date. Across instances ranging from $2^7$ to $2^{12}$ cars, XQAOA$_1$ achieves an average ratio of $0.357$, surpassing RQAOA$_1$ and all classical heuristics, including the conjectured performance of RSG. Surprisingly, RQAOA$_1$ shows diminishing performance as size increases: despite using provably optimal QAOA$_1$ parameters at each recursion, it is outperformed by RSG on most $2^{11}$-car instances and all $2^{12}$-car instances. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report RQAOA$_1$'s performance degradation at scale. In contrast, XQAOA$_1$ remains robust, indicating strong potential to asymptotically surpass all known heuristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor-network (TN) methods have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can suppress substantial portions of the entanglement structure, effectively alleviating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Vanishing of the Success Probability in Shor's Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -&gt; infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N &lt;= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</description>

      <title>On the modeling of irreversibility by relaxator Liouville dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general approach to modeling irreversibility starting from microscopic reversibility is presented. The time $t_s$ up to which relevant degrees of freedom of a system are tracked is extremely much shorter than the spectral resolution time $t_e$ that would be necessary to resolve the spectrum of all degrees of freedom involved. A relaxator that breaks reversibility condenses in the Liouville operator of the relevant degrees of freedom. The irrelevant degrees of freedom act as an environment to the system. The irreversible relaxator Liouville equation contains memory effects and initial correlations of all degrees of freedom. Stationary states turn out to be generically unique and independent of the initial conditions and exceptions are due to degeneracies. Equilibrium states lie in the relaxator's kernel yielding a stationary Pauli master equation. Kinetic equations for oneparticle densities are constructed as special cases of relaxator Liouville dynamics. Kubo's linear response theory is generalized to relaxator Liouville dynamics and related to irreversibility within the system. In a weak coupling approximation between system and environment the relaxator can be reduced to environmental correlations and bilinear system operators. Markov approximation turns the relaxator Liouville dynamics into a semi-group dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched N\'eel state from R\'enyi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental R\'enyi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and R\'enyi relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Implementing Grover Algorithm on Quantum Chip Architecture Optimized with QGHNN for Fidelity and Entanglement Preservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Which-crystal information and wave-particle duality in induced-coherence interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an operational reinterpretation of wave-particle complementarity in the low-gain Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) induced-coherence interferometer. In the low gain limit, each photon pair is emitted by either one of two nonlinear crystals. Preparing nonorthogonal conditional idler states that encode which-crystal information. While previous studies inferred distinguishability indirectly from signal visibility with undetected idler photons. We show that the idler states naturally define a binary quantum hypothesis-testing problem. By performing optimal measurements on the idler, we analyze this task using both zero-error measurement unambiguous discrimination (Ivanovic-Dieks-Peres (IDP)) and minimum-error discrimination (Helstrom bound). We show that the signal visibility equals the optimal inconclusive probability of unambiguous discrimination. The Helstrom bound gives the optimal probability of identifying the emitting crystal. While signal visibility is an ensemble-averaged expectation value, the IDP and Helstrom strategies correspond to optimal single-photon decision measurements on the idler. The decision problem concerns inferring a past source event from a present measurement outcome This establishes wave-particle duality in induced coherence as a manifestation of optimal quantum decision strategies rather than a purely geometric constraint. We further extend the analysis to the presence of thermal photons introduced in the object arm, which render the conditional idler states mixed. In this case, both the visibility and the achievable distinguishability are reduced, reflecting the fundamental limitations imposed by mixed-state discrimination. The approach is model-independent and applies to general two-path interferometers with markers.</description>

Abstract: Vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theory impose fundamental limitations on our ability to measure time in short scales. To investigate the impact of universal quantum field theory effects on observer-dependent time measurements, we introduce a clock model based on the vacuum decay probability of a finite-sized quantum system. Using this model, we study a microscopic twin paradox scenario and find that, in the smallest scales, time is not only dependent on the trajectory connecting two events, but also on how vacuum fluctuations interact with the microscopic details of the clocks.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Quantum Codes Beyond the Pauli Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typical stabilizer codes aim to solve the general problem of fault-tolerance without regard for the structure of a specific system. By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems.</description>

Abstract: Device-independent quantum secret sharing (DI-QSS) provides security against untrusted quantum devices. While device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) using Mermin-Peres magic square game [Zhen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett, 2023] has been proposed, we present the first DI-QSS protocol based on a pseudo-telepathy parity game without requiring dedicated rounds and specific basis configuration, unlike CHSH-based DI-QSS schemes [Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. A, 2024]. Our scheme simultaneously certifies device-independence and key generation using a single test, achieving optimal performance for a seven-qubit GHZ state configuration. Security against collective attacks is analyzed, and a positive key rate is obtained under white noise and photon loss. Moreover, we show a bitwise advantage over the previous protocol for producing the same raw key length.</description>

      <title>Any DOF All at Once: Single Photon State Tomography in a Single Measurement Setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies utilize various degrees of freedom (DOFs) of light, such as polarization, frequency, and spatial modes, to encode quantum information. In the effort of further improving channel capacity and increasing the complexity of available quantum operations, high-dimensional and hyperentangled states are now gaining interest. Efficiently measuring these high dimensional states is challenging due to the large number of measurements required for reconstructing the full density matrix via quantum state tomography (QST), and the fact that each measurement requires some modification in the experimental setup. Here, we propose a framework for reconstructing the density matrix of a single-photon hyperentangled across multiple DOFs using a single intensity-measurement obtainable from traditional cameras, and discuss extensions for multiphoton hyperentangled states. Our method hinges on the spatial DOF of the photon and uses it to encode information from other DOFs. We numerically demonstrate this method for single-photon OAM-spin and OAM-frequency entangled states using an ideal coupler and a multimode fiber, to perform the spatial information mixing and encoding. This technique simplifies the experimental setup and reduces acquisition time compared to traditional QST based methods. Moreover, it allows recovery of DOFs that conventional cameras cannot detect, such as polarization, thus eliminating the need for projection measurements.</description>

      <title>Controlling Nonadiabatic Transitions Through Engineered Ultrafast Laser Fields at Conical Intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate coherent control of nonadiabatic dynamics at a conical intersection (CI) using engineered ultrafast laser pulses. Within a model vibronic system, we tailor pulse chirp and temporal profile and compute the resulting wave-packet population and coherence dynamics using projections along the reaction coordinate. This approach allows us to resolve the detailed evolution of wave-packets as they traverse the degeneracy region with strong nonadiabatic coupling. By systematically varying pulse parameters, we demonstrate that both chirp and pulse duration modulate vibrational coherence and alter branching between competing pathways, leading to controlled changes in quantum yield. Our results elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying pulse-shaped control near conical intersections and establish a general framework for manipulating ultrafast nonadiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional derivative-free optimization. A case study on minimization of Hartree-Fock-Roothaan energy functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an evaluation of derivative-free optimization algorithms for the direct minimization of Hartree-Fock-Roothaan energy functionals involving nonlinear orbital parameters and quantum numbers with noninteger order. The analysis focuses on atomic calculations employing noninteger Slater-type orbitals. Analytic derivatives of the energy functional are not readily available for these orbitals. Four methods are investigated under identical numerical conditions: Powell's conjugate-direction method, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, coordinate-based pattern search, and a model-based algorithm utilizing radial basis functions for surrogate-model construction. Performance benchmarking is first performed using the Powell singular function, a well-established test case exhibiting challenging properties including Hessian singularity at the global minimum. The algorithms are then applied to Hartree-Fock-Roothaan self-consistent-field energy functionals, which define a highly non-convex optimization landscape due to the nonlinear coupling of orbital parameters. Illustrative examples are provided for closed$-$shell atomic configurations, specifically the He, Be isoelectronic series, with calculations performed for energy functionals involving up to eight nonlinear parameters. This work presents the first systematic investigation of derivative-free optimization methods for Hartree-Fock$-$Roothaan energy minimization with non-integer Slater orbitals.</description>

      <title>Beyond trace class -- Tensor products of Hilbert spaces and operator ideals in quantum physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04627v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the meaning of the conjugate of a complex Hilbert space, including a related application of the theorem of Fr\'{e}chet-Riesz (by which an analysis of semilinear operators can be reduced to - linear - operator theory) to a revisit of applications of nuclear and absolutely $p$-summing operators in algebraic quantum field theory in the sense of Araki, Haag and Kastler ($p=2$) and more recently in the framework of general probabilistic spaces ($p=1$), we will outline that Banach operator ideals in the sense of Pietsch, or equivalently tensor products of Banach spaces in the sense of Grothendieck are even lurking in the foundations and philosophy of quantum physics and quantum information theory. In particular, we concentrate on their importance in algebraic quantum field theory. In doing so, we establish a canonical isometric isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces $H\otimes_2 (K \otimes_2 L)$ and $(H \otimes_2 K) \otimes_2 L$ (Theorem 3.8) and revisit the role of trace class operators.
  A few applications are specified, including the appropriateness of the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an implied Banach operator ideal representation of the tensor product of two complex Hilbert spaces $H \otimes_2 K$ (Proposition 3.4) and a purely linear algebraic description of the quantum teleportation process (Example 3.10).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the energy levels of free parafermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a parent Hermitian tight-binding model on a bipartite lattice with chiral symmetry, we theoretically generate non-Hermitian models for free fermions with $p$ orbitals per unit cell satisfying a complex generalization of chiral symmetry. The $p$ complex energy bands in $k$ space are given by a common $k$-dependent real factor, determined by the bands of the parent model, multiplied by the $p$th roots of unity. When the parent model is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the single-particle energy levels are the same as those of free parafermion solutions to Baxter's non-Hermitian clock model. This construction relies on fully unidirectional hopping to create Bloch Hamiltonians with the form of generalized permutation matrices, but we also describe the effect of partial unidirectional hopping. For fully bidirectional hopping, the Bloch Hamiltonians are Hermitian and may be separated into even and odd parity blocks with respect to inversion of the orbitals within the unit cell. Partially unidirectional hopping breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes the even and odd blocks, and the real energy spectrum evolves into a complex one as the degree of unidirectionality increases, with details determined by the topology of the parent model and the number of orbitals per unit cell, $p$. We describe this process in detail for $p=3$ and $p=4$ with the SSH model. We also apply our approach to graphene, and show that $AA$-stacked bilayer graphene evolves into a square root Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene with the introduction of unidirectional hopping. We show that higher-order exceptional points occur at edge states and solitons in the non-Hermitian SSH model, and at the Dirac point of non-Hermitian graphene.</description>

      <title>Multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC): a quantum-inspired, state-averaged approach to ground- and excited-state energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC) method, a quantum-inspired algorithm that runs efficiently on classical hardware and is designed to predict both ground and excited electronic states of molecules. Accurate excited-state energetics are essential for interpreting spectroscopy and chemical reactivity, but standard electronic structure methods are either too computationally expensive for larger systems or lose reliability in the presence of strong electron correlation. MS-iQCC addresses this challenge by simultaneously optimizing multiple electronic states in a single, state-averaged procedure that treats ground and excited states on equal footing. This removes the energetic bias that is introduced when excited states are computed one at a time and constrained to remain orthogonal to previously optimized states. The approach supports multireference electronic structure by allowing multideterminantal initial guesses and by adaptively building a compact exponential ansatz from a pool of qubit excitation generators. We apply MS-iQCC to H$_4$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and C$_2$, including strongly correlated geometries, and observe robust convergence of all targeted state energies to chemically meaningful accuracy across their potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>
