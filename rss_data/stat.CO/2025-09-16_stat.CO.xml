      <title>Generalized promotion time cure model: A new modeling framework to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve survival prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting the interplay between the cancer cells and the associated tumor microenvironment, and the produced high-dimensional omics data should also augment existing survival modeling approaches for identifying tumor cell type-specific genes predictive of cancer patient survival. However, there is no statistical model to integrate multiscale data including individual-level survival data, multicellular-level cell composition data and cellular-level single-cell omics covariates. We propose a class of Bayesian generalized promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) for the multiscale data integration to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve cancer prognosis. We demonstrate with simulations in both low- and high-dimensional settings that the proposed Bayesian GPTCMs are able to identify cell-type-associated covariates and improve survival prediction.</description>

      <title>Inferring Soil Drydown Behaviour with Adaptive Bayesian Online Changepoint Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous soil-moisture measurements provide a direct lens on subsurface hydrological processes, notably the post-rainfall "drydown" phase. Because these records consist of distinct, segment-specific behaviours whose forms and scales vary over time, realistic inference demands a model that captures piecewise dynamics while accommodating parameters that are unknown a priori. Building on Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD), we introduce two complementary extensions: a particle-filter variant that substitutes exact marginalisation with sequential Monte Carlo to enable real-time inference when critical parameters cannot be integrated out analytically, and an online-gradient variant that embeds stochastic gradient updates within BOCPD to learn application-relevant parameters on the fly without prohibitive computational cost. After validating both algorithms on synthetic data that replicate the temporal structure of field observations-detailing hyperparameter choices, priors, and cost-saving strategies-we apply them to soil-moisture series from experimental sites in Austria and the United States, quantifying site-specific drydown rates and demonstrating the advantages of our adaptive framework over static models.</description>

      <title>Tuning Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers via Greedy Incremental Divergence Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15704v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers heavily depends on the tuning of the Markov kernels used in the path proposal. For SMC samplers with unadjusted Markov kernels, standard tuning objectives, such as the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance rate or the expected-squared jump distance, are no longer applicable. While stochastic gradient-based end-to-end optimization has been explored for tuning SMC samplers, they often incur excessive training costs, even for tuning just the kernel step sizes. In this work, we propose a general adaptation framework for tuning the Markov kernels in SMC samplers by minimizing the incremental Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the proposal and target paths. For step size tuning, we provide a gradient- and tuning-free algorithm that is generally applicable for kernels such as Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by providing a tailored scheme for tuning kinetic LMC used in SMC samplers. Our implementations are able to obtain a full schedule of tuned parameters at the cost of a few vanilla SMC runs, which is a fraction of gradient-based approaches.</description>

      <title>A Particle-Flow Algorithm for Free-Support Wasserstein Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter extends the Euclidean mean to the space of probability measures by minimizing the weighted sum of squared 2-Wasserstein distances. We develop a free-support algorithm for computing Wasserstein barycenters that avoids entropic regularization and instead follows the formal Riemannian geometry of Wasserstein space. In our approach, barycenter atoms evolve as particles advected by averaged optimal-transport displacements, with barycentric projections of optimal transport plans used in place of Monge maps when the latter do not exist. This yields a geometry-aware particle-flow update that preserves sharp features of the Wasserstein barycenter while remaining computationally tractable. We establish theoretical guarantees, including consistency of barycentric projections, monotone descent and convergence to stationary points, stability with respect to perturbations of the inputs, and resolution consistency as the number of atoms increases. Empirical studies on averaging probability distributions, Bayesian posterior aggregation, image prototypes and classification, and large-scale clustering demonstrate accuracy and scalability of the proposed particle-flow approach, positioning it as a principled alternative to both linear programming and regularized solvers.</description>
