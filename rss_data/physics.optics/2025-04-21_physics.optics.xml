      <title>Understanding the Optical Theorem of Scattering: Scattering Surface Area against Scattering Cross Section, an Example with Ellipsoidal Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose using the scattering surface area rather than the scattering cross section to characterize the scattering behavior of ellipsoidal rigid bodies. We examined the scattering behavior of ellipsoidal rigid bodies, focusing on the relationship between their surface area and total scattering cross-section. Building on the foundational work of Carson Flammer, we utilize the spheroidal coordinate system to derive solutions for both prolate and oblate spheroids. Our analysis reveals that under the long-wavelength approximation, the total scattering cross-section is equivalent to the surface area of the ellipsoid, a relationship that holds true for both small and moderate eccentricities. This finding extends the established optical theorem, previously validated for spherical bodies, to more complex geometries.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Phase Control of an Optical Lattice with up to 50 dB Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optical lattice is a periodic light crystal constructed from the standing-wave interference patterns of laser beams. It can be used to store and manipulate quantum degenerate atoms and is an ideal platform for the quantum simulation of many-body physics. A principal feature is that optical lattices are flexible and possess a variety of multidimensional geometries with modifiable band-structure. An even richer landscape emerges when control functions can be applied to the lattice by modulating the position or amplitude with Floquet driving. However, the desire for realizing high-modulation bandwidths while preserving extreme lattice stability has been difficult to achieve. In this paper, we demonstrate an effective solution that consists of overlapping two counterpropagating lattice beams and controlling the phase and intensity of each with independent acousto-optic modulators. Our phase controller mixes sampled light from both lattice beams with a common optical reference. This dual heterodyne locking method allows exquisite determination of the lattice position, while also removing parasitic phase noise accrued as the beams travel along separate paths. We report up to 50dB suppression in lattice phase noise in the 0.1Hz - 1Hz band along with significant suppression spanning more than four decades of frequency. When integrated, the absolute phase diffusion of the lattice position is only 10\r{A} over 10 s. This method permits precise, high-bandwidth modulation (above 50kHz) of the optical lattice intensity and phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by executing intricate time-varying phase profiles for atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>A Multisensory Approach to Probing Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive detection of objects embedded inside an optically scattering medium is essential for numerous applications in engineering and sciences. However, in most applications light at visible or near-infrared wavebands is scattered by the medium resulting in the obscuration of the embedded objects. Existing methods to overcome scattering generally rely on point-by-point scanning strategies, which limit spatial sampling density. In this work, we address the sampling limitations by drawing inspiration from multisensory integration mechanisms observed in nature, wherein distinct sensing modalities work together to enhance the perception of the surroundings. Our multisensory approach leverages the unique advantages of coherent light by combining the sensitivity of an interferometric LiDAR with a wide field neuromorphic sensor to probe objects inside a densely scattering medium. The neuromorphic camera provides wide field spatial cues of the embedded object, by monitoring the fluctuations in the speckle patterns produced by tuning the laser frequency. These spatial cues are used to guide a point-scanning FMCW LiDAR to retrieve high-resolution images. Using this approach, we imaged objects embedded within an 8 cm thick (&gt;100 transport mean free paths), tissue-like scattering medium with a 10x improvement in sampling density compared to traditional uniform sampling.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroad resonance of localized plasmon on a nanoparticle coupled with surface plasmon on a nanowire enabling two-photon excited emission via continuous-wave laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study found that plasmonic hotspots (HSs) between silver nanoparticles (NPs) and silver nanowires (NWs) generated two-photon excited emissions, including hyper-Rayleigh, hyper-Raman, and two-photon fluorescence of dye molecules with continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation. A comparison between experimental results and electromagnetic (EM) calculations revealed that a large EM enhancement factor (FR) at the HS appears in the visible to NIR regions owing to EM coupling between localized plasmons of the NP and surface plasmons of the NW. This ultrabroad resonance of the coupled plasmons enables the observation of two-photon-excited emissions with CW laser excitation. A comparison of the dependence of the NP diameter, NW diameter, and gap distance on two-photon-excited emissions further demonstrated that the large HS-by-HS variations in the emission intensities were mainly induced by the sensitivity of FR to the gap distance at the HSs. We also experimentally and theoretically investigated the propagation of two-photon-excited emission light to a neighboring NP on the NW via surface plasmons.</description>

      <title>Laser power stabilization using conservation law in acoustic optical modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An active method of laser power stabilization is realized utilizing an acoustic optical modulator (AOM). Under Bragg diffraction conditions, the total output power of AOM equals the combined power of the 0th and 1st order beams, which are expressed as the sum of the sampling beam power and a temperature-sensitive term. Based on this conservation law, we designed a digital PID control system that dynamically adjusts the 1st order beam power to maintain a stable output of the 0th order application beam. The method allows high availability and deep engagement of the application beam. Experimental result demonstrates that the relative power noise of controlled application beam is reduced by a factor of 200, reaching $4 \times 10^{-6} $ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 0.0001 Hz compared with the uncontrolled total power. Allan deviation shows that the application beam reaches a relative power instability of 3.28$\times 10^{-6}$ at 500 s averaging time. This active digital control method of laser power in long term can be used for applications requiring ultra-stable laser sources, such as the atomic clocks, interferometers and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Scalable multilayer diffractive neural network with all-optical nonlinear activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical diffractive neural networks (DNNs) offer a promising alternative to electronics-based neural network processing due to their low latency, high throughput, and inherent spatial parallelism. However, the lack of reconfigurability and nonlinearity limits existing all-optical DNNs to handling only simple tasks. In this study, we present a folded optical system that enables a multilayer reconfigurable DNN using a single spatial light modulator. This platform not only enables dynamic weight reconfiguration for diverse classification challenges but crucially integrates a mirror-coated silicon substrate exhibiting instantaneous \c{hi}(3) nonlinearity. The incorporation of all-optical nonlinear activation yields substantial accuracy improvements across benchmark tasks, with performance gains becoming increasingly significant as both network depth and task complexity escalate. Our system represents a critical advancement toward realizing scalable all-optical neural networks with complex architectures, potentially achieving computational capabilities that rival their electronic counterparts while maintaining photonic advantages.</description>

      <title>Integrated tunable green light source on silicon nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated green light sources are essential for telecommunications and quantum applications, while the performance of current on-chip green light generation is still limited in power and tunability. In this work, we demonstrate green light generation in silicon nitride microresonators using photo-induced second-order nonlinearities, achieving up to 3.5 mW green power via second-harmonic generation and densely tunable over a 29 nm range. In addition, we report milliwatt-level all-optical poling (AOP) threshold, allowing for amplifier-free continuous-wave AOP. Furthermore, we demonstrate non-cascaded sum-frequency generation, leveraging the combination of AOP and simultaneous coherent frequency combs generation at 1 $\mu$m. Such comb-assisted AOP enables switching of the green light generation over an 11 nm range while maintaining the pump within a single resonance. The combination of such highly efficient photo-induced nonlinearity and multi-wavelength AOP enables the realization of low-threshold, high-power, widely-tunable on-chip green sources.</description>

      <title>Narrow light beams with linear polarization in a Kerr medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the curl-curl type vector equation describing a monochromatic light wave in a focusing Kerr medium, the transverse structure of extremely narrow, linearly polarized self-focused optical beams is found numerically with a high accuracy. For such two-dimensional spatial solitons with their width as just about one wavelength, all the three components of electric field are essential. Since the solitons are ``saddle points'' of some functional, the numerical method used here is a relaxation procedure, with the functional being minimized on stable modes, and maximized on almost all unstable modes. The only remaining unstable mode of common amplitude is stabilized by fixing the energy flux across the beam cross-section.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Coherent Optical Nonlinearities of a Macroscopic Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical responses of solids are typically understood to be local in space. Whether locality holds for the optical response of a macroscopic quantum system has, however, been largely unexplored. Here, we use multidimensional coherent spectroscopy at the optical diffraction limit to demonstrate nonlocal optical nonlinearities in a semiconductor microcavity. These nonlocal optical responses are both coherent and quantum in nature, deriving from the macroscopic length scale of confined exciton-polariton wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum optics and optical coherence in high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical coherence encodes information about the correlations of the electromagnetic field. In combination with quantum optical approaches, it allows for the study of the correlations between photons. Since the pioneering papers of Glauber, studies of optical coherence have facilitated many fundamental insights into non-classical signatures of light emission processes, with wide applicability in modern quantum technologies. However, when it comes to the photon up-conversion process of high-order harmonic generation the description has focused on semi-classical methods for decades. In this work, we overcome this limitation and establish a quantum optical theory of field correlations for the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). In effect, we introduce the notion of optical coherence at the intersection of quantum optics and strong laser-driven processes, and obtain the harmonic field correlation functions. In particular, we focus on the first and second order field correlation, which allow to understand the origin of the classical properties of the HHG spectrum, and its departure into the quantum regime. Further, we develop the theory for two-time intensity correlation functions of the harmonic field, and demonstrate the onset of anti-bunching signatures in HHG. We study the correlation functions in the regime of a single, few and many emitters in atomic HHG, showing the transition from quantum to classical signatures in the correlations. Since the theory is generic, it can be extended to multi-time correlation functions of any order, and allows to consider the interaction of light with arbitrary material systems.</description>

      <title>Role of the Direct-to-Indirect Bandgap Crossover in the 'Reverse' Energy Transfer Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, a 'reverse' ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report a reverse ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to higher bandgap WS2, due to the near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct-to-indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evident by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. We also find that, at 300 K the estimated ET timescale of around 45 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K+ to K-) time and comparable with the interlayer charge transfer time.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial two-sphere Newton's cradle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locally resonant metamaterials are among the most studied types of elastic/acoustic metamaterials, with significant research focused on wave propagation in a continuum of "meta-atoms" Here we investigate the collision dynamics of two identical pendulum-suspended mass-in-mass resonators, essentially a two-sphere Newton's cradle, emphasizing the readily realizable scenario where the internal resonator frequency is much greater than the pendulum frequency. We first show that the dynamics of a collision can be described using effective parameters, similar to how previous metamaterials research has characterized wave propagation through effective material properties. Non-conventional collision dynamics -- observed in two colliding mass-in-mass systems where one is initially at rest -- include behaviors such as the moving sphere rebounding as if from a fixed wall while the other remains essentially stationary, the spheres coupling and moving forward in near-unison, and the spheres recoiling in opposite directions. These responses can be achieved by tuning the effective parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters can take on values that differ significantly from those in a conventional Newton's cradle. Additionally, we investigate multiple collisions of the two spheres, revealing complex dynamics. This work paves the way for the development and study of new "collision-based metamaterial" structures.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced quantum nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13437v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a visible light communication (VLC) system that employs a colored reconfigurable intelligent surface (CRIS) based on dichroic mirrors that reflect light at tunable frequencies. A verifier can use the CRIS to authenticate transmissions by comparing received multicolor power profiles with expected patterns. Four CRIS configuration strategies are evaluated: a deterministic cyclic pattern, static random reflectance, dynamic random reflectance, and dynamic random permutation of fixed profiles. Randomized configurations, especially dynamic ones, achieve superior authentication, enabling a novel challenge-response physical-layer authentication scheme over CRIS.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>

Abstract: Scintillators convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons and play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films because of the localized nature of this effect. This study introduces a method to expand the application of nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-sized plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) folds for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_{3}$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 $\pm$ 0.31) and (3.02 $\pm$ 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate a (2.07 $\pm$ 0.39) fold increase in light yield under $^{241}$Am $\gamma$-excitation. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Higher-Order Exceptional Points via Non-Hermitian Zero-Index Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) in optical structures enable ultra-sensitive responses to perturbations. However, previous investigations on higher-order EPs have predominantly focused on coupled systems, leaving their fundamental physics in open scattering systems largely unexplored. Here, we harness wave interference to realize higher-order EPs in non-Hermitian zero-index materials connected to multiple open channels. Specifically, we show that a three-channel model can give rise to three interesting types of third-order EPs: lasing EP, reflecting EP, and absorbing EP. Notably, near the third-order absorbing EP, we show ultrasensitivity -- a drastic change in output power in response to perturbations at the operating frequency -- in a purely lossy system. These findings pave the way for achieving higher-order and even arbitrary-order EPs in open scattering systems, offering significant potential for advanced sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>

Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <title>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11842</link>

Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality of gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the continuous quantum measurement of gravitational radiation. This is typically done by coupling the radiation to a meter, such as a resonant mass detector or an interferometer, which is subsequently read out by a detector. We find that the detector employed determines whether the gravitational field exhibits wave or particle characteristics. A linear detector, such as a homodyne detector, yields no signal for a field in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude of a field in a coherent state. Such a linear detector thus supports a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton, resulting in a quantum jump in energy equal to the energy of the absorbed graviton. Our results extend the principle of complementarity to quantized gravitational radiation, demonstrating the detector dependence of the graviton, and indicates that conceptually simple modifications to gravitational-wave detectors can make them graviton counters.</description>
