      <title>Graph products of residually finite monoids are residually finite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any graph product of residually finite monoids is residually finite. As a special case we obtain that any free product of residually finite monoids is residually finite. The corresponding results for graph products of semigroups follow.</description>

      <title>Multi-EGS-groups: exponent of congruence quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a multi-EGS-group $K$ acting on the $p$-adic rooted tree, where $p$ is any prime number, we compute the exponent of the congruence quotient $K_n= K/ \St_K(n)$ for all $n\ge 1$. The formula that we obtain for $\exp(K_n)$ only depends on $p$, $n$ and the periodicity of $K$.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walk is ballistic on graphs with more than one end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that on any transitive graph $G$ with infinitely many ends, a self-avoiding walk of length $n$ is ballistic with extremely high probability, in the sense that there exist constants $c,t&gt;0$ such that $\mathbb{P}_n(d_G(w_0,w_n)\geq cn)\geq 1-e^{-tn}$ for every $n\geq 1$. Furthermore, we show that the number of self-avoiding walks of length $n$ grows asymptotically like $\mu_w^n$, in the sense that there exists $C&gt;0$ such that $\mu_w^n\leq c_n\leq C\mu_w^n$ for every $n\geq 1$. Our results extend more generally to quasi-transitive graphs with infinitely many ends, satisfying the additional technical property that there is a quasi-transitive group of automorphisms of $G$ which does not fix an end of $G$.</description>

      <title>Maximal ideals of group C*-algebras and Thompson's groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a conditional expectation $P$ from a C*-algebra $B$ onto a C*-subalgebra $A$, we observe that induction of ideals via $P$, together with a map which we call co-induction, forms a Galois connection between the lattices of ideals of $A$ and $B$. Using properties of this Galois connection, we show that, given a discrete group $G$ and a stabilizer subgroup $G_x$ for the action of $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary, induction gives a bijection between the set of maximal co-induced ideals of $C^*(G_x)$ and the set of maximal ideals of $C^*_r(G)$. As an application, we prove that the reduced C*-algebra of Thompson's group $T$ has a unique maximal ideal. Furthermore, we show that, if Thompson's group $F$ is amenable, then $C^*_r(T)$ has infinitely many ideals.</description>

      <title>Topological and geometric restrictions on hyperconvex representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of hyperconvex representations of hyperbolic groups in ${\rm PSL}(d,\mathbb{C})$ and establish two structural results: a group admitting a hyperconvex representation is virtually isomorphic to a Kleinian group, and its hyperconvex limit set in the appropriate flag manifold has Hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than $2$.</description>

      <title>Subgroup induction property for branch groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.13310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subgroup induction property is a property of self-similar groups acting on rooted trees introduced by Grigorchuk and Wilson in 2003 that appears to have strong implications on the structure of the groups possessing it. It was for example used in the proof that the first Grigorchuk group as well as the Gupta-Sidki 3-group are subgroup separable (locally extended residually finite) or to describe their finitely generated subgroups as well as their weakly maximal subgroups. However, until now, there were only two known examples of groups with this property, namely the first Grigorchuk group and the Gupta-Sidki 3-group.
  The aim of this article is twofold. First, we investigate various consequences of the subgroup induction property for branch groups, a particularly interesting class of self-similar groups. Notably, we show that finitely generated branch groups with the subgroup induction property must be torsion, just infinite and subgroup separable, and we establish conditions under which all their maximal subgroups are of finite index and all their weakly maximal subgroups are closed in the profinite topology. Then, we show that every torsion GGS group has the subgroup induction property, hence providing the first infinite family of examples of groups with this property.</description>

      <title>On the diameter of intersection graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intersection graph $\Delta_G$ of a finite group $G$ is a simple graph with vertices the non-trivial proper subgroups of $G$, and an edge between two vertices if their corresponding subgroups intersect non-trivially. These graphs were introduced by Cs\'ak\'any and Poll\'ak in 1969. In this paper we answer two long-standing open questions posed by Cs\'ak\'any and Poll\'ak concerning the diameter of intersection graphs. We prove some necessary conditions for a non-simple group to have an intersection graph of diameter 4. We also construct the first examples of non-simple groups and alternating groups whose intersection graphs have diameter 4.</description>
