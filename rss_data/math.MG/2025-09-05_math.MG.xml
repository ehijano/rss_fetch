      <title>On stochastic forms of functional isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic interpretation of several functional isoperimetric inequalities within the class of $p$-concave functions, building on random models for such functions introduced by P. Pivovarov and J. Rebollo-Bueno. First, we establish a stochastic isoperimetric inequality for a functional extension of the classical quermassintegrals, which yields a Sobolev-type inequality in this random setting as a particular case. Motivated by the latter, we further show that Zhang's affine Sobolev inequality holds in expectation when dealing with these random models of $p$-concave functions. Finally, we confirm that our results recover both their geometric analogues and deterministic counterparts. As a consequence of the latter, we establish a generalization of Zhang's affine Sobolev inequality restricted to $p$-concave functions in the context of convex measures.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of double base expansions and binary shifts with a hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two real bases $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, a binary sequence $i_1 i_2 \cdots \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is the $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion of the number \[ \pi_{q_0,q_1}(i_1 i_2 \cdots) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i_k}{q_{i_1} \cdots q_{i_k}}. \] Let $U_{q_0,q_1}$ be the set of all real numbers having a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion. When the bases are equal, i.e., $q_0 = q_1 = q$, Allaart and Kong (2019) established the continuity in $q$ of the Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set $U_{q,q}$, building on the work of Komornik, Kong, and Li (2017). We derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of $U_{q_0,q_1}$ and the entropy of the underlying subshift for arbitrary $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, and prove the continuity of these quantities as functions of $(q_0, q_1)$. Our results also concern general dynamical systems described by binary shifts with a hole, including, in particular, the doubling map with a hole and (linear) Lorenz maps.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Flatness Factor over Unimodular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theta series of a lattice is a power series that characterizes the number of lattice vectors at certain norms. It is closely related to a critical quantity widely used in physical layer security and cryptography, known as the flatness factor, or equivalently, the smoothing parameter of a lattice. Both fields raise the fundamental question of determining the (globally) maximum theta series over a particular set of volume-one lattices, namely, the stable lattices. In this work, we present a property of unimodular lattices, a subfamily of stable lattices, to verify that the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ achieves the largest possible value of theta series over the set of unimodular lattices. This result advances the resolution of the open question, suggesting that any unimodular lattice, except those isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, has a strictly smaller theta series than that of $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. Our techniques are mainly based on studying the ratio of the theta series of a unimodular lattice to the theta series of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, called the theta series ratio. Consequently, all the findings concerning the theta series of a lattice extend to its flatness factor. Therefore, our results have applications to the Gaussian wiretap channel, the reverse Minkowski theorem, and lattice-based cryptography.</description>

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. As far as we know, these fundamental issues have not received much attention. We present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP. These conditions are related to the structure and the relative orientation of the boundaries of the subsets and to the norm. We also present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP. Our results significantly extend the horizon of a recent algorithm for solving the BAP problem [Censor, Mansour, Reem, J. Approx. Theory (2024)]. The paper also shows, perhaps for the first time, how wide is the scope of the BAP problem in terms of the scientific communities which are involved in it (frequently independently) and in terms of its applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Riemannian diffeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Riemannian diffeology. To this end, we use the tangent functor in the sense of Blohmann and one of the options of a metric on a diffeological space in the sense of Iglesias-Zemmour. As a consequence, the category consisting of weak Riemannian diffeological spaces and isometries is established. With a technical condition for a definite weak Riemannian metric, we show that the psudodistance induced by the metric is indeed a distance. As examples of weak Riemannian diffeological spaces, an adjunction space of manifolds, a space of smooth maps and the mixed one are considered.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs embedded in generic ways and realizing them as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with long-time interest of us, especially, the author, in realizing graphs as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions of certain nice classes.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the set consisting of all components of preimages of all single points and endowed with the quotient topology canonically. In tame cases, such objects are graphs. The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and homeomorphic to a closed interval. These graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry since theory of Morse functions has been established in the former half of the last century.
  We present a new answer to the problem, saying that generically embedded planar graphs are homeomorphic to the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions obtained by elementary polynomials and elementary procedures.</description>
