      <title>Data-Importance-Aware Power Allocation for Adaptive Real-Time Communication in Computer Vision Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life-transformative applications such as immersive extended reality are revolutionizing wireless communications and computer vision (CV). This paper presents a novel framework for importance-aware adaptive data transmissions, designed specifically for real-time CV applications where task-specific fidelity is critical. A novel importance-weighted mean square error (IMSE) metric is introduced as a task-oriented measure of reconstruction quality, considering sub-pixel-level importance (SP-I) and semantic segment-level importance (SS-I) models. To minimize IMSE under total power constraints, data-importance-aware waterfilling approaches are proposed to optimally allocate transmission power according to data importance and channel conditions, prioritizing sub-streams with high importance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform margin-adaptive waterfilling and equal power allocation strategies. The data partitioning that combines both SP-I and SS-I models is shown to achieve the most significant improvements, with normalized IMSE gains exceeding $7\,$dB and $10\,$dB over the baselines at high SNRs ($&gt;10\,$dB). These substantial gains highlight the potential of the proposed framework to enhance data efficiency and robustness in real-time CV applications, especially in bandwidth-limited and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Self-Supervised Time-Series Models for Transferable Diagnosis in Cross-Aircraft Type Bleed Air System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bleed Air System (BAS) is critical for maintaining flight safety and operational efficiency, supporting functions such as cabin pressurization, air conditioning, and engine anti-icing. However, BAS malfunctions, including overpressure, low pressure, and overheating, pose significant risks such as cabin depressurization, equipment failure, or engine damage. Current diagnostic approaches face notable limitations when applied across different aircraft types, particularly for newer models that lack sufficient operational data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a self-supervised learning-based foundation model that enables the transfer of diagnostic knowledge from mature aircraft (e.g., A320, A330) to newer ones (e.g., C919). Leveraging self-supervised pretraining, the model learns universal feature representations from flight signals without requiring labeled data, making it effective in data-scarce scenarios. This model enhances both anomaly detection and baseline signal prediction, thereby improving system reliability. The paper introduces a cross-model dataset, a self-supervised learning framework for BAS diagnostics, and a novel Joint Baseline and Anomaly Detection Loss Function tailored to real-world flight data. These innovations facilitate efficient transfer of diagnostic knowledge across aircraft types, ensuring robust support for early operational stages of new models. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between model capacity and transferability, providing a foundation for future research on large-scale flight signal models.</description>

      <title>Ray-Based Characterization of the AMPLE Model from 0.85 to 5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the adaptive multiple path loss exponent (AMPLE) radio propagation model under urban macrocell (UMa) and urban microcell (UMi) scenarios from 0.85-5 GHz using Ranplan Professional. We first enhance the original AMPLE model by introducing an additional frequency coefficient to support path loss prediction across multiple carrier frequencies. By using measurement-validated Ranplan Professional simulator, we simulate four cities and validate the simulations for further path loss model characterization. Specifically, we extract the close-in (CI) model parameters from the simulations and compare them with parameters extracted from measurements in other works. Under the ray-based model characterization, we compare the AMPLE model with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) path loss model, the CI model, the alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model, and those with simulation calibrations. In addition to standard performance metrics, we introduce the prediction-measurement difference error (PMDE) to assess overall prediction alignment with measurement, and mean simulation time per data point to evaluate model complexity. The results show that the AMPLE model outperforms existing models while maintaining similar model complexity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Multiuser Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in reconfigurable antennas have led to the new concept of the fluid antenna system (FAS) for shape and position flexibility, as another degree of freedom for wireless communication enhancement. This paper explores the integration of a transmit FAS array for hybrid beamforming (HBF) into a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication architecture for multiuser communications in the downlink, corresponding to the downlink RIS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) FAS model (Tx RIS-assisted-MISO-FAS). By considering Rician channel fading, we formulate a sum-rate maximization optimization problem to alternately optimize the HBF matrix, the RIS phase-shift matrix, and the FAS position. Due to the strong coupling of multiple optimization variables, the multi-fractional summation in the sum-rate expression, the modulus-1 limitation of analog phase shifters and RIS, and the antenna position variables appearing in the exponent, this problem is highly non-convex, which is addressed through the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework in conjunction with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. To reduce the computational complexity, we then propose a low-complexity grating-lobe (GL)-based telescopic-FAS (TFA) with multiple delicately deployed RISs under the sub-connected HBF architecture and the line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channel condition, to allow closed-form solutions for the HBF and TFA position. Our simulation results illustrate that the former optimization scheme significantly enhances the achievable rate of the proposed system, while the GL-based TFA scheme also provides a considerable gain over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems, requiring statistical channel state information (CSI) only and with low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Complexity-Scalable Near-Optimal Transceiver Design for Massive MIMO-BICM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are envisioned to employ multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions with large array sizes, and therefore, the adoption of complexity-scalable transceiver becomes important. In this paper, we propose a novel complexity-scalable transceiver design for MIMO systems exploiting bit-interleaved coded modulation (termed MIMO-BICM systems). The proposed scheme leverages the channel bidiagonalization decomposition (CBD), based on which an optimization framework for the precoder and post-processor is developed for maximizing the mutual information (MI) with finite-alphabet inputs. Particularly, we unveil that the desired precoder and post-processor behave distinctively with respect to the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), where the equivalent channel condition number (ECCN) serves as an effective indicator for the overall achievable rate performance. Specifically, at low SNRs, diagonal transmission with a large ECCN is advantageous, while at high SNRs, uniform subchannel gains with a small ECCN are preferred. This allows us to further propose a low-complexity generalized parallel CBD design (GP-CBD) based on Givens rotation according to a well-approximated closed-form performance metric on the achievable rates that takes into account the insights from the ECCN. Numerical results validate the superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms of achievable rate and bit error rate (BER), compared to state-of-the-art designs across various modulation and coding schemes (MCSs).</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for mmWave Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full potential of pinching-antenna systems (PAS) can be unblocked if pinching antennas can be accurately activated at positions tailored for the serving users', which means that acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at arbitrary positions along the waveguide is essential for the precise placement of antennas. In this work, we propose an innovative channel estimation scheme for millimeter-wave (mmWave) PAS. The proposed approach requires activating only a small number of pinching antennas, thereby limiting antenna switching and pilot overhead. Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with a waveguide selectively activates subarrays located near and far from the feed point, each comprising a small number of pinching antennas. This configuration effectively emulates a large-aperture array, enabling high-accuracy estimation of multipath propagation parameters, including angles, delays, and path gains. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate CSI estimation and data rates while effectively reducing hardware switching and pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Macroscale Molecular Communication in IoT-based Pipeline Inspection and Monitoring Applications: Preliminary Experiment and Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, pipeline networks serve as critical infrastructure for transporting materials such as water, gas, and oil. Modern technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor nodes, and inspection robots enable efficient pipeline monitoring and inspection. They can help detect and monitor various conditions and defects in pipelines such as cracks, corrosion, leakage, pressure, flow, and temperature. Since most pipelines are buried underground, wireless communication links suffer from significant attenuation and noise due to harsh environmental conditions. In such systems, communication links are required between the sensor nodes as well as between the external control/monitoring unit or sensor node and the inspection robot inside the pipeline. In this paper, we propose a macroscale molecular communication (MC) system in the IoT-based pipeline inspection and monitoring networks to address this challenge. We develop a mathematical model and implement a preliminary experimental testbed to validate the system and demonstrate its feasibility by transmitting and reconstructing binary sequences using volatile organic compound (VOC) as an information signal. We examined the impact of various system parameters including airflow carrier velocity, released VOC velocity, emission duration, and bit duration. Results indicate that these parameters significantly influence the received molecular signal, emphasizing the need for optimal configuration. This work serves as a preliminary step for further research on the application of MC in IoT-based pipeline inspection and monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Signal Detection with Unknown Bandwidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal detection in environments with unknown signal bandwidth and time intervals is a basic problem in adversarial and spectrum-sharing scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of detecting signals occupying unknown degrees of freedom from non-coherent power measurements where the signal is constrained to an interval in one dimension or hypercube in multiple dimensions. A Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is derived, resulting in a straightforward metric involving normalized average signal energy on each candidate signal set. We present bounds on false alarm and missed detection probabilities, demonstrating their dependence on signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and signal set sizes. To overcome the inherent computational complexity of exhaustive searches, we propose a computationally efficient binary search method, reducing the complexity from O(N2) to O(N) for one-dimensional cases. Simulations indicate that the method maintains performance near exhaustive searches and achieves asymptotic consistency, with interval-of-overlap converging to one under constant SNR as measurement size increases. The simulation studies also demonstrate superior performance and reduced complexity compared to contemporary neural network-based approaches, specifically outperforming custom-trained U-Net models in spectrum detection tasks.</description>

      <title>A New OTFS-Based Index Modulation System for 6G and Beyond: OTFS-Based Code Index Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the orthogonal time frequency space-based code index modulation (OTFS-CIM) scheme, a novel wireless communication system that combines OTFS modulation, which enhances error performance in high-mobility Rayleigh channels, with CIM technique, which improves spectral and energy efficiency, within a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) architecture. The proposed system is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations for various system parameters. Results show that increasing the modulation order degrades performance, while more receive antennas enhance it. Comparative analyses of error performance, throughput, spectral efficiency, and energy saving demonstrate that OTFS-CIM outperforms traditional OTFS and OTFS-based spatial modulation (OTFS-SM) systems. Also, the proposed OTFS-CIM system outperforms benchmark systems in many performance metrics under high-mobility scenarios, making it a strong candidate for sixth generation (6G) and beyond.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) Aided Media-Based Modulation System For 6G and Beyond Wireless Communications Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based index modulation system called OTFS-aided media-based modulation (MBM) scheme (OTFS-MBM), which is a promising technique for high-mobility wireless communication systems. The OTFS technique transforms information into the delay-Doppler domain, providing robustness against channel variations, while the MBM system utilizes controllable radio frequency (RF) mirrors to enhance spectral efficiency. The combination of these two techniques offers improved bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OTFS and OTFS-based spatial modulation (OTFS-SM) systems. The proposed system is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations over high-mobility Rayleigh channels for various system parameters. Comparative throughput, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency analyses are presented, and it is shown that OTFS-MBM outperforms traditional OTFS and OTFS-SM techniques. The proposed OTFS-MBM scheme stands out as a viable solution for sixth generation (6G) and next-generation wireless networks, enabling reliable communication in dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Estimation From a Single Measurement: Uniqueness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront estimation is an essential component of adaptive optics where the goal is to recover the underlying phase from its Fourier magnitude. While this may sound identical to classical phase retrieval, wavefront estimation faces more strict requirements regarding uniqueness as adaptive optics systems need a unique phase to compensate for the distorted wavefront. Existing real-time wavefront estimation methodologies are dominated by sensing via specialized optical hardware due to their high speed, but they often have a low spatial resolution. A computational method that can perform both fast and accurate wavefront estimation with a single measurement can improve resolution and bring new applications such as real-time passive wavefront estimation, opening the door to a new generation of medical and defense applications.
  In this paper, we tackle the wavefront estimation problem by observing that the non-uniqueness is related to the geometry of the pupil shape. By analyzing the source of ambiguities and breaking the symmetry, we present a joint optics-algorithm approach by co-designing the shape of the pupil and the reconstruction neural network. Using our proposed lightweight neural network, we demonstrate wavefront estimation of a phase of size $128\times 128$ at $5,200$ frames per second on a CPU computer, achieving an average Strehl ratio up to $0.98$ in the noiseless case. We additionally test our method on real measurements using a spatial light modulator. Code is available at https://pages.github.itap.purdue.edu/StanleyChanGroup/wavefront-estimation/.</description>

      <title>Deep Mismatch Channel Estimation in IRS based 6G Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a channel estimation protocol to determine the uplink channel state information (CSI) at the base station for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) based wireless communication. More specifically, we develop a channel estimation scheme in a multi-user system with high estimation accuracy and low computational complexity. One of the state-of-the-art approaches to channel estimation is the deep learning-based approach. However, the data-driven model often experiences high computational complexity and, thus, is slow to channel estimation. Inspired by the success of utilizing domain knowledge to build effective data-driven models, the proposed scheme uses the high channel correlation property to train a shallow deep learning model. More specifically, utilizing the one coherent channel estimation, the model predicts the subsequent channel coherence CSI. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and spectral efficiency (SE) via simulation. The proposed scheme can estimate the CSI with reasonable success of lower NMSE, higher SE, and lower estimation time than existing schemes.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Transmitting and Reflecting Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface with Independent Beam Control and Power Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid transmitting and reflecting beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) design is proposed. Operating in the same aperture, frequency band and polarization, the proposed BD-RIS features independent beam steering control of its reflected and transmitted waves. In addition it provides a hybrid mode with both reflected and transmitted waves using tunable power splitting between beams. The BD-RIS comprises two phase reconfigurable antenna arrays interconnected by an array of tunable two-port power splitters. The two-port power splitter in each BD-RIS cell is built upon a varactor in parallel with a bias inductor to exert tunable impedance variations on transmission lines. Provided with variable reverse DC voltages, the two-port power splitter can control the power ratio of S11 over S21 from -20 dB to 20 dB, thus allowing tunable power splitting. Each antenna is 2-bit phase reconfigurable with 200 MHz bandwidth at 2.4 GHz so that each cell of BD-RIS can also achieve independent reflection and transmission phase control. To characterize and optimize the electromagnetic response of the proposed BD-RIS design, a Th\'evenin equivalent model and corresponding analytical method is provided. A BD-RIS with 4 by 4 cells was also prototyped and tested. Experiments show that in reflection and transmission mode, the fabricated BD-RIS can realize beam steering in reflection and transmission space, respectively. It is also verified that when operating in hybrid mode, the BD-RIS enables independent beam steering of the reflected and transmitted waves. This work helps fill the gap between realizing practical hardware design and establishing an accurate physical model for the hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS, enabling hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS assisted wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave Joint Radar and Communications With an RIS-Integrated Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the joint radar and communications (JRC) framework, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) emerged as a promising technology for their ability to shape the propagation environment by adjusting their phase-shift coefficients. However, achieving perfect synchronization and effective collaboration between access points (APs) and RISs is crucial to successful operation. This paper investigates the performance of a bistatic JRC network operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band, where the receiving AP is equipped with an RIS-integrated array. This system simultaneously serves multiple UEs while estimating the position of a target with limited prior knowledge of its position. To achieve this, we optimize both the power allocation of the transmitted waveform and the RIS phase-shift matrix to minimize the position error bound (PEB) of the target. At the same time, we ensure that the UEs achieve an acceptable level of spectral efficiency. The numerical results show that an RIS-integrated array, even with a small number of receiving antennas, can achieve high localization accuracy. Additionally, optimized phase-shifts significantly improve the localization accuracy in comparison to a random phase-shift configuration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Manifold Optimization: A Design Framework for Future Communications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in various areas of science relevant to quantum computing, we introduce quantum manifold optimization (QMO) as a promising framework for solving constrained optimization problems in next-generation wireless communication systems. We begin by showing how classical wireless design problems - such as pilot design in cell-free (CF)-massive MIMO (mMIMO), beamformer optimization in gigantic multiple input multiple output (MIMO), and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phase tuning - naturally reside on structured manifolds like the Stiefel, Grassmannian, and oblique manifolds, with the latter novelly formulated in this work. Then, we demonstrate how these problems can be reformulated as trace-based quantum expectation values over variationally-encoded quantum states. While theoretical in scope, the work lays a foundation for a new class of quantum optimization algorithms with broad application to the design of future beyond-sixth-generation (B6G) systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Filterless Multi-Color VLC via QCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color shift keying (CSK) in visible light communication (VLC) often suffers from filter-induced crosstalk and reduced brightness. This paper proposes using quartered composite transform (QCT) with multi-color light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to improve both illumination and communication. The proposd DC-biased QCT scheme eliminates receiver optical filters, thereby removing crosstalk and significantly increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulations demonstrate QCT maintains high illumination quality (CRI 79.72, CCT 3462 K) while achieving over double the average illuminance compared to CSK under the same power budget. QCT also shows better bit error rate (BER) performance in low-to-moderate SNR regimes and has ability to convert multi-tap frequency-selective channel into an equivalent single-tap flat-fading channel to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI), proving a promising technique for brighter, high-performance, filter-less VLC.</description>

      <title>Research and Experimental Validation for 3GPP ISAC Channel Modeling Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is considered a key technology in 6G networks. An accurate sensing channel model is crucial for the design and sensing performance evaluation of ISAC systems. The widely used Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM), typically applied in standardized channel modeling, mainly focuses on the statistical fading characteristics of the channel. However, it fails to capture the characteristics of targets in ISAC systems, such as their positions and velocities, as well as the impact of the targets on the background. To address this issue, this paper proposes an extended GBSM (E-GBSM) sensing channel model that incorporates newly discovered channel characteristics into a unified modeling framework. In this framework, the sensing channel is divided into target and background channels. For the target channel, the model introduces a concatenated modeling approach, while for the background channel, a parameter called the power control factor is introduced to assess impact of the target on the background channel, making the modeling framework applicable to both mono-static and bi-static sensing modes. To validate the proposed model's effectiveness, measurements of target and background channels are conducted in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, covering various sensing targets such as metal plates, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, human bodies, UAVs, and vehicles. The experimental results provide important theoretical support and empirical data for the standardization of ISAC channel modeling.</description>

      <title>Finite-Precision Conjugate Gradient Method for Massive MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method for massive MIMO detection is computationally challenging, especially for a large number of users and correlated channels. In this paper, we propose a low computational complexity CG detection from a finite-precision perspective. First, we develop a finite-precision CG (FP-CG) detection to mitigate the computational bottleneck of each CG iteration and provide the attainable accuracy, convergence, and computational complexity analysis to reveal the impact of finite-precision arithmetic. A practical heuristic is presented to select suitable precisions. Then, to further reduce the number of iterations, we propose a joint finite-precision and block-Jacobi preconditioned CG (FP-BJ-CG) detection. The corresponding performance analysis is also provided. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical insights and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed detection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for real-time channel state information (CSI) in sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, channel knowledge map (CKM) emerges as a promising technique, offering a site-specific database that enables environment-awareness and significantly enhances communication and sensing performance by leveraging a priori wireless channel knowledge. However, efficient construction and utilization of CKMs require high-quality, massive, and location-specific channel knowledge data that accurately reflects the real-world environments. Inspired by the great success of ImageNet dataset in advancing computer vision and image understanding in artificial intelligence (AI) community, we introduce CKMImageNet, a dataset developed to bridge AI and environment-aware wireless communications and sensing by integrating location-specific channel knowledge data, high-fidelity environmental maps, and their visual representations. CKMImageNet supports a wide range of AI-driven approaches for CKM construction with spatially consistent and location-specific channel knowledge data, including both supervised and unsupervised, as well as discriminative and generative AI methods.</description>

      <title>Modelling &amp; Steady State Compliance Testing of an Improved Time Synchronized Phasor Measurement Unit Based on IEEE Standard C37.118.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrophasor technology is an emerging and developing technology for monitoring and control of wide area measurement systems (WAMS). In an elementary WAMS, two identical phasors measured at two different locations have difference in the phase angles measured since their reference waveforms are not synchronized with each other. Phasor measurement units (PMUs) measure input phasors with respect to a common reference wave based on the atomic clock pulses received from global positioning system (GPS) satellites, eliminating variation in the measured phase angles due to distant locations of the measurement nodes. This has found tremendous applications in quick fault detection, fault location analysis, accurate current, voltage, frequency and phase angle measurements in WAMS. Commercially available PMU models are often proven to be expensive for research and development as well as for grid integration projects. This research article proposes an economic PMU model optimized for accurate steadystate performance based on recursive discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and provides results and detailed analysis of the proposed PMU model as per the steady state compliance specifications of IEEE standard C37.118.1. Results accurate up to 13 digits after decimal point are obtained through the developed PMU model for both nominal and off-nominal frequency inputs in steady state.</description>

      <title>Fusing Bluetooth with Pedestrian Dead Reckoning: A Floor Plan-Assisted Positioning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floor plans can provide valuable prior information that helps enhance the accuracy of indoor positioning systems. However, existing research typically faces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying it to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for positioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm (FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR). In the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a positioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate himself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the offline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized floor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to identify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the online phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from BLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood estimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a particle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally, FP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on its specific map feature. Experimental results show that FP-BP can achieve a real-time mean positioning accuracy of 1.19 m, representing an improvement of over 28% compared to existing floor plan-fused baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Novel Radar Constant False Alarm Rate Detection Algorithm Based on VAMP Deep Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of deep unfolding with vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm, results in faster convergence and higher sparse recovery accuracy than traditional compressive sensing approaches. However, deep unfolding alters the parameters in traditional VAMP algorithm, resulting in the unattainable distribution parameter of the recovery error of non-sparse noisy estimation via traditional VAMP, which hinders the utilization of VAMP deep unfolding in constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection in sub-Nyquist radar system. Based on VAMP deep unfolding, we provide a parameter convergence detector (PCD) to estimate the recovery error distribution parameter and implement CFAR detection. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, both the sparse solution and non-sparse noisy estimation are utilized to estimate the distribution parameter and implement CFAR detection in PCD, which leverages both the VAMP distribution property and the improved sparse recovery accuracy provided by deep unfolding. Simulation results indicate that PCD offers improved false alarm rate control performance and higher target detection rate.</description>

      <title>Parameter Convergence Detector Based on VAMP Deep Unfolding: A Novel Radar Constant False Alarm Rate Detection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sub-Nyquist radar framework exploits the sparsity of signals, which effectively alleviates the pressure on system storage and transmission bandwidth. Compressed sensing (CS) algorithms, such as the VAMP algorithm, are used for sparse signal processing in the sub-Nyquist radar framework. By combining deep unfolding techniques with VAMP, faster convergence and higher accuracy than traditional CS algorithms are achieved. However, deep unfolding disrupts the parameter constrains in traditional VAMP algorithm, leading to the distribution of non-sparse noisy estimation in VAMP deep unfolding unknown, and its distribution parameter unable to be obtained directly using method of traditional VAMP, which prevents the application of VAMP deep unfolding in radar constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection. To address this problem, we explore the distribution of the non-sparse noisy estimation and propose a parameter convergence detector (PCD) to achieve CFAR detection based on VAMP deep unfolding. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PCD leverages not only the sparse solution, but also the non-sparse noisy estimation, which is used to iteratively estimate the distribution parameter and served as the test statistic in detection process. In this way, the proposed algorithm takes advantage of both the enhanced sparse recovery accuracy from deep unfolding and the distribution property of VAMP, thereby achieving superior CFAR detection performance. Additionally, the PCD requires no information about the power of AWGN in the environment, which is more suitable for practical application. The convergence performance and effectiveness of the proposed PCD are analyzed based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. Numerical simulations and practical data experiments demonstrate that PCD can achieve better false alarm control and target detection performance.</description>

      <title>Fully-Adaptive and Semi-Adaptive Frequency Sweep Algorithm Exploiting Loewner-State Model for EM Simulation of Multiport Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs a fully adaptive and semi-adaptive frequency sweep algorithm using the Loewner matrix-based state model for the electromagnetic simulation. The proposed algorithms use two Loewner matrix models with different or the same orders with small frequency perturbation for adaptive frequency selection. The error between the two models is calculated in each iteration, and the next frequency points are selected to minimize maximum error. With the help of memory, the algorithm terminates when the error between the model and the simulation result is reached within the specified error tolerance. In the fully adaptive frequency sweep algorithm, the method starts with the minimum and maximum frequency of simulation. In the semi-adaptive algorithm, a novel approach has been proposed to determine the initial number of frequency points necessary for system interpolation based on the electrical size of the structure. The proposed algorithms have been compared with the Stoer-Bulirsch algorithm and Pradovera's minimal sampling algorithm for electromagnetic simulation. Four examples are presented using MATLAB R2024b. The results show that the proposed methods offer better performance in terms of speed, accuracy and the requirement of the minimum number of frequency samples. The proposed method shows remarkable consistency with full-wave simulation data, and the algorithm can be effectively applicable to electromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Diversity Analysis for Indoor Terahertz Communication Systems under Small-Scale Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing diversity is fundamental to wireless communication systems, particularly in the terahertz (THz) band, where severe path loss and small-scale fading pose significant challenges to system reliability and performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive diversity analysis for indoor THz communication systems, accounting for the combined effects of path loss and small-scale fading, with the latter modeled as an $\alpha-\mu$ distribution to reflect THz indoor channel conditions. We derive closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as a function of the reciprocal of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and propose an asymptotic expression. Furthermore, we validate these expressions through extensive simulations, which show strong agreement with the theoretical analysis, confirming the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods. Our results show that the diversity order in THz systems is primarily determined by the combined effects of the number of independent paths, the severity of fading, and the degree of channel frequency selectivity, providing clear insights into how diversity gains can be optimized in high-frequency wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Uniform Planar Array Based Weighted Cooperative Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is essential for improving the spectrum efficiency and reliability of cognitive radio applications. Next-generation wireless communication networks increasingly employ uniform planar arrays (UPA) due to their ability to steer beamformers towards desired directions, mitigating interference and eavesdropping. However, the application of UPA-based CSS in cognitive radio remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a multi-beam UPA-based weighted CSS (WCSS) framework to enhance detection reliability, applicable to various cognitive radio networks, including cellular, vehicular, and satellite communications. We first propose a weighting factor for commonly used energy detection (ED) and eigenvalue detection (EVD) techniques, based on the spatial variation of signal strengths resulting from UPA antenna beamforming. We then analytically characterize the performance of both weighted ED and weighted EVD by deriving closed-form expressions for false alarm and detection probabilities. Our numerical results, considering both static and dynamic user behaviors, demonstrate the superiority of WCSS in enhancing sensing performance compared to uniformly weighted detectors.</description>

      <title>Frequency Hopping Waveform Design for Secure Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive approach to enhance the security, privacy, and sensing capabilities of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems by leveraging random frequency agility (RFA) and random pulse repetition interval (PRI) agility (RPA) techniques. The combination of these techniques, which we refer to collectively as random frequency and PRI agility (RFPA), with channel reciprocity-based key generation (CRKG) obfuscates both Doppler frequency and PRIs, significantly hindering the chances that passive adversaries can successfully estimate radar parameters. In addition, a hybrid information embedding method integrating amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial modulation (SM) is incorporated to increase the achievable bit rate of the system significantly. Next, a sparse-matched filter receiver design is proposed to efficiently decode the embedded information with a low bit error rate (BER). Finally, a novel RFPA-based secret generation scheme using CRKG ensures secure code creation without a coordinating authority. The improved range and velocity estimation and reduced clutter effects achieved with the method are demonstrated via the evaluation of the ambiguity function (AF) of the proposed waveforms.</description>

      <title>Learning to Beamform for Cooperative Localization and Communication: A Link Heterogeneous GNN-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks, supporting advanced applications such as high-precision localization and environment reconstruction. Cooperative ISAC (CoISAC) further enhances these capabilities by enabling multiple base stations (BSs) to jointly optimize communication and sensing performance through coordination. However, CoISAC beamforming design faces significant challenges due to system heterogeneity, large-scale problem complexity, and sensitivity to parameter estimation errors. Traditional deep learning-based techniques fail to exploit the unique structural characteristics of CoISAC systems, thereby limiting their ability to enhance system performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Link-Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (LHGNN) for joint beamforming in CoISAC systems. Unlike conventional approaches, LHGNN models communication and sensing links as heterogeneous nodes and their interactions as edges, enabling the capture of the heterogeneous nature and intricate interactions of CoISAC systems. Furthermore, a graph attention mechanism is incorporated to dynamically adjust node and link importance, improving robustness to channel and position estimation errors. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed attention-enhanced LHGNN achieves superior communication rates while maintaining sensing accuracy under power constraints. The proposed method also exhibits strong robustness to communication channel and position estimation error.</description>

      <title>Parametric Near-Field MMSE Channel Estimation for sub-THz XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for reliable communication in sub-THz extremely large (XL) MIMO systems. Deploying XL-MIMO in high-frequency bands not only increases the number of antennas, but also fundamentally alters channel propagation characteristics, placing the user equipments (UE) in the radiative near-field of the base station. This paper proposes a parametric estimation method using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to extract UE location data from uplink pilot signals. These parameters are used to reconstruct the spatial correlation matrix, followed by an approximation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms the least-squares (LS) estimator in terms of the normalized mean-square error (NMSE), even without prior UE location knowledge.</description>

      <title>Joint Localization and Synchronization in Downlink Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate joint localization and synchronization in the downlink of a distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (D-MIMO) system, aiming to estimate the position and phase offset of a single-antenna user equipment (UE) using downlink transmissions of multiple phase-synchronized, multi-antenna access points (APs). We propose two transmission protocols: sequential (P1) and simultaneous (P2) AP transmissions, together with the ML estimators that either leverage (coherent estimator) or disregard phase information (non-coherent estimator). Simulation results reveal that downlink D-MIMO holds significant potential for high-accuracy localization while showing that P2 provides superior localization performance and reduced transmission latency.</description>

      <title>Simulation and Experimental Validation of Optical Camera Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While simulation tools for visible light communication (VLC) with photo detectors (PDs) have been widely investigated, similar tools for optical camera communication (OCC) with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors are lacking in this regard. Camera based VLC systems have much lower data rates owing to camera exposure times. Among the few extant OCC simulation tools, none allow for simulation of images when exposure time is greater than the signal period. An accurate simulation of the OCC system can be used to improve the data rate and quality of performance. We propose a simple simulation technique for OCC which allows to test for system performance at frequencies beyond the camera shutter speed. This will allow much needed data rate improvement by operating at the actual frequency a decoding algorithm ceases detection instead of the exposure limit used now. We have tested the accuracy of simulation by comparing the detection success rates of simulated images with experimental images. The proposed simulation technique was shown to be accurate through experimental validation for two different cameras.</description>

      <title>Tx and Rx IQ Imbalance Compensation for JCAS in 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beside traditional communications, joint communications and sensing (JCAS) is gaining increasing relevance as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. The ability to accurately transmit and receive data is the basis for high-speed communications and precise sensing, where a fundamental requirement is an accurate in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) modulation. For sensing, imperfections in IQ modulation lead to two critical issues in the range-Doppler-map (RDM) in form of an increased noise floor and the presence of ghost objects, degrading the accuracy and reliability of the information in the RDM. This paper presents a low-complex estimation and compensation method to mitigate the IQ imbalance effects. This is achieved by utilizing, amongst others, the leakage signal, which is the direct signal from the transmitter to the receiver path, and is typically the strongest signal component in the RDM. The parameters of the IQ imbalance suppression structure are estimated based on a mixed complex-/real-valued bilinear filter approach, that considers IQ imbalance in the transmitter and the receiver of the JCAS-capable user equipment (UE). The UE uses a 5G New Radio (NR)-compliant orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform with the system configuration assumed to be predefined from the communication side. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulations are conducted, illustrating the performance in the suppression of IQ imbalance introduced distortions in the RDM.</description>

      <title>The Communication and Computation Trade-off in Wireless Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications have emerged as a crucial research direction for future wireless communication networks. However, as wireless systems become increasingly complex, the demands for computation and communication resources in semantic communications continue to grow rapidly. This paper investigates the trade-off between computation and communication in wireless semantic communications, taking into consideration transmission task delay and performance constraints within the semantic communication framework. We propose a novel tradeoff metric to analyze the balance between computation and communication in semantic transmissions and employ the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to minimize this metric, thereby reducing the cost associated with balancing computation and communication. Through simulations, we analyze the tradeoff between computation and communication and demonstrate the effectiveness of optimizing this trade-off metric.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna System (PASS) Enhanced Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS)-assisted convert communication framework is proposed. PASS utilizes dielectric waveguides with freely positioned pinching antennas (PAs) to establish strong line-of-sight links. Capitalizing on this high reconfigurable flexibility of antennas, the potential of PASS for covert communications is investigated. 1)~For the single-waveguide single-PA (SWSP) scenario, a closed-form optimal PA position that maximizes the covert rate is first derived. Subsequently, a one-dimensional power search is employed to enable low-complexity optimization for covert communications. With antenna mobility on a scale of meters, PASS can deal with the challenging situation of the eavesdropper enjoying better channel conditions than the legal user. 2)~For the multi-waveguide multi-PA (MWMP) scenario, the positions of multiple PAs are optimized to enable effective pinching beamforming, thereby enhancing the covert rate. To address the resultant multimodal joint transmit and pinching beamforming problem, a twin particle swarm optimization (TwinPSO) approach is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that: i)~the proposed approaches can effectively resolve the optimization problems; ii)~PASS achieves a higher covert rate than conventional fixed-position antenna architectures; and iii)~with enhanced flexibility, the MWMP setup outperforms the SWSP counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that exploits new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve wireless communication and sensing performance. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication system where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access point (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs. Accordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where the generalized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs' deflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication system achieves significant improvement in achievable secrecy rate as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Analogical Learning for Cross-Scenario Generalization: Framework and Application to Intelligent Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing learning models often exhibit poor generalization when deployed across diverse scenarios. It is mainly due to that the underlying reference frame of the data varies with the deployment environment and settings. However, despite the data of each scenario has its distinct reference frame, its generation generally follows the same underlying physical rule. Based on these findings, this article proposes a brand-new universal deep learning framework named analogical learning (AL), which provides a highly efficient way to implicitly retrieve the reference frame information associated with a scenario and then to make accurate prediction by relative analogy across scenarios. Specifically, an elegant bipartite neural network architecture called Mateformer is designed, the first part of which calculates the relativity within multiple feature spaces between the input data and a small amount of embedded data from the current scenario, while the second part uses these relativity to guide the nonlinear analogy. We apply AL to the typical multi-scenario learning problem of intelligent wireless localization in cellular networks. Extensive experiments show that AL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, stable transferability and robust adaptation to new scenarios without any tuning, and outperforming conventional methods with a precision improvement of nearly two orders of magnitude. All data and code are available at https://github.com/ziruichen-research/ALLoc.</description>

      <title>Towards On-Device Learning and Reconfigurable Hardware Implementation for Encoded Single-Photon Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) enhance the accuracy and efficiency of reconstructing key parameters from time-resolved photon arrival signals recorded by single-photon detectors. However, the performance of conventional backpropagation-based DNNs is highly dependent on various parameters of the optical setup and biological samples under examination, necessitating frequent network retraining, either through transfer learning or from scratch. Newly collected data must also be stored and transferred to a high-performance GPU server for retraining, introducing latency and storage overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an online training algorithm based on a One-Sided Jacobi rotation-based Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSOS-ELM). We fully exploit parallelism in executing OSOS-ELM on a heterogeneous FPGA with integrated ARM cores. Extensive evaluations of OSOS-ELM and OSELM demonstrate that both achieve comparable accuracy across different network dimensions (i.e., input, hidden, and output layers), while OSOS-ELM proves to be more hardware-efficient. By leveraging the parallelism of OSOS-ELM, we implement a holistic computing prototype on a Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, which integrates a multi-core CPU and programmable logic fabric. We validate our approach through three case studies involving single-photon signal analysis: sensing through fog using commercial single-photon LiDAR, fluorescence lifetime estimation in FLIM, and blood flow index reconstruction in DCS, all utilizing one-dimensional data encoded from photonic signals. From a hardware perspective, we optimize the OSOS-ELM workload by employing multi-tasked processing on ARM CPU cores and pipelined execution on the FPGA's logic fabric. We also implement our OSOS-ELM on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX GPU to comprehensively investigate its computing performance on another type of heterogeneous computing platform.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Autoencoder Network for Robust Heart Rate Extraction from Noisy Photoplethysmogram: Applying Blind Source Separation to Biosignal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biosignals can be viewed as mixtures measuring particular physiological events, and blind source separation (BSS) aims to extract underlying source signals from mixtures. This paper proposes a self-supervised multi-encoder autoencoder (MEAE) to separate heartbeat-related source signals from photoplethysmogram (PPG), enhancing heart rate (HR) detection in noisy PPG data. The MEAE is trained on PPG signals from a large open polysomnography database without any pre-processing or data selection. The trained network is then applied to a noisy PPG dataset collected during the daily activities of nine subjects. The extracted heartbeat-related source signal significantly improves HR detection as compared to the original PPG. The absence of pre-processing and the self-supervised nature of the proposed method, combined with its strong performance, highlight the potential of BSS in biosignal analysis.</description>

      <title>Accurate Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Using an Explainable Machine Learning with Mid-Infrared Biomolecular Fingerprinting of Nasopharyngeal Secretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of respiratory viruses (RVs) is critical for outbreak control and public health. This study presents a diagnostic system that combines Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) from nasopharyngeal secretions with an explainable Rotary Position Embedding-Sparse Attention Transformer (RoPE-SAT) model to accurately identify multiple RVs within 10 minutes. Spectral data (4000-00 cm-1) were collected, and the bio-fingerprint region (1800-900 cm-1) was employed for analysis. Standard normal variate (SNV) normalization and second-order derivation were applied to reduce scattering and baseline drift. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to generate saliency maps, highlighting spectral regions most relevant to classification and enhancing the interpretability of model outputs. Two independent cohorts from Beijing Youan Hospital, processed with different viral transport media (VTMs) and drying methods, were evaluated, with one including influenza B, SARS-CoV-2, and healthy controls, and the other including mycoplasma, SARS-CoV-2, and healthy controls. The model achieved sensitivity and specificity above 94.40% across both cohorts. By correlating model-selected infrared regions with known biomolecular signatures, we verified that the system effectively recognizes virus-specific spectral fingerprints, including lipids, Amide I, Amide II, Amide III, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, and leverages their weighted contributions for accurate classification.</description>

      <title>Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Prediction Models for Data Debiasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bias in data collection, arising from both under-reporting and over-reporting, poses significant challenges in critical applications such as healthcare and public safety. In this work, we introduce Graph-based Over- and Under-reporting Debiasing (GROUD), a novel graph-based optimization framework that debiases reported data by jointly estimating the true incident counts and the associated reporting bias probabilities. By modeling the bias as a smooth signal over a graph constructed from geophysical or feature-based similarities, our convex formulation not only ensures a unique solution but also comes with theoretical recovery guarantees under certain assumptions. We validate GROUD on both challenging simulated experiments and real-world datasets -- including Atlanta emergency calls and COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports -- demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in accurately recovering debiased counts. This approach paves the way for more reliable downstream decision-making in systems affected by reporting irregularities.</description>

      <title>PLS-Assisted Offloading for Edge Computing-Enabled Post-Quantum Security in Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, it has become imperative for resource-constrained devices (RCDs) in the Internet of Things (IoT) to adopt these quantum-resistant protocols. However, the high computational overhead and the large key sizes associated with PQC make direct deployment on such devices impractical. To address this challenge, we propose an edge computing-enabled PQC framework that leverages a physical-layer security (PLS)-assisted offloading strategy, allowing devices to either offload intensive cryptographic tasks to a post-quantum edge server (PQES) or perform them locally. Furthermore, to ensure data confidentiality within the edge domain, our framework integrates two PLS techniques: offloading RCDs employ wiretap coding to secure data transmission, while non-offloading RCDs serve as friendly jammers by broadcasting artificial noise to disrupt potential eavesdroppers. Accordingly, we co-design the computation offloading and PLS strategy by jointly optimizing the device transmit power, PQES computation resource allocation, and offloading decisions to minimize overall latency under resource constraints. Numerical results demonstrate significant latency reductions compared to baseline schemes, confirming the scalability and efficiency of our approach for secure PQC operations in IoT networks.</description>

      <title>On Stochastic Performance Analysis of Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target angular location, and counteract eavesdropping threats. The system includes a passive single-antenna communication eavesdropper and a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target location. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target azimuth angle is uniformly distributed. To evaluate the performance, we derive exact expressions for the secrecy ergodic rate and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for target localization at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. Numerical results validate our findings.</description>

      <title>SegOTA: Accelerating Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Segmented Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) with over-the-air computation efficiently utilizes the communication resources, but it can still experience significant latency when each device transmits a large number of model parameters to the server. This paper proposes the Segmented Over-The-Air (SegOTA) method for FL, which reduces latency by partitioning devices into groups and letting each group transmit only one segment of the model parameters in each communication round. Considering a multi-antenna server, we model the SegOTA transmission and reception process to establish an upper bound on the expected model learning optimality gap. We minimize this upper bound, by formulating the per-round online optimization of device grouping and joint transmit-receive beamforming, for which we derive efficient closed-form solutions. Simulation results show that our proposed SegOTA substantially outperforms the conventional full-model OTA approach and other common alternatives.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ray Tracing-Based Wireless Channels Generation for Real-Time Network Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ray tracing (RT) simulation is a widely used approach to enable modeling wireless channels in applications such as network digital twins. However, the computational cost to execute RT is proportional to factors such as the level of detail used in the adopted 3D scenario. This work proposes RT pre-processing algorithms that aim at simplifying the 3D scene without distorting the channel. It also proposes a post-processing method that augments a set of RT results to achieve an improved time resolution. These methods enable using RT in applications that use a detailed and photorealistic 3D scenario, while generating consistent wireless channels over time. Our simulation results with different 3D scenarios demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the simulation time by more than 50% without compromising the accuracy of the RT parameters.</description>

      <title>Passive Channel Charting: Locating Passive Targets using Wi-Fi Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose passive channel charting, an extension of channel charting to passive target localization. As in conventional channel charting, we follow a dimensionality reduction approach to reconstruct a physically interpretable map of target positions from similarities in high-dimensional channel state information. We show that algorithms and neural network architectures developed in the context of channel charting with active mobile transmitters can be straightforwardly applied to the passive case, where we assume a scenario with static transmitters and receivers and a mobile target. We evaluate our method on a channel state information dataset collected indoors with a distributed setup of ESPARGOS Wi-Fi sensing antenna arrays. This scenario can be interpreted as either a multi-static or passive radar system. We demonstrate that passive channel charting outperforms a baseline based on classical triangulation in terms of localization accuracy. We discuss our results and highlight some unsolved issues related to the proposed concept.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty propagation in the discrete Fourier transform by modeling the fast Fourier transform as a factor graph. Building on this representation, we propose an efficient framework for approximate Bayesian inference using belief propagation (BP) and expectation propagation, extending its applicability beyond Gaussian assumptions. By leveraging an appropriate BP message representation and a suitable schedule, our method achieves stable convergence with accurate mean and variance estimates. Numerical experiments in representative scenarios from communications demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed framework for uncertainty-aware inference in probabilistic systems operating across both time and frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Position Error Bound and Power Allocation Scheme for Cell-Free mMIMO-OTFS ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates multi-target position estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) architectures, where orthogonal time frequency and space (OTFS) is used as an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signal. Closed-form expressions for the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound and the positioning error bound (PEB) in multi-target position estimation are derived, providing quantitative evaluations of sensing performance. To enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, a power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the minimum user communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring a specified sensing PEB requirement. The results validate the proposed PEB expression and its approximation, clearly illustrating the coordination gain enabled by ISAC. Further, the superiority of using the multi-static CF mMIMO architecture over traditional cellular ISAC is demonstrated, and the advantages of OTFS signals in high-mobility scenarios are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sensor Steering Strategy Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Data Acquisition in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensor steering methodology based on deep reinforcement learning to enhance the predictive accuracy and decision support capabilities of digital twins by optimising the data acquisition process. Traditional sensor placement techniques are often constrained by one-off optimisation strategies, which limit their applicability for online applications requiring continuous informative data assimilation. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by offering an adaptive framework for sensor placement within the digital twin paradigm. The sensor placement problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the training and deployment of an agent capable of dynamically repositioning sensors in response to the evolving conditions of the physical structure as represented by the digital twin. This ensures that the digital twin maintains a highly representative and reliable connection to its physical counterpart. The proposed framework is validated through a series of comprehensive case studies involving a cantilever plate structure subjected to diverse conditions, including healthy and damaged conditions. The results demonstrate the capability of the deep reinforcement learning agent to adaptively reposition sensors improving the quality of data acquisition and hence enhancing the overall accuracy of digital twins.</description>

      <title>Artificial Neural Network for Estimation of Physical Parameters of Sea Water using LiDAR Waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are fast emerging sensors in the field of Earth Observation. It is a remote sensing technology that utilizes laser beams to measure distances and create detailed three-dimensional representations of objects and environments. The potential of Full Waveform LiDAR is much greater than just height estimation and 3D reconstruction only. Overall shape of signal provides important information about properties of water body. However, the shape of FWL is unexplored as most LiDAR software work on point cloud by utilizing the maximum value within the waveform. Existing techniques in the field of LiDAR data analysis include depth estimation through inverse modeling and regression of logarithmic intensity and depth for approximating the attenuation coefficient. However, these methods suffer from limitations in accuracy. Depth estimation through inverse modeling provides only approximate values and does not account for variations in surface properties, while the regression approach for the attenuation coefficient is only able to generalize a value through several data points which lacks precision and may lead to significant errors in estimation. Additionally, there is currently no established modeling method available for predicting bottom reflectance. This research proposed a novel solution based on neural networks for parameter estimation in LIDAR data analysis. By leveraging the power of neural networks, the proposed solution successfully learned the inversion model, was able to do prediction of parameters such as depth, attenuation coefficient, and bottom reflectance. Performance of model was validated by testing it on real LiDAR data. In future, more data availability would enable more accuracy and reliability of such models.</description>

Abstract: User mobility in extended reality (XR) can have a major impact on millimeter-wave (mmWave) links and may require dedicated mitigation strategies to ensure reliable connections and avoid outage. The available prior art has predominantly focused on XR applications with constrained user mobility and limited impact on mmWave channels. We have performed dedicated experiments to extend the characterisation of relevant future XR use cases featuring a high degree of user mobility. To this end, we have carried out a tailor-made measurement campaign and conducted a characterisation of the collected tracking data, including the approximation of the data using statistical distributions. Moreover, we have provided an interpretation of the possible impact of the recorded mobility on mmWave technology. The dataset is made publicly accessible to provide a testing ground for wireless system design and to enable further XR mobility modelling.</description>

      <title>EEG-based Decoding of Selective Visual Attention in Superimposed Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selective attention enables humans to efficiently process visual stimuli by enhancing important elements and filtering out irrelevant information. Locating visual attention is fundamental in neuroscience with potential applications in brain-computer interfaces. Conventional paradigms often use synthetic stimuli or static images, but visual stimuli in real life contain smooth and highly irregular dynamics. We show that these irregular dynamics can be decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) signals for selective visual attention decoding. To this end, we propose a free-viewing paradigm in which participants attend to one of two superimposed videos, each showing a center-aligned person performing a stage act. Superimposing ensures that the relative differences in the neural responses are not driven by differences in object locations. A stimulus-informed decoder is trained to extract EEG components correlated with the motion patterns of the attended object, and can detect the attended object in unseen data with significantly above-chance accuracy. This shows that the EEG responses to naturalistic motion are modulated by selective attention. Eye movements are also found to be correlated to the motion patterns in the attended video, despite the spatial overlap with the distractor. We further show that these eye movements do not dominantly drive the EEG-based decoding and that complementary information exists in EEG and gaze data. Moreover, our results indicate that EEG may also capture neural responses to unattended objects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore EEG-based selective visual attention decoding on natural videos, opening new possibilities for experiment design.</description>

      <title>CAPA: Continuous-Aperture Arrays for Revolutionizing 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based wireless communication architecture is proposed, which relies on an electrically large aperture with a continuous current distribution. First, an existing prototype of CAPA is reviewed, followed by the potential benefits and key motivations for employing CAPAs in wireless communications. Then, three practical hardware implementation approaches for CAPAs are introduced based on electronic, optical, and acoustic materials. Furthermore, several beamforming approaches are proposed to optimize the continuous current distributions of CAPAs, which are fundamentally different from those used for conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). Numerical results are provided to demonstrate their key features in low complexity and near-optimality. Based on these proposed approaches, the performance gains of CAPAs over SPDAs are revealed in terms of channel capacity as well as diversity-multiplexing gains. Finally, several open research problems in CAPA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>A Tensor-Structured Approach to Dynamic Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems with Temporal Non-Stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In moderate- to high-mobility scenarios, CSI varies rapidly and becomes temporally non-stationary, leading to severe performance degradation in the massive MIMO transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a tensor-structured approach to dynamic channel prediction (TS-DCP) for massive MIMO systems with temporal non-stationarity, exploiting both dual-timescale and cross-domain correlations. Specifically, due to inherent spatial consistency, non-stationary channels over long-timescales can be approximated as stationary on short-timescales, decoupling complicated temporal correlations into more tractable dual-timescale ones. To exploit such property, we propose the sliding frame structure composed of multiple pilot OFDM symbols, which capture short-timescale correlations within frames by Doppler domain modeling and long-timescale correlations across frames by Markov/autoregressive processes. Building on this, we develop the Tucker-based spatial-frequency-temporal domain channel model, incorporating angle-delay-Doppler (ADD) domain channels and factor matrices parameterized by ADD domain grids. Furthermore, we model cross-domain correlations of ADD domain channels within each frame, induced by clustered scattering, through the Markov random field and tensor-coupled Gaussian distribution that incorporates high-order neighboring structures. Following these probabilistic models, we formulate the TS-DCP problem as variational free energy (VFE) minimization, and unify different inference rules through the structure design of trial beliefs. This formulation results in the dual-layer VFE optimization process and yields the online TS-DCP algorithm, where the computational complexity is reduced by exploiting tensor-structured operations. Numerical simulations demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm over benchmarks in terms of channel prediction performance.</description>

      <title>CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07236v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinching antennas is a novel flexible-antenna technology, which can be realized by employing small dielectric particles on a waveguide. The aim of this letter is to characterize the array gain achieved by pinching-antenna systems (PASS). A closed-form upper bound on the array gain is derived by fixing the inter-antenna spacing. Asymptotic analyses of this bound are conducted by considering an infinitely large number of antennas, demonstrating the existence of an optimal number of antennas that maximizes the array gain. To approach this bound, an antenna position refinement method is introduced. The relationship between the array gain and inter-antenna spacing is further explored by incorporating the effect of mutual coupling. It is proven that there also exists an optimal inter-antenna spacing that maximizes the array gain. Numerical results demonstrate that by optimizing the number of antennas and inter-antenna spacing, PASS can achieve a significantly larger array gain than conventional-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Continual Learning for Edge Intelligence in Wireless ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting. Experimental evaluations show that EdgeCL achieves 89% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of packet-based information routing in large-scale wireless communication networks. The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</description>

      <title>Utilizing 5G NR SSB Blocks for Passive Detection and Localization of Low-Altitude Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry and a broad range of applications expected to appear in the coming years, the employment of traditional radar systems is becoming increasingly cumbersome for UAV supervision. Motivated by this emerging challenge, this paper investigates the feasibility of employing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems implemented over current and future wireless networks to perform this task. We propose a sensing mechanism based on the synchronization signal block (SSB) in the fifth-generation (5G) standard that performs sensing in a passive bistatic setting. By assuming planar arrays at the sensing nodes and according to the 5G standard, we consider that the SSB signal is sent in a grid of orthogonal beams that are multiplexed in time, with some of them pointing toward a surveillance region where low-altitude drones can be flying. The Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) is derived as the theoretical bound for range and velocity estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of employing SSB signals for UAV-like target localization at low SNR.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Position-Aided Beam Selection for mmWave MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems rely on highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss and ensure robust communication links. However, selecting the optimal beam pair efficiently remains a challenge due to the large search space and the overhead of conventional methods. This paper proposes a probabilistic position-aided beam selection approach that exploits the statistical dependence between user equipment (UE) positions and optimal beam indices. We model the underlying joint probability mass function (PMF) of the positions and the beam indices as a low-rank tensor and estimate its parameters from training data using Bayesian inference. The estimated model is then used to predict the best (or a list of the top) beam pair indices for new UE positions. The proposed method is evaluated using data generated from a state-of-the-art ray tracing simulator and compared with neural network-based and fingerprinting approaches. The results show that our approach achieves a high data rate with fewer training samples and a significantly reduced beam search space. These advantages render it a promising solution for practical mmWave MIMO deployments, reducing the beam search overhead while maintaining a reliable connectivity.</description>

      <title>Filtering through a topological lens: homology for point processes on the time-frequency plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a very general approach to the analysis of signals from their noisy measurements from the perspective of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). While TDA has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for data with pronounced topological structures, here we demonstrate its applicability for general problems of signal processing, without any a-priori geometric feature. Our methods are well-suited to a wide array of time-dependent signals in different scientific domains, with acoustic signals being a particularly important application. We invoke time-frequency representations of such signals, focusing on their zeros which are gaining salience as a signal processing tool in view of their stability properties. Leveraging state-of-the-art topological concepts, such as stable and minimal volumes, we develop a complete suite of TDA-based methods to explore the delicate stochastic geometry of these zeros, capturing signals based on the disruption they cause to this rigid, hyperuniform spatial structure. Unlike classical spatial data tools, TDA is able to capture the full spectrum of the stochastic geometry of the zeros, thereby leading to powerful inferential outcomes that are underpinned by a principled statistical foundation. This is reflected in the power and versatility of our applications, which include competitive performance in processing. a wide variety of audio signals (esp. in low SNR regimes), effective detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave signals (a reputed signal processing challenge with non-Gaussian noise), and medical time series data from EEGs, indicating a wide horizon for the approach and methods introduced in this paper.</description>

      <title>Towards Simple Machine Learning Baselines for GNSS RFI Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning research in GNSS radio frequency interference (RFI) detection often lacks a clear empirical justification for the choice of deep learning architectures over simpler machine learning approaches. In this work, we argue for a change in research direction-from developing ever more complex deep learning models to carefully assessing their real-world effectiveness in comparison to interpretable and lightweight machine learning baselines. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art deep learning models frequently fail to outperform simple, well-engineered machine learning methods in the context of GNSS RFI detection. Leveraging a unique large-scale dataset collected by the Swiss Air Force and Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega), and preprocessed by Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (Skyguide), we demonstrate that a simple baseline model achieves 91\% accuracy in detecting GNSS RFI, outperforming more complex deep learning counterparts. These results highlight the effectiveness of pragmatic solutions and offer valuable insights to guide future research in this critical application domain.</description>

      <title>Delay Violation Probability and Effective Rate of Downlink NOMA over $\alpha$-$\mu$ Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.16505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential candidate to further enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) standards. However, there has been little attention on the quantification of the delay-limited performance of downlink NOMA systems. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a two-user downlink NOMA system over generalized {\alpha}-{\mu} fading in terms of delay violation probability (DVP) and effective rate (ER). In particular, we derive an analytical expression for an upper bound on the DVP and we derive the exact sum ER of the downlink NOMA system. We also derive analytical expressions for high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations to the sum ER, as well as a fundamental upper bound on the sum ER which represents the ergodic sum-rate for the downlink NOMA system. We also analyze the sum ER of a corresponding time-division-multiplexed orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. Our results show that while NOMA consistently outperforms OMA over the practical SNR range, the relative gain becomes smaller in more severe fading conditions, and is also smaller in the presence a more strict delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint.</description>

      <title>Toward 6G Native-AI Network: Foundation Model based Cloud-Edge-End Collaboration Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are in a position to move beyond data-centric, device-oriented connectivity and offer intelligent, immersive experiences based on multi-agent collaboration, especially in the context of the thriving development of pre-trained foundation models (PFM) and the evolving vision of 6G native artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, redefining modes of collaboration between devices and agents, and constructing native intelligence libraries become critically important in 6G. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of achieving 6G native AI from the perspectives of data, AI models, and operational paradigm. Then, we propose a 6G native AI framework based on foundation models, provide an integration method for the expert knowledge, present the customization for two kinds of PFM, and outline a novel operational paradigm for the native AI framework. As a practical use case, we apply this framework for orchestration, achieving the maximum sum rate within a cell-free massive MIMO system, and presenting preliminary evaluation results. Finally, we outline research directions for achieving native AI in 6G.</description>

      <title>LoFi: Vision-Aided Label Generator for Wi-Fi Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven Wi-Fi localization and tracking have shown great promise due to their lower reliance on specialized hardware compared to model-based methods. However, most existing data collection techniques provide only coarse-grained ground truth or a limited number of labeled points, significantly hindering the advancement of data-driven approaches. While systems like lidar can deliver precise ground truth, their high costs make them inaccessible to many users. To address these challenges, we propose LoFi, a vision-aided label generator for Wi-Fi localization and tracking. LoFi can generate ground truth position coordinates solely from 2D images, offering high precision, low cost, and ease of use. Utilizing our method, we have compiled a Wi-Fi tracking and localization dataset using the ESP32-S3 and a webcam, which will be open-sourced along with the code upon publication.</description>

      <title>Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A globally distributed multimodal building damage assessment dataset with very-high-resolution for all-weather disaster response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</description>
