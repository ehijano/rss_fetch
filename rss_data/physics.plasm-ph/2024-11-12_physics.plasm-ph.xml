      <title>Twisted terahertz radiation generation using Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulse propagating in axially magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical and simulation study of twisted terahertz (THz) radiation generation via propagation of a circularly polarized Laguerre Gaussian (LG) laser pulse in homogeneous plasma embedded in an axial magnetic field. Analytical formulation is based on perturbation technique and quasistatic approximation. Longitudinal and transverse wakefields generated via laser plasma interactions are evaluated using Lorentz force and Maxwells equations in the mildly nonlinear regime. It is observed that two linearly polarized twisted terahertz (THz) radiation beams are generated in mutually perpendicular planes. Superposition of the two beams result in a single linearly polarized twisted THz radiation beam with modified amplitude and polarization direction. Three dimensional (3D) particle in cell (PIC) simulations are performed for this configuration using FBPIC code. Graphical comparison of amplitude of the resultant THz beam obtained via analytical and simulation studies is presented.</description>

      <title>Improved scaling of the scrape-off layer particle flux width by the Bayes theorem on EAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of scrape-off layer (SOL) power width ({\lambda}q) is essential for advancing the understanding of particle and heat transport in the SOL. Due to the sparse layout of divertor Langmuir probes (Div-LPs) and probe erosion during long-pulse, high-performance operations on EAST, estimating SOL particle flux width ({\lambda}js, used to approximate {\lambda}q) from the ion saturation current density profile (js) often incurs substantial uncertainty. This study presents a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method based on Bayes' theorem, achieving approximately 30% improvement in fitting accuracy over traditional ordinary least squares. Using this method and the FreeGS equilibrium code, we updated databases from Liu et al., Nucl. Fusion 64 (2024). Revised {\lambda}js scalings for L-mode and H-mode in deuterium and helium plasmas demonstrate better regression quality and slightly altered regression results. Unified L-mode and H-mode scalings in deuterium and helium are: {\lambda}_js^L = 0.11 L_c^1.06 n_e^0.35 Z^0.32 P_SOL^0.25 p^(-0.26) and {\lambda}_js^H = 0.11 L_c^1.28 n_e^0.56 Z^0.36 P_SOL^0.30, where L_c is the average SOL connection length, n_e the line-averaged electron density, Z the charge number, PSOL the power crossing the last closed flux surface, and p the core-averaged plasma pressure. Key findings include: (i) {\lambda}js strongly depends on SOL connection length, indicating a machine size dependence absent in the Eich scaling, and (ii) helium {\lambda}js is slightly larger than deuterium {\lambda}js. Extrapolated scalings suggest {\lambda}q ~ 6 mm for ITER L-mode (Ip = 12 MA) and ~13 mm for H-mode (Ip = 15 MA).</description>

      <title>Temperature Relaxation Rates in Strongly Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly magnetized plasmas, characterized by having a gyrofrequency larger than the plasma frequency ($\beta = \omega_c/\omega_p \gg 1$), are known to exhibit novel transport properties. Previous works studying pure electron plasmas have shown that strong magnetization significantly inhibits energy exchange between parallel and perpendicular directions, leading to a prolonged time for relaxation of a temperature anisotropy. Recent work studying repulsive electron-ion interactions showed that strong magnetization increases both the parallel and perpendicular temperature relaxation rates of ions, but in differing magnitudes, resulting in the formation of temperature anisotropy during equilibration. This previous study treated electrons as a heat bath and assumed weak magnetization of ions. Here, we broaden this analysis and compute the full temperature and temperature anisotropy evolution over a broad range of magnetic field strengths. It is found that when electrons are strongly magnetized ($\beta_e \gg 1$) and ions are weakly magnetized ($\beta_i \ll 1$), the magnetic field strongly suppresses the perpendicular energy exchange rate of electrons, whereas the parallel exchange rate slightly increases in magnitude compared to the value at weak magnetization. In contrast, the ion perpendicular and parallel energy exchange rates both increase in magnitude compared to the values at weak magnetization. Consequently, equilibration causes the electron parallel temperature to rapidly align with the ion temperature, while the electron perpendicular temperature changes much more slowly. It is also shown that when both ions and electrons are strongly magnetized ($\beta_i, \beta_e \gg 1$) the ion-electron perpendicular relaxation rate dramatically decreases with magnetization strength as well.</description>

      <title>Time delay estimation of coherent structure velocities from a super-position of localized pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a novel method for estimating two-dimensional velocities using coarse-grained imaging data, which is particularly relevant for applications in plasma diagnostics. The method utilizes measurements from three non-collinear points and is derived from a stochastic model that describes the propagation of uncorrelated pulses through two-dimensional space. This model builds upon a well-studied one-dimensional model used to analyze turbulence in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas. We demonstrate that the method provides exact time delay estimates when applied to a superposition of Gaussian structures and remains accurate for various other pulse functions. Through extensive numerical simulations, we evaluate the method's performance under different conditions, including variations in signal duration, pulse overlap, spatial and temporal resolution, and the presence of additive noise. Additionally, we investigate the impact of temporal pulse evolution due to linear damping and explore the so-called barberpole effect, which occurs with elongated and tilted structures. Our analysis reveals that the three-point method effectively addresses the limitations encountered with two-point techniques, particularly at coarse spatial resolutions. Although the method is susceptible to the barberpole effect, we analytically demonstrate that this effect does not occur when the elongated structures propagate parallel to one of their axes, and we establish bounds for the associated errors. Overall, our findings provide a comprehensive and robust framework for accurate two-dimensional velocity estimation, enhancing the capabilities of fusion plasma diagnostics and potentially benefiting other fields requiring precise motion analysis.</description>

      <title>Effects of Laser Polarization on Target Focusing and Acceleration in a Laser-Ion Lens and Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the process of ion acceleration using ultra-thin foils irradiated by elliptically polarized, high-intensity laser pulses. Recently, efficient generation of monoenergetic ion beams was introduced using the concept of laser-ion lensing and acceleration (LILA). LILA is an innovative technique where the target's radially varying thickness enables simultaneous acceleration and focusing of a proton beam. In this work, we extend the LILA framework to incorporate elliptically polarized (EP) laser pulses. While it's commonly assumed that EP lasers are unsuitable for radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) due to excessive electron heating that compromises ion acceleration, our multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations challenge this notion. We show that, with proper optimization of the target's average thickness, EP laser pulses can successfully drive the LILA mechanism. We also demonstrate that with a non-uniform thickness target, even linearly polarized laser pulses can efficiently generate low-emittance focused ion beams, with the overall laser-to-ions energy conversion comparable to those predicted for circularly polarized laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Integrated modelling of equilibrium and transport in axisymmetric magnetic mirror fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Hammir tandem mirror design based on Realta Fusion's first-of-a-kind model for axisymmetric magnetic mirror fusion performance. This model uses an integrated end plug simulation model including, heating, equilibrium, and transport combined with a new formulation of the plasma operation contours (POPCONs) technique for the tandem mirror central cell. Using this model, it is shown that an end plug utilizing high temperature superconducting magnets and modern neutral beams enables a classical tandem mirror pilot plant producing a fusion gain Q &gt; 5. The approach here represents an important advance in tandem mirror design. The high fidelity end plug model enables calculations of heating and transport in the highly non-Maxwellian end plug to be made more accurately and the central cell POPCON technique allows consideration of a wide range of parameters in the relatively simple near-Maxwellian central cell, facilitating the selection of more optimal central cell plasmas. These advances make it possible to find more conservative classical tandem mirror fusion pilot plant operating points with lower $\beta$, temperatures, neutral beam energies, and end plug performance than designs in the literature. Despite being more conservative, it is shown that these operating points can still form the basis of a viable fusion pilot plant.</description>

      <title>Z Pinch Kinetics I -- A Particle Perspective: Transitional Magnetization and Cyclotron and Betatron Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-particle orbits are investigated as the basis of a coherent kinetic theory. Analytic solutions including azimuthal circulation are obtained in elliptic functions, of which ideal cyclotron and betatron motions are limiting solutions. The elliptic modulus depends on a trapping parameter and an axis-encircling to axial-drift kinetic energy ratio. Large trapping parameters limit to guiding-center cyclotron motion, while small trapping parameters describe ideal betatron motion. The analytic solutions inform a separation of phase space into trapped and passing trajectories, with which the Bennett solution is decomposed into cyclotron and betatron distributions. The two partial densities are computed to reveal a transitional magnetization layer the extent of which depends only on an ensemble-averaged trapping parameter, equivalent to: the Budker parameter, the pinch-to-Alfv\'{e}n current ratio, the Larmor radius parameter squared, the Hall parameter squared, the drift parameter squared, and the Hartmann number squared. The interplay of diamagnetic current and axial betatron flux is clarified through partial current densities, and the radial electric fields of shear flows are observed to influence ion orbits particularly around unity Budker parameter.</description>

      <title>Z Pinch Kinetics II -- A Continuum Perspective: Betatron Heating and Self-Generation of Sheared Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic compression of a self-magnetizing current filament (a Z pinch) is analyzed via the adiabatic invariants of its constituent cyclotron and betatron motions. Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) models are recovered for both trajectories but with distinct anisotropy axes, about the magnetic field for cyclotron fluid and about the electric current for betatron fluid. In particular, betatron heating produces agyrotropic anisotropy which balances with gyrophase mixing. A hybrid CGL model is proposed based on the local densities of cyclotron and betatron orbits, then validated by numerical experiments. The relation between anisotropy and shear is explored by constructing the kinetic equilibrium of a flow expanded in the flux function. Flow as a linear flux function is simply bi-Maxwellian, while higher powers display higher-moment deviations. Next, weakly collisional gyroviscosity (magnetized pressure-strain) is considered in a forward process (forced flow) and an inverse process (forced anisotropy). The forward process phase-mixes flow into a simple flux function, freezing flow into flux and inducing anisotropy. In the inverse process, betatron heating-induced anisotropy self-generates a sheared flow to resist changes in flux. This flow, arising from momentum diffusion, is concentrated in the betatron region.</description>

      <title>Landau Damping for Non-Maxwellian Distribution Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau damping is one of the cornerstones of plasma physics. In the context of the mathematical framework developed by Landau in his original derivation of Landau damping, we examine the solutions of the linear Vlasov-Poisson system for different equilibrium velocity distribution functions, such as the Maxwellian distribution, kappa distributions, and cut-off distributions without and with energy diffusion. Specifically, we focus on the full set of roots that the dispersion relation of the linear Vlasov-Poisson system generally admits, and we wonder if the full structure of solutions might hint at a deeper understanding of the Landau damping phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Towards Model-free Temperature Diagnostics of Warm Dense Matter from Multiple Scattering Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm dense matter (WDM) plays an important role in astrophysical objects and technological applications, but the rigorous diagnostics of corresponding experiments is notoriously difficult. In this work, we present a model-free analysis of x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements at multiple scattering angles. Specifically, we analyze scattering data that have been collected for isochorically heated graphite at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Overall, we find good consistency in the extracted temperature between small and large scattering angles, whereas possible signatures of non-equilibrium may be hidden by the source function, and by the available dynamic spectral range. The present proof-of-principle study directly points to improved experimental set-ups for equation-of-state measurements and for the model-free study of relaxation times.</description>

      <title>A High-Power Microwave Limiter Using A Self-Actuated Plasma-Based EIT Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel metamaterial topology incorporating gas discharge tubes for high-power microwave protection. The design features two split ring resonators positioned side by side with their splits oriented orthogonally. When exposed to low-power microwaves, each split ring resonator induces a resonance that interacts to create a passband within a broad stopband, facilitated by a phenomenon known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). At high power levels, the integrated gas discharge tubes become ionized, forming plasma that acts as a switch to eliminate the EIT window, thereby reinstating the stopband for protection. Several prototypes have been developed for S-band operation based on this concept. Analytical, numerical, and experimental results are in complete agreement. The proposed device demonstrates superior protection with lower insertion loss in the OFF mode and higher isolation in the ON mode. Its strong ability to handle high-power microwaves is achieved using plasma-based switches instead of diodes, providing a reasonable response time and a straightforward design that enables rapid prototyping. Additionally, the device demonstrates frequency and power threshold tunability, highlighting its versatility as a microwave protection device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MONKES is a new neoclassical code for the evaluation of monoenergetic transport coefficients in stellarators. By means of a convergence study and benchmarks with other codes, it is shown that MONKES is accurate and efficient. The combination of spectral discretization in spatial and velocity coordinates with block sparsity allows MONKES to compute monoenergetic coefficients at low collisionality, in a single core, in approximately one minute. MONKES is sufficiently fast to be integrated into stellarator optimization codes for direct optimization of the bootstrap current and to be included in predictive transport suites. The code and data from this paper are available at https://github.com/JavierEscoto/MONKES/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic theory of particles near resonances is a current topic of discussion in plasma physics and astrophysics. We extend this discussion to the kinetic theory of the interaction between alpha particles (energetic particles predicted to exist in large quantities in next-generation fusion experiments) and a neoclassical tearing mode (NTM), a resistively-driven perturbation that sometimes exists in a tokamak. We develop a quasilinear treatment of the interaction between alphas and an NTM, showing why an NTM can be a source of significant passing alpha particle transport in tokamaks. The limitations on quasilinear theory constrain our theory's applicability to small amplitude NTMs, highlighting the importance of nonlinear studies.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the blowout plasma wakefields produced by drive beams with elliptical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the underdense (blowout) regime of plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), the particle beam is denser than the plasma. Under these conditions, the plasma electrons are nearly completely rarefacted from the beam channel, resulting in a nominally uniform ion column. Extensive investigations of this interaction assuming axisymmetry have been undertaken. However, the plasma blowout produced by a transversely asymmetric driver possesses quite different characteristics. They create an asymmetric plasma rarefaction region (bubble) which leads to asymmetric focusing in the two transverse planes. This is also accompanied by an undesired non-uniform accelerating gradient. The asymmetric blowout cross-section is found through simulation to be elliptical, and treating it as such permits a simple extension of the symmetric theory. In particular, focusing fields linear in both transverse directions exist in the bubble. The form of the wake potential and the concomitant matching conditions in this elliptical cavity are discussed in this paper. We also discuss bubble boundary estimation in the long driver limit and applications of the asymmetric features of the wakefield.</description>

Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>
