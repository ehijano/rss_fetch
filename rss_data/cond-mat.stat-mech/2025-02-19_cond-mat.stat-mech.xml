      <title>Global Ashkin-Teller Phase Diagrams in Two and Three Dimensions: Multicritical Bifurcation versus Double Tricriticality Endpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global phase diagrams of the Askin-Teller model are calculated in d=2 and 3 by renormalization-group theory that is exact on the hierarchical lattice and approximate on the recently improved Migdal-Kadanoff procedure. Three different ordered phases occur in the dimensionally distinct phase diagrams that reflect three-fold order-parameter permutation symmetry, a closed symmetry line, and a quasi-disorder line. First- and second-order phase boundaries are obtained. In d=2, second-order phase transitions meeting at a bifurcation point are seen. In d=3, first- and second-order phase transitions are separated by tricritical and critical endpoints.</description>

      <title>Statistical Uncertainties of Limit Cycle Systems in Langevin Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that limit cycle systems in Langevin bath exhibit uncertainty in observables that define the limit-cycle plane, and maintain a positive lower bound. The uncertainty-bound depends on the parameters that determine the shape and periodicity of the limit cycle. In one dimension, we use the framework of canonical dissipative systems to construct the limit cycle, whereas in two dimensions, particle in central potentials with radial-dissipation provide us natural examples. We show that, the position-momenta uncertainty of particle in a central potential is larger than half the magnitude of the angular momentum (conserved) of the particle. We also investigate how uncertainties, which are absent in deterministic systems, increase with time when the systems are attached to a bath and eventually cross the lower bound before reaching the steady state.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Origin of Viscosity in 2D Simple Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in liquid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its physical origin at the individual particle kinetic level remains strongly debated. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple liquids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in all the 2D liquids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D liquids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D liquids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>Non-orthogonal eigenvectors, fluctuation-dissipation relations and entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Celebrated fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) linking the response function to time dependent correlations of observables measured in the reference unperturbed state is one of the central results in equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this Letter we discuss an extension of the standard FDT to the case when multidimensional matrix representing transition probabilities is strictly non-normal. This feature dramatically modifies the dynamics, by incorporating the effect of eigenvector nonorthogonality via the associated overlap matrix of Chalker-Mehlig type. In particular, the rate of entropy production per unit time is strongly enhanced by that matrix. We suggest, that this mechanism has an impact on the studies of collective phenomena in neural matrix models, leading, via transient behavior, to such phenomena as synchronization and emergence of the memory. We also expect, that the described mechanism generating the entropy production is generic for wide class of phenomena, where dynamics is driven by non-normal operators. For the case of driving by a large Ginibre matrix the entropy production rate is evaluated analytically, as well as for the Rajan-Abbott model for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian density fluctuations in the Dean-Kawasaki equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing analytically the $n$-point density correlations in systems of interacting particles is a long-standing problem of statistical physics, with a broad range of applications, from the interpretation of scattering experiments in simple liquids, to the understanding of their collective dynamics. For Brownian particles, i.e. with overdamped Langevin dynamics, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. In spite of the importance of this equation, its complexity makes it very difficult to analyze the statistics of the microscopic density beyond simple Gaussian approximations. In this work, resorting to a path-integral description of the stochastic dynamics and relying on the formalism of macroscopic fluctuation theory, we go beyond the usual linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, and we compute perturbatively the three-point density correlation functions, in the limit of high-density and weak interactions between the particles. This exact result opens the way to using the Dean-Kawasaki beyond the simple Gaussian treatments, and could find applications to understand many fluctuation-related effects in soft and active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Improving noisy free-energy measurements by adding more noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating free-energy differences using nonequilibrium work relations, such as the Jarzynski equality, is hindered by poor convergence when work fluctuations are large. For systems governed by overdamped Langevin dynamics, we propose the counterintuitive approach of adding noise in order to increase the precision of such calculations. By introducing additional stochastic fluctuations to the system and rescaling its potential energy, we leave the thermodynamics of the system unchanged while increasing its relaxation rate. For a given time-dependent protocol this modification reduces dissipated work, leading to more accurate free-energy estimates. We demonstrate this principle using computer simulations applied to two model systems. However, the regime of applicability of this strategy is likely limited, because it requires control of the system's potential energy in a way that is feasible in only a few experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a "maximally mixed" classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Correlation between upstreamness and downstreamness in random global value chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with upstreamness and downstreamness of industries and countries. Upstreamness and downstreamness measure respectively the average distance of an industrial sector from final consumption and from primary inputs. Recently, Antr\`as and Chor reported a puzzling and counter-intuitive finding in data from the period 1995-2011, namely that (at country level) upstreamness appears to be positively correlated with downstreamness, with a correlation slope close to $+1$. We first analyze a simple model of random Input/Output tables, and we show that, under minimal and realistic structural assumptions, there is a natural positive correlation emerging between upstreamness and downstreamness of the same industrial sector/country, with correlation slope equal to $+1$. This effect is robust against changes in the randomness of the entries of the I/O table and different aggregation protocols. Secondly, we perform experiments by randomly reshuffling the entries of the empirical I/O table where these puzzling correlations are detected, in such a way that the global structural constraints are preserved. Again, we find that the upstreamness and downstreamness of the same industrial sector/country are positively correlated with slope close to $+1$. Our results strongly suggest that (i) extra care is needed when interpreting these measures as simple representations of each sector's positioning along the value chain, as the ``curse of the input-output identities'' and labor effects effectively force the value chain to acquire additional links from primary factors of production, and (ii) the empirically observed puzzling correlation may rather be a necessary consequence of the few structural constraints (positive entries, and sub-stochasticity) that Input/Output tables and their surrogates must meet.</description>

      <title>$\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13519v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$. Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Transient subtraction: A control variate method for computing transport coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics, transport coefficients measure the sensitivity of the invariant probability measure of the stochastic dynamics at hand with respect to some perturbation. They are typically computed using either the linear response of nonequilibrium dynamics, or the Green--Kubo formula. The estimators for both approaches have large variances, which motivates the study of variance reduction techniques for computing transport coefficients. We present an alternative approach, called the \emph{transient subtraction technique} (inspired by early work by Ciccotti and Jaccucci in 1975), which amounts to simulating a transient dynamics started off equilibrium and relaxing towards the equilibrium state, from which we subtract a sensibly coupled equilibrium trajectory, resulting in an estimator with smaller variance. We present the mathematical formulation of the transient subtraction technique, give error estimates on the bias and variance of the associated estimator, and demonstrate the relevance of the method through numerical illustrations for various systems.</description>

      <title>Absorbing State Phase Transitions and Stability of Long-Range Coherence in Dissipative Quantum State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the absorbing state phase transition in a purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model where the absorbing state itself has long range phase coherence. The model may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W-state with errors. The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase. Furthermore, we argue that the long range coherence of the absorbing state leads to critical behavior distinct from Directed Percolation, the typical universality class for reaction-diffusion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active fluids generate spontaneous, often chaotic mesoscale flows. Harnessing these flows to drive embedded soft materials into structures with controlled length scales and lifetimes is a key challenge at the interface between the fields of active matter and nonequilibrium self-assembly. Here, we present a simple and efficient computational approach to model soft materials advected by active fluids, by simulating particles moving in a spatiotemporally correlated noise field. To illustrate our approach, we simulate the dynamical self-organization of repulsive colloids within such an active noise field in two and three dimensions. The colloids form structures whose sizes and dynamics can be tuned by the correlation time and length of the active fluid, and range from small rotating droplets to clusters with internal flows and system-spanning sizes that vastly exceed the active correlation length. Our results elucidate how the interplay between active fluid time/length scales and emergent driven assembly can be used to rationally design functional assemblies. More broadly, our approach can be used to efficiently simulate diverse active fluids and other systems with spatiotemporally correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Fundamental bounds on precision and response for quantum trajectory observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precision and response of trajectory observables offer valuable insights into the behavior of nonequilibrium systems. For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermo-kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of general observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser and a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>

Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as the R\'enyi index $n \to 1$ is often believed to yield the von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, earlier findings indicate that this process exhibits a singularity for the colored Motzkin spin chain problem, leading to different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. Our analytical and numerical calculations confirm this transition, which can be explained by the exponentially increasing density of states in the entanglement spectrum that we extract numerically. Disorder operators are further employed under various symmetries to study such a system. Both analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the scaling of the disorder operators also follows $\log{l}$ as the leading behavior, matching that of the R\'enyi entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant shared by both the R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators. This universal constant could potentially help capture the underlying constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>

      <title>Frustration-driven topological textures on the honeycomb lattice: antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron and skyrmion crystals emerging from spiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09547</link>

Abstract: Skyrmions -- topologically nontrivial magnetic quasi-particles -- can emerge in two-dimensional chiral magnets due to moderate or high strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. In this work, we show that the inclusion of weak next-nearest-neighbor DM interaction in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet leads to the emergence of field-induced incommensurate antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pairs and antiferromagnetic skyrmion structures. Using the Luttinger-Tisza approximation and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we report that for lower frustration values, antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pair crystal and gas phases emerge within a small magnetic field window. In these meron phases, the fundamental unit consists of a meron-antimeron pair residing on different sublattices of the honeycomb lattice, even in the gas phase, where they exhibit greater mobility. For larger frustration, a two-layer-like three-sublattice antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystal phase is stabilized over a wider magnetic field range. At lower temperatures, this region splits into two distinct antiferromagnetic skyrmion phases with skyrmions of different sizes, reflecting the influence of frustration and thermal effects on the stabilization of these topological textures. Interestingly, both meron and skyrmion low-temperature phases connect to spiral spin liquid phases of the honeycomb lattice at higher temperatures. Additionally, we analyze the emergent single-$q$ and double-$q$ phases at low temperatures, constructing a comprehensive phase diagram.</description>
