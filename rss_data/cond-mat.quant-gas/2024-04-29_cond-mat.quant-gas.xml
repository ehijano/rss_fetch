      <title>Superfluid--Bose-glass transition of disordered bosons with long-range hopping in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superfluid--Bose-glass transition in a one-dimensional lattice boson model with power-law decaying hopping amplitude $t_{i-j}\sim 1/|i-j|^\alpha$, using bosonization and the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (FRG). When $\alpha$ is smaller than a critical value $\alpha_c&lt;3$, the U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken, which leads to a density mode with nonlinear dispersion and dynamical exponent $z=(\alpha-1)/2$; the superfluid phase is then stable for sufficiently weak disorder, contrary to the case of short-range hopping where the superfluid phase is destabilized by an infinitesimal disorder when the Luttinger parameter is smaller than $3/2$. In the presence of disorder, long-range hopping has however no effect in the infrared limit and the FRG flow eventually becomes similar to that of a boson system with short-range hopping. This implies that the superfluid phase, when stable, exhibits a density mode with linear dispersion ($z=1$) and the superfluid--Bose-glass transition remains in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class, while the Bose-glass fixed point is insensitive to long-range hopping. We compare our findings with a recent numerical study.</description>

      <title>Ferrimagnetism of ultracold fermions in a multi-band Hubbard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials feature multiple electronic orbitals which are crucial to accurately understand their many-body properties, from cuprate materials to twisted bilayer graphene. In such multi-band models, quantum interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling, characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate its robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to the Heisenberg regime, and study its emergence when continuously tuning the lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin helices in the diluted one-dimensional $XX$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Possibilities for formation of the charged pion field vortices in a rotating empty vessel (in vacuum) and in the rotating pion gas with a dynamically fixed particle number at zero temperature are studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model. It is shown that in the former case at a rapid rotation a supervortex of a charged pion field can be formed. Important role played by the electric field is demonstrated. Field configurations in presence and absence of the pion self-interaction are found. Conditions for formation of the vortex lattice at the rotation of the charged pion gas at zero temperature are studied. Observational effects are discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal fragmentation in annihilation reactions with constrained kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reaction-diffusion models of annihilation reactions in low dimensions, single-particle dynamics provides a bottleneck for reactions, leading to an anomalously slow approach to the empty state. Here, we construct a reaction model with a reciprocal bottleneck on particle dynamics where single-particle motion conserves the center of mass. We show that such a constrained reaction-diffusion dynamics does not approach an empty state but freezes at late times in a state with fragmented particle clusters, and that the late-time dynamics and asymptotic density are universal. Our setup thus constitutes a minimal model for the fragmentation of a one-dimensional lattice into independent particle clusters, and we provide exact results for the final density in the large-reaction rate limit. We suggest that the universal reaction dynamics could be observable in experiments with cold atoms or in the Auger recombination of exciton gases.</description>

      <title>Hall response in interacting bosonic and fermionic ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use bosonization, retaining band curvature terms, to analyze the Hall response of interacting bosonic and fermionic two-leg ladders threaded by a flux. We derive an explicit expression of the Hall imbalance in a perturbative expansion in the band curvature, retaining fully the interactions. We show that the flux dependence of the Hall imbalance allows to distinguish the two phases (Meissner and Vortex) that are present for a bosonic ladder. For small magnetic field we relate the Hall resistance, both for bosonic and fermionic ladders, to the density dependence of the charge sitffness of the system in absence of flux. Our expression unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior in the Galilean invariant case.</description>

      <title>Analytical derivation and expansion of the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the transverse field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A defect density which quantifies the deviation from the spin ground state characterizes non-equilibrium dynamics during phase transitions. The widely recognized Kibble-Zurek scaling predicts how the defect density evolves during phase transitions. However, it can be perturbed by noise, leading to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this research, we analytically investigate the effect of Gaussian white noise on the transition probabilities of the Landau-Zener model. We apply this model to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and derive an analytical approximation for the defect density. Our analysis reveals that under small noise conditions, the model follows an anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. As the noise increases, a new scaling behavior emerges, showing higher accuracy than previously reported. Furthermore, we identify the parameters that optimize the defect density based on the new scaling. This allows for the refinement of optimized parameters with greater precision and provides further validations of previously established scaling.</description>

      <title>Loading a quantum gas from a hybrid dimple trap to a shell trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a degenerate Bose gas in a hybrid trap combining a magnetic quadrupole trap and an attractive optical trap resulting from a focused laser beam, we demonstrate the efficient loading of this quantum gas into a shell-shaped trap. The shell trap is purely magnetic and relies on adiabatic potentials for atoms in an inhomogeneous magnetic field dressed by a radiofrequency (rf) field. We show that direct rf evaporation in the hybrid trap enables an efficient and simple preparation of the cold sample, well adapted to the subsequent loading procedure. The transfer into the shell trap is adiabatic and limits the final excitation of the center-of-mass motion to below 2 micrometres.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological ordered phase for the Ising-XY Model revealed by cluster-updating Monte-Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-component cold atom systems with anisotropic hopping amplitudes can be phenomenologically described by a two-dimensional Ising-XY coupled model with spatial anisotropy. At low temperatures, theoretical predictions [Phys. Rev. A 72, 053604 (2005)] and [arXiv:0706.1609] indicate the existence of a topological ordered phase characterized by Ising and XY disorder but with 2XY ordering. However, due to ergodic difficulties faced by Monte Carlo methods at low temperatures, this topological phase has not been numerically explored. We propose a linear cluster updating Monte Carlo method, which flips spins without rejection in the anisotropy limit but does not change the energy. Using this scheme and conventional Monte Carlo methods, we succeed in revealing the nature of topological phases with half-vortices and domain walls. In the constructed global phase diagram, Ising and XY type transitions are very close to each other and differ significantly from the schematic phase diagram reported earlier. We also propose and explore a wide range of quantities, including magnetism, superfluidity, specific heat, susceptibility, and even percolation susceptibility, and obtain consistent results. Furthermore, we observe first-order transitions characterized by common intersection points in magnetizations for different system sizes, as opposed to the conventional phase transition where Binder cumulants of various sizes share common intersections. The results are useful to help cold atom experiments explore the half-vortex topological phase.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we propose an exotic quantum state which does not order at zero temperature in a Rydberg atom array with antiblockade mechanism. By performing an unbiased large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate a minimal model with facilitated excitation in a disorder-free system. At zero temperature, this model exhibits a heterogeneous structure of liquid and glass mixture. This state, dubbed quantum slush state, features a quasi-long-range order with an algebraic decay for its correlation function, and is different from most well-established quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attractor in Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin liquid in a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with nearest neighbor interactions. Based on matrix product state simulations and symmetry considerations, we find evidence that, with ferromagnetic isotropic couplings, the model realizes a chiral spin liquid, characterized by a possible $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ chiral topological order. This is supported by simulations on both cylinder and strip geometries. On infinitely long cylinders with various widths, scaling analysis of entanglement entropy and maximal correlation length suggests that the model has a gapped 2D bulk. The topological entanglement entropy is extracted and found to be in agreement with the $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ topological order. On infinitely long strips with moderate widths, we find the model is critical with a central charge consistent with the chiral edge theory of the $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ topological phase. We conclude by discussing several open questions.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity detection of large-scale atom arrays in an optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from high-resolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity ($99.971(1)\%$) and high-survival ($99.80(5)\%$) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to $399$ tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over $&gt;10000$ lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than $99.2\%$. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Spectra of correlators in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>
