      <title>Universal Scaling Laws in Freeway Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion, a daily frustration for millions and a multi-billion dollar drain on economies, has long resisted deep physical understanding. While simple theoretical models of traffic flow have suggested connections to critical phenomena and non-equilibrium universality, direct empirical validation is lacking. Using extensive, high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from the I-24 MOTION testbed, we show that traffic flow exhibits both a percolation phase transition that is self-organized critical and fluctuations consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in 1+1 dimensions. This suggests that the complex and seemingly chaotic formation of traffic jams has predictable statistical properties, which opens new avenues in traffic science for developing advanced forecasting and management strategies grounded in universal scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Machine-Precision Prediction of Low-Dimensional Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional chaotic systems such as the Lorenz-63 model are commonly used to benchmark system-agnostic methods for learning dynamics from data. Here we show that learning from noise-free observations in such systems can be achieved up to machine precision: using ordinary least squares regression on high-degree polynomial features with 512-bit arithmetic, our method exceeds the accuracy of standard 64-bit numerical ODE solvers of the true underlying dynamical systems. Depending on the configuration, we obtain valid prediction times of 32 to 105 Lyapunov times for the Lorenz-63 system, dramatically outperforming prior work that reaches 13 Lyapunov times at most. We further validate our results on Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor, a non-polynomial chaotic system that is considerably more complex than the Lorenz-63 model, and show that similar results extend also to higher dimensions using the spatiotemporally chaotic Lorenz-96 model. Our findings suggest that learning low-dimensional chaotic systems from noise-free data is a solved problem.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Husimi Representation of Chaotic Resonance States: Invariance and Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For chaotic scattering systems we investigate the left-right Husimi representation, which combines left and right resonance states. We demonstrate that the left-right Husimi representation is invariant in the semiclassical limit under the corresponding closed classical dynamics, which we call quantum invariance. Furthermore, we show that it factorizes into a classical multifractal structure times universal quantum fluctuations. Numerical results for a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and quantum maps confirm both the quantum invariance and the factorization.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Temporally-Evolving Stochastic Vibration Patterns in a Vibrating Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the observations of temporally evolving stochastic vibration patterns of a coin vibrating motor. Various voltages are applied to the coin vibrating motor, and the resulting vibrations are recorded using an accelerometer. Although an overall upward trend in mean vibration amplitude is observed with increasing drive voltage, instantaneous waveforms displayed pronounced nonlinear and quasiperiodic amplitude modulations, frequency shifts, and stochastic deviations that intensified at higher voltages. Additional experiments involving periodic pressing of the motor and the propagating medium revealed the dependence of nonlinear electromechanical responses on the initial conditions. These results demonstrate that the dynamic behaviour of the coin-type motor is governed by a complex nonlinear dependence on current and displacement, with significant implications for precision control in miniature actuator applications.</description>

      <title>Operator theoretic measures of causality from linearised dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an operator-theoretic framework Linear Operator Causality Analysis (LOCA), for analysing causality in linearised dynamical systems, focusing here on fluid flows. We demonstrate that the matrix exponential of the linearised differential equations fundamentally encodes the causal relationships between system modes at any future time. We further develop a global measure of causality that quantifies the presence and extent of global causality across all time horizons. This approach provides a physics-based alternative to statistical and information-theoretic causality measures such as Granger causality and transfer entropy. Unlike these data-driven techniques that infer causality from time-series data, LOCA leverages the linearised governing equations, yielding a more rigorous and interpretable measure of causal interactions. We show that LOCA gives equivalent results to data-driven methods under certain assumptions, and further discuss connections to key system properties such as controllability, observability, and graph-theoretic transitive closure. To complement this operator-based approach, we introduce a data-driven methodology akin to Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) that estimates causal connections directly from time series data by approximating the matrix exponential. LOCA also mitigates common issues in data-driven causality analyses, such as misleading inferences due to correlated variables or state truncation. We demonstrate our method on linearised Couette flow, demonstrating how our framework captures both direct and indirect causal interactions among flow structures. Through this example, we highlight the advantages of our approach, including its robustness to correlation-induced biases and its ability to identify causally significant modes.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck approach to wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Zakharov stationary states for weak wave turbulence involve solving a leading-order kinetic equation. Recent calculations of higher-order corrections to this kinetic equation using the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral are reconsidered in terms of stationary states of a Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian. A non-perturbative relation closely related to the quantum mechanical Ehrenfest theorem is introduced and used to express the kinetic equation in terms of divergences of two-point expectation values in the limit of zero dissipation. Similar equations are associated to divergences in higher-order cumulants. It is additionally shown that the ordinary thermal equilibrium state is not actually a stationary state of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, and a non-linear modification of dissipation is considered to remedy this.</description>

      <title>Denoising and Reconstruction of Nonlinear Dynamics using Truncated Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements acquired from distributed physical systems are often sparse and noisy. Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the primary smooth or non-smooth deterministic dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing unobserved nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters is studied in two illustrative examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire system. It is demonstrated that denoising performance improves by truncating redundant nodes and edges of the reservoir, as well as by properly optimizing hyperparameters, such as the leakage rate, spectral radius, input connectivity, and ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen and qualitatively different attractors. Compared to the extended Kalman filter, the presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios and high-frequency ranges.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>
