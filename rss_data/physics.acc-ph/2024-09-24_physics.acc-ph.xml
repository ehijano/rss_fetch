      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. I Field representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of a study of the possibility of using a homogeneous basis and a new generalization of coupled modes theory to describe inhomogeneous accelerating sections. It was shown that the single mode representation describes the electromagnetic fields with small errors in the regular part of the section. In the couplers the accuracy is worse, but it is small enough to be used in calculations. Solving the equations of generalized coupled modes theory requires calculating the derivatives of the fields with respect to various geometrical parameters. Procedures for calculating these derivatives have been developed.</description>

      <title>HOM-Damping Studies in a Multi-Cell Elliptical Superconducting RF Cavity for the Multi-Turn Energy Recovery Linac PERLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher order mode (HOM) damping is a crucial issue for the next generation of high-current energy recovery linacs (ERLs). Beam-induced HOMs can store sufficient energy in the superconducting RF (SRF) cavities, giving rise to beam instabilities and increasing the heat load at cryogenic temperatures. To limit these effects, using HOM couplers on the cutoff tubes of SRF cavities becomes crucial to absorb beam-induced wakefields consisting of all cavity eigenmodes. The study presented here focuses on a 5-cell 801.58 MHz elliptical SRF cavity designed for the multi-turn energy recovery linac PERLE (Powerful Energy Recovery Linac for Experiments). Several coaxial coupler designs are analyzed and optimized to enhance the damping of monopole and dipole HOMs of the 5-cell cavity. The broadband performance of HOM damping is also confirmed by the time-domain wakefield and the frequency-domain simulations. In addition, the thermal behavior of the HOM couplers is investigated. A comparison between various HOM-damping schemes is carried out to guarantee an efficient HOM power extraction from the cavity.</description>

      <title>Compact beam position monitor using a segmented toroidal coil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new, compact beam position monitor based on segmented a toroidal coil surrounding the charged particle beam has been investigated. It makes use of the induced voltages in the windings instead of the induced charge imbalance on capacitor plates in the conventional beam position monitors. We theoretically investigate the response of the coils to the bunched particle beam based on a lumped element model and compare it with measurements in the laboratory and in the storage ring COSY, in terms of beam displacement. As to the frequency response of the coils, we find a resonant behavior, which may be exploited to increase the sensitivity of the device further. The resolution presently achieved is about 5 micrometer in a one second time interval for a beam current of 0.5 mA.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Resonant emittance mixing of flat beams in plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear colliders rely on high-quality flat beams to achieve the desired event rate, while avoiding potentially deleterious beamstrahlung effects. Here, we show that flat beams in plasma accelerators can be subject to quality degradation due to emittance mixing. This effect occurs when the beam particles' betatron oscillations in a nonlinearly coupled wakefield become resonant in the horizontal and vertical planes. Emittance mixing can lead to a substantial decrease of the luminosity, the main quantity determining the event rate. In some cases, the use of laser drivers or flat particle beam drivers may decrease the fraction of resonant particles and, hence, mitigate emittance deterioration.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Synchrotron Radiation Studies in the EIC Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a cutting-edge particle accelerator aimed at investigating the fundamental structure of matter by colliding high-energy polarized electron beams with ions. To explore dense gluon systems and uncover the origins of nucleon mass and spin, the EIC will operate at high beam currents and luminosities. However, this approach raises beam-induced background rates, notably from synchrotron radiation (SR), which poses significant challenges to the performance and longevity of the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) general-purpose spectrometer placed at the interaction point (IP).
  This paper presents a newly developed Monte-Carlo simulation framework for accurately modeling SR backgrounds in the detector, focusing on the reflection of X-ray photons on vacuum-metal interfaces. Utilizing the extensive capabilities of Geant4 for particle-matter interactions and propagation through the geometry, the study provides first estimates of SR rates in ePIC. The results also propose countermeasures to protect sensitive electronics, ensuring stable and reliable detector operation within the EIC environment.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and focusing of multispecies ion beam using a converging laser-driven shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an ion acceleration scheme capable of simultaneously focusing and accelerating a multispecies ion beam with monoenergetic spectra to a few micron radius. The focal length and ion mean energy can be independently controlled: the former by using a different front-surface shape and the latter by tuning the laser-plasma parameters. We interpret the results using simple models and validate the results using first-principles simulations. The scheme is applicable to different laser transverse profiles and multi-ion species target, and limiting factors for the ion focusing are delineated. The generated ion beam exhibits high charge, low emittance, and high energy flux and is of interest to various applications including Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF), high flux neutron generation, and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of acceleration and rotation by interfering magnetically-launched atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present an architecture for a compact cold-atom accelerometer-gyroscope based on a magnetically launched atom interferometer. Characterizing the launching technique, we demonstrate 700 ppm gyroscope scale factor stability over one day, while acceleration and rotation rate bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s are reached after two days of integration of the cold-atom sensor. Hybridizing it with a classical accelerometer and gyroscope, we correct their drift and bias to achieve respective 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the classical ones. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our launching technique make this architecture easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>
