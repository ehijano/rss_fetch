      <title>Machine Learning based Enterprise Financial Audit Framework and High Risk Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the face of global economic uncertainty, financial auditing has become essential for regulatory compliance and risk mitigation. Traditional manual auditing methods are increasingly limited by large data volumes, complex business structures, and evolving fraud tactics. This study proposes an AI-driven framework for enterprise financial audits and high-risk identification, leveraging machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy. Using a dataset from the Big Four accounting firms (EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG) from 2020 to 2025, the research examines trends in risk assessment, compliance violations, and fraud detection. The dataset includes key indicators such as audit project counts, high-risk cases, fraud instances, compliance breaches, employee workload, and client satisfaction, capturing both audit behaviors and AI's impact on operations. To build a robust risk prediction model, three algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - are evaluated. SVM uses hyperplane optimization for complex classification, RF combines decision trees to manage high-dimensional, nonlinear data with resistance to overfitting, and KNN applies distance-based learning for flexible performance. Through hierarchical K-fold cross-validation and evaluation using F1-score, accuracy, and recall, Random Forest achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.9012, excelling in identifying fraud and compliance anomalies. Feature importance analysis reveals audit frequency, past violations, employee workload, and client ratings as key predictors. The study recommends adopting Random Forest as a core model, enhancing features via engineering, and implementing real-time risk monitoring. This research contributes valuable insights into using machine learning for intelligent auditing and risk management in modern enterprises.</description>

      <title>Portfolio optimization in incomplete markets and price constraints determined by maximum entropy in the mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solution to a portfolio optimization problem is always conditioned by constraints on the initial capital and the price of the available market assets. If a risk neutral measure is known, then the price of each asset is the discounted expected value of the asset's price under this measure. But if the market is incomplete, the risk neutral measure is not unique, and there is a range of possible prices for each asset, which can be identified with bid-ask ranges. We present in this paper an effective method to determine the current prices of a collection of assets in incomplete markets, and such that these prices comply with the cost constraints for a portfolio optimization problem. Our workhorse is the method of maximum entropy in the mean to adjust a distortion function from bid-ask market data. This distortion function plays the role of a risk neutral measure, which is used to price the assets, and the distorted probability that it determines reproduces bid-ask market values. We carry out numerical examples to study the effect on portfolio returns of the computation of prices of the assets conforming the portfolio with the proposed methodology.</description>
