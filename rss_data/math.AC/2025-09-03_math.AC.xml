      <title>On S-(h-)divisible modules and their S-strongly flat covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was proved in [3] that every h-divisible modules admits an strongly flat cover over all integral domains; and every divisible module over an integral domain R admits a strongly flat cover if and only if R is a Matlis domain. In this paper, we extend these two results to commutative rings with multiplicative subsets.</description>

      <title>Binomial edge ideals of Cameron-Walker graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Cameron--Walker graph on $n$ vertices and $J_G$ the binomial edge ideal of $G$. Let $S$ denote the polynomial ring in $2n$ variables over a field. It is shown that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) $S/J_G$ is Cohen--Macaulay; (ii) $J_G$ is unmixed; (iii) $\dim (S/J_G) = n+1$; (iv) (a) $n = 3$ and $G$ is a path of length $2$ or (b) $n = 5$ and $G$ is a path of length $4$ or (c) $n=5$ and $G$ is obtained by attaching a path of length $2$ to a triangle. Moreover, the depth of $S/J_G$ is computed for a class of Cameron--Walker graphs, called minimal dense Cameron--Walker graphs. As an application, it is proved that finite graphs $G$ with $\depth(S/J_G)=6$ can have any number of vertices~$n\geq 6$. Finally, it is shown that given integers $t,n$ with $6\leq t\leq n+1$, there exists a finite connected graph $G$ with $\depth (S/J_G)=t$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of u-S-essential submodules as a uniform S-version of essential submodules. Let R be a
  commutative ring and S a multiplicative subset of R. A submodule K of
  an R-module M is said to be u-S-essential if whenever L is a submodule
  of M such that s1(K\cap L)=0 for some s1 in S, then s2L = 0 for some
  s2 in S. Several properties of this notion are studied. The notion of u-S injective u-S-envelope of an R-module M is also introduced and some of
  its properties are discussed. For example, we show that a u-S-injective
  u-S-envelope is characterized by a u-S-essential submodule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of u-S-projective relative to a module. Let S be a multiplicative subset of a ring R and M an R-module. An R-module P is said to be u-S-projective relative to M if for any u-S-epimorphism f : M \to N, the induced map HomR(P, f) : HomR(P,M) \to
  HomR(P,N) is u-S-epimorphism. Dually, we also introduce u-S-injective relative to a module. Some properties of these notions are discussed. Several characterizations of u-S-semisimple modules in terms of these notions are given. The notions of u-S-quasi-projective and u-S-quasi-injective modules are also
  introduced and some of their properties are discussed</description>

      <title>Test Modules of Extended Rees Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a reduced, local ring $R$ and an ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of positive height, we give a decomposition of the test module, $\tau(\omega_T, t^{-\lambda})$, of the extended Rees algebra, $T =R[\mathfrak{a} t, t^{-1}]$. In particular, the degree zero component of this test module is $\tau(R, \mathfrak{a}^\lambda)$, thereby reducing the computation of test modules for non-principal ideals to the much easier case of principal ideals. Additionally, we apply our decomposition to generalize results on the $F$-rationality of Rees and extended Rees algebras [HWY02a, Conjecture 4.1],[KK21] as well as give simplified proofs of discreteness and rationality of F-jumping numbers, among other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a simple presentation by generators and relations of the ring of $\omega$-invariant symmetric polynomials over the field $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. Here, $\omega$ denotes the standard involution on the ring of symmetric polynomials, interchanging the elementary symmetric polynomials with the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. Along the way, we prove several important properties of this involution in the specific setting of characteristic 2.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of the polynomials over the spherical subalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite subgroup $W \subset \GL(\fh)$ of the linear group of a finite-dimensional complex vector field $\fh$, it is a well-studied problem to describe the structure of the symmetric algebra $B= \sym(\fh^*)$ as a representation of $G$, and also as a module over the ring of invariant differential operators under $W$ in the ring $\D(\fh)$ of differential operators on $\fh$. Since the rational Cherednik algebra $H_c(W,\fh)$ and the spherical algebra $eH_ce$ are respectively universal deformations of the ring $\D(\fh)$ and the ring $\D(\fh)^W$of $W$-invariant differential operators, we would like to build an analogy between the decomposition of modules over the invariant differential operators in \cite{ Nonk1, Nonk2, Nonk3} and the decomposition of modules over the sperical subalgebra of the rational Cherednik algebra. The ring $\D_c= eH_ce$ inherits the natural grading of $B$, and we let $\D_c^0 \subset \D_c$ and $\D_c^{-} \subset \D_c$ be subset of elements of degree 0 end strictly negative degree, respectively. Our main result is that there is for all finite reflection groups a lowest weight description of the category of $\D_c$-modules of $B$ where the ring $\Rc_c= \D_c^0 / \Dc_c^0 \cap \D_c \D_c^{-}$ plays the very important role of Cartan algebra.</description>

Abstract: We give an algorithm to compute weighted Ehrhart functions of lattice polytopes for polynomial weights using Lagrange interpolation. We show how to compute generating functions of polynomials using those of unit cubes and Eulerian numbers, and use integer programming to study the algebraic properties of the Ehrhart ring of the $d$-th unit cube. Then we show some applications to weighted Ehrhart functions and enumeration problems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Kinematics for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator Using Comprehensive Gr\"obner Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by experiments.</description>

      <title>An Effective Trajectory Planning and an Optimized Path Planning for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</description>

      <title>The singularity category as a stable module category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stabilization $\mathcal{S}$ of the module category over an artinian ring $\Lambda$ by formally inverting the tensor endofunctor given by the bimodule of relative noncommutative differential $1$-forms. It turns out that $\mathcal{S}$ is a Frobenius abelian category, which is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules over the zeroth component $L_0$ of the Leavitt ring $L$. It follows that $L_0$ is an FC ring in the sense of Damiano, which is usually not quasi-Frobenius. Moreover, the singularity category of $\Lambda$ is triangle equivalent to the stable module category over $L_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Miyashita and Varbaro classified the canonical traces of Stanley--Reisner rings that are Gorenstein on the punctured spectrum, under the Cohen--Macaulay assumption. We aim to generalize the result to the non--Cohen--Macaulay case. First, we establish an explicit formula for the canonical trace of graded fiber products of Noetherian rings and apply it to Stanley--Reisner rings of disconnected simplicial complexes. This allows us to reduce the problem to the case of connected simplicial complexes. In that case, we succeed in weakening the Cohen--Macaulay assumption in their result to the Serre's condition $(S_2)$, obtaining a similar classification. Finally, by combining these results, we provide a description of the canonical trace of a Stanley--Reisner ring satisfying $(S_2)$.</description>

      <title>Bumpless pipe dreams encode Gr\"obner geometry of Schubert polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.08370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their study of infinite flag varieties, Lam, Lee, and Shimozono (2021) introduced bumpless pipe dreams in a new combinatorial formula for double Schubert polynomials. These polynomials are the TxT-equivariant cohomology classes of matrix Schubert varieties and of their flat degenerations. We give diagonal term orders with respect to which bumpless pipe dreams index the irreducible components of diagonal Gr\"obner degenerations of matrix Schubert varieties, counted with scheme-theoretic multiplicity.
  This indexing was conjectured by Hamaker, Pechenik, and Weigandt (2022). This result establishes that bumpless pipe dreams are dual to and as geometrically natural as classical pipe dreams, for which an analogous anti-diagonal theory was developed by Knutson and Miller (2005).</description>

      <title>On normal Seshadri stratifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of a Seshadri stratification on an embedded projective variety provides a flat degeneration of the variety to a union of projective toric varieties, called a semi-toric variety. Such a stratification is said to be normal when each irreducible component of the semi-toric variety is a normal toric variety. In this case, we show that a Gr\"obner basis of the defining ideal of the semi-toric variety can be lifted to define the embedded projective variety. Applications to Koszul and Gorenstein properties are discussed. Relations between LS-algebras and certain Seshadri stratifications are studied.</description>
