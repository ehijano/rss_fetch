      <title>Fluid-structure interaction simulations for the prediction of fractional flow reserve in pediatric patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulations of blood flow in patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) have the promise to provide insight into this complex disease. They provide an in-silico experimental platform to explore possible mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, a potentially deadly complication for patients with this defect. This paper focuses on the question of model calibration for fluid-structure interaction models of pediatric AAOCA patients. Imaging and cardiac catheterization data provide partial information for model construction and calibration. However, parameters for downstream boundary conditions needed for these models are difficult to estimate. Further, important model predictions, like fractional flow reserve (FFR), are sensitive to these parameters. We describe an approach to calibrate downstream boundary condition parameters to clinical measurements of resting FFR. The calibrated models are then used to predict FFR at stress, an invasively measured quantity that can be used in the clinical evaluation of these patients. We find reasonable agreement between the model predicted and clinically measured FFR at stress, indicating the credibility of this modeling framework for predicting hemodynamics of pediatric AAOCA patients. This approach could lead to important clinical applications since it may serve as a tool for risk stratifying children with AAOCA.</description>

      <title>A Step Test to Evaluate the Susceptibility to Severe High-Altitude Illness in Field Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A laboratory-based hypoxic exercise test, performed on a cycle ergometer, can be used to predict susceptibility to severe high-altitude illness (SHAI) through the calculation of a clinicophysiological SHAI score. Our objective was to design a field-condition test and compare its derived SHAI score and various physiological parameters, such as peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and cardiac and ventilatory responses to hypoxia during exercise (HCRe and HVRe, respectively), to the laboratory test. A group of 43 healthy subjects (15 females and 28 males), with no prior experience at high altitude, performed a hypoxic cycle ergometer test (simulated altitude of 4,800 m) and step tests (20 cm high step) at 3,000, 4,000, and 4,800 m simulated altitudes. According to tested altitudes, differences were observed in O2 desaturation, heart rate, and minute ventilation (p &lt; 0.001), whereas the computed HCRe and HVRe were not different (p = 0.075 and p = 0.203, respectively). From the linear relationships between the step test and SHAI scores, we defined a risk zone, allowing us to evaluate the risk of developing SHAI and take adequate preventive measures in field conditions, from the calculated step test score for the given altitude. The predictive value of this new field test remains to be validated in real high-altitude conditions.</description>

      <title>SCIMAP: A Python Toolkit for Integrated Spatial Analysis of Multiplexed Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplexed imaging data are revolutionizing our understanding of the composition and organization of tissues and tumors. A critical aspect of such tissue profiling is quantifying the spatial relationship relationships among cells at different scales from the interaction of neighboring cells to recurrent communities of cells of multiple types. This often involves statistical analysis of 10^7 or more cells in which up to 100 biomolecules (commonly proteins) have been measured. While software tools currently cater to the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data, there remains a need for toolkits explicitly tailored to the complexities of multiplexed imaging data including the need to seamlessly integrate image visualization with data analysis and exploration. We introduce SCIMAP, a Python package specifically crafted to address these challenges. With SCIMAP, users can efficiently preprocess, analyze, and visualize large datasets, facilitating the exploration of spatial relationships and their statistical significance. SCIMAP's modular design enables the integration of new algorithms, enhancing its capabilities for spatial analysis.</description>
