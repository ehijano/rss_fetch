      <title>The Significance of Ethnomathematics Learning: A Cross-Cultural Perspectives Between Indonesian and Thailand Educators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of ethnomathematics holds significance in the pursuit of comprehending how students can grasp, express, manipulate, and ultimately apply mathematical concepts. However, ethnomathematics is also considered a complex concept in Asian countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, which can pose challenges as it needs to be comprehensively understood. This research aims to fill the gap by understanding the cross-cultural perspective of mathematics educators in Indonesia and Thailand. The participants were lecturers, teachers, and pre-service teachers. Data was gathered through questionnaires and interviews. The analytical approach involved were data reduction, data presentation, drawing conclusions or verification, and data validity. Positive responses were indicated by mathematics educators with the average scores of respondents in Indonesia at 4.77 and Thailand at 4.57. This research concludes the importance of integrating ethnomathematics in education, which is closely tied to cultural development, emphasizing the crucial role of employing comprehensive strategies in its implementation.</description>

      <title>Strategy flexibility in university mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results and ideas on flexibility and its teaching for university mathematicians based on research and our experience in professional development programs. We believe this could provide food for thought for instructors of calculus courses and beyond.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have received immense interest for their general-purpose language understanding and, in particular, their ability to generate high-quality text or computer code. For many professions, LLMs represent an invaluable tool that can speed up and improve the quality of work. In this note, we discuss to what extent they can aid professional mathematicians. We first provide a mathematical description of the transformer model used in all modern language models. Based on recent studies, we then outline best practices and potential issues and report on the mathematical abilities of language models. Finally, we shed light on the potential of LLMs to change how mathematicians work.</description>
