      <title>Constructing reducibly geometrically finite subgroups of the mapping class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider qualified notions of geometric finiteness in mapping class groups called parabolically geometrically finite (PGF) and reducibly geometrically finite (RGF). We examine several constructions of subgroups and determine when they produce a PGF or RGF subgroup. These results provide a variety of new examples of PGF and RGF subgroups. Firstly, we consider the right-angled Artin subgroups constructed by Koberda and Clay--Leininger--Mangahas, which are generated by high powers of given elements of the mapping class group. We give conditions on the supports of these elements that imply the resulting right-angled Artin subgroup is RGF. Secondly, we prove combination theorems which provide conditions for when a collection of reducible subgroups, or sufficiently deep finite-index subgroups thereof, generate an RGF subgroup.</description>

      <title>Stable cylinders and fine structures for hyperbolic groups and curve graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1995, Rips and Sela asked if torsionfree hyperbolic groups admit globally stable cylinders. We establish this property for all residually finite hyperbolic groups and curve graphs of finite-type surfaces. These cylinders are fine objects, and the core of our approach is to upgrade the hyperbolic space to one with improved fine properties via a generalisation of Sageev's construction. The methods also let us prove that curve graphs of surfaces admit equivariant quasiisometric embeddings in finite products of quasitrees.</description>

      <title>Jiggling: an h-principle without homotopical assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jiggling lemma of Thurston shows that any triangulation can be jiggled (read: subdivided and then perturbed) to be in general position with respect to a distribution. Our main result is a generalization of Thurston's lemma. It states that piecewise smooth solutions of a given open and fiberwise dense differential relation $\mathcal{R} \subset J^1(E)$ of first order can be constructed by jiggling arbitrary sections of $E$. Our statement also holds in parametric and relative form. We understand this as an h-principle without homotopical assumptions for piecewise smooth solutions of $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

      <title>Profinite rigidity of K\"ahler groups: Riemann surfaces and subdirect products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes strong profinite rigidity results for K\"ahler groups, showing that certain groups are determined within the class of residually finite K\"ahler groups by their profinite completion. Examples include products of surface groups and certain groups with exotic finiteness properties studied earlier by Dimca-Papadima-Suciu and Llosa Isenrich. Consequently, there are aspherical smooth projective varieties that are determined up to homeomorphism by their algebraic fundamental group. The main tool is the following: the holomorphic fibrations of a closed K\"ahler manifold over hyperbolic 2-orbifolds can be recovered from the profinite completion of its fundamental group. We also prove profinite invariance of the BNS invariant.</description>

      <title>Detecting Free Group Automorphisms via Virtual Homology Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_n= F\langle x_1,...,x_n\rangle$ denote the free group of rank $n\ge 2$ and let $\mathrm{End}(F_n)$ be the endomorphism monoid of $F_n$. We show that automorphisms of $F_n$ are detected via the $\mathrm{End}(F_n)$-action on the first integral homology of finite characteristic covers of the wedge of $n\ge 2$ circles $R_n$. This gives a homological characterization of homotopy equivalences of $R_n$ that we utilize to show that $\mathrm{End}(F_n)$ is asymptotically linear. We extend these results by showing that the $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$-action on the homology of iterated covers of a punctured surface $\Sigma_g^b$ of the same homotopy type as $R_n$ detects homeomorphisms of $\Sigma_g^b$ in homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of $R_n$.</description>

      <title>Maps from Grassmannians of 2-planes to projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using quaternions and octonions, we construct some maps from the Grassmannian of 2-dimensional planes of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathrm{Gr}_2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, to the projective space $\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^k$, for certain values of $n$ and $k$. All of our maps induce an isomorphism at the level of fundamental groups, and two of them are shown to be submersions. As an application, we obtain new estimates of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $\mathrm{Gr}_2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for specific values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Closed hyperbolic manifolds without $\text{spin}^c$ structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In all dimensions $n \ge 5$, we prove the existence of closed orientable hyperbolic manifolds that do not admit any $\text{spin}^c$ structure, and in fact we show that there are infinitely many commensurability classes of such manifolds. These manifolds all have non-vanishing third Stiefel--Whitney class $w_3$ and are all arithmetic of simplest type. More generally, we show that for each $k \ge 1$ and $n \ge 4k+1$, there exist infinitely many commensurability classes of closed orientable hyperbolic $n$-manifolds $M$ with $w_{4k-1}(M) \ne 0$.</description>

      <title>Detecting Free Products in the Mapping Class Group of Punctured Disks via Dynnikov Coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Dehn twists about certain $k$ curves on an $n$-punctured disk generate either a free group of rank $k$ or a free product of Abelian groups, depending on the configuration of the curves. Our approach refines previously known criteria, providing a different method for detecting freeness in the mapping class group of the punctured disk. Using Dynnikov coordinates, we further present an algorithm that checks whether Dehn twists about these $k$ curves generate a free group or a free product of Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Two optimization problems for the Loewner energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Jordan curve on the Riemann sphere can be encoded by its conformal welding, a circle homeomorphism. The Loewner energy measures how far a Jordan curve is away from being a circle, or equivalently, how far its welding homeomorphism is away from being a M\"obius transformation. We consider two optimizing problems for the Loewner energy, one under the constraint for the curves to pass through $n$ given points on the Riemann sphere, which is the conformal boundary of hyperbolic $3$-space $\mathbb H^3$; the other under the constraint for $n$ given points on the circle to be welded to another $n$ given points of the circle. The latter problem can be viewed as optimizing positive curves on the boundary of AdS$^3$ space passing through $n$ prescribed points. We observe that the answers to the two problems exhibit interesting symmetries: optimizing the Jordan curve in $\partial_\infty \mathbb H^3$ gives rise to a welding homeomorphism that is the boundary of a pleated plane in AdS$^3$, whereas optimizing the positive curve in $\partial_\infty\!\operatorname{AdS}^3$ gives rise to a Jordan curve that is the boundary of a pleated plane in $\mathbb H^3$.</description>

      <title>Positive entropy actions by higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study smooth actions by lattices in higher-rank simple Lie groups. Assuming one element of the action acts with positive topological entropy, we prove a number of new rigidity results. For lattices in $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ acting on $n$-manifolds, if the action has positive topological entropy we show the lattice must be commensurable with $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$. Moreover, such actions admit an absolutely continuous probability measure with positive metric entropy; adapting arguments by Katok and Rodriguez Hertz, we show such actions are measurably conjugate to affine actions on (infra-)tori.
  In a main technical argument, we study families of probability measures invariant under sub-actions of the induced action by the ambient Lie group on an associated fiber bundle. To control entropy properties of such measures when passing to limits, in the appendix we establish certain upper semicontinuity of fiber entropy under weak-$*$ convergence, adapting classical results of Yomdin and Newhouse.</description>
