      <title>PiKV: KV Cache Management System for Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models continue to scale up in both size and context length, the memory and communication cost of key-value (KV) cache storage has become a major bottleneck in multi-GPU and multi-node inference. While MoE-based architectures sparsify computation across experts, the corresponding KV caches remain dense and globally synchronized, resulting in significant overhead.
  We introduce \textbf{PiKV}, a parallel and distributed KV cache serving framework tailored for MoE architecture. PiKV leverages \textit{expert-sharded KV storage} to partition caches across GPUs, \textit{PiKV routing} to reduce token-to-KV access, and a \textit{PiKV Scheduling} to adaptively retain query-relevant entries. To further reduce memory usage, PiKV integrates \textit{PiKV Compression} modules the caching pipeline for acceleration.
  PiKV is recently publicly available as an open-source software library: \href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}. Experiments details is recorded at: \href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/blob/main/downstream_tasks/README.md}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/Experimental\_Results}. We also have PiKV integrated with Nvidia kvpress for acceleration, details see \href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKVpress}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKVpress}. PiKV is still a living project, aiming to become a comprehesive KV Cache management system for MoE Architectures.</description>

      <title>Kairos: Low-latency Multi-Agent Serving with Shared LLMs and Excessive Loads in the Public Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent applications utilize the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for intricate task completion through agent collaboration in a workflow. Under this situation, requests from different agents usually access the same shared LLM to perform different kinds of tasks, forcing the shared LLM to suffer excessive loads. However, existing works have low serving performance for these multi-agent applications, mainly due to the ignorance of inter-agent latency and resource differences for request scheduling. We therefore propose Kairos, a multi-agent orchestration system that optimizes end-to-end latency for multi-agent applications. Kairos consists of a workflow orchestrator, a workflow-aware priority scheduler, and a memory-aware dispatcher. The orchestrator collects agent-specific information for online workflow analysis. The scheduler decides the serving priority of the requests based on their latency characteristics to reduce the overall queuing. The dispatcher dispatches the requests to different LLM instances based on their memory demands to avoid GPU overloading. Experimental results show that Kairos reduces end-to-end latency by 17.8% to 28.4% compared to state-of-the-art works.</description>

      <title>Convergence Sans Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We currently see a steady rise in the usage and size of multiprocessor systems, and so the community is evermore interested in developing fast parallel processing algorithms. However, most algorithms require a synchronization mechanism, which is costly in terms of computational resources and time. If an algorithm can be executed in asynchrony, then it can use all the available computation power, and the nodes can execute without being scheduled or locked. However, to show that an algorithm guarantees convergence in asynchrony, we need to generate the entire global state transition graph and check for the absence of cycles. This takes time exponential in the size of the global state space. In this dissertation, we present a theory that explains the necessary and sufficient properties of a multiprocessor algorithm that guarantees convergence even without synchronization. We develop algorithms for various problems that do not require synchronization. Additionally, we show for several existing algorithms that they can be executed without any synchronization mechanism. A significant theoretical benefit of our work is in proving that an algorithm can converge even in asynchrony. Our theory implies that we can make such conclusions about an algorithm, by only showing that the local state transition graph of a computing node forms a partial order, rather than generating the entire global state space and determining the absence of cycles in it. Thus, the complexity of rendering such proofs, formal or social, is phenomenally reduced. Experiments show a significant reduction in time taken to converge, when we compare the execution time of algorithms in the literature versus the algorithms that we design. We get similar results when we run an algorithm, that guarantees convergence in asynchrony, under a scheduler versus in asynchrony.</description>

      <title>The Fused Kernel Library: A C++ API to Develop Highly-Efficient GPU Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing GPU libraries often struggle to fully exploit the parallel resources and on-chip memory (SRAM) of GPUs when chaining multiple GPU functions as individual kernels. While Kernel Fusion (KF) techniques like Horizontal Fusion (HF) and Vertical Fusion (VF) can mitigate this, current library implementations often require library developers to manually create fused kernels. Hence, library users rely on limited sets of pre-compiled or template-based fused kernels. This limits the use cases that can benefit from HF and VF and increases development costs. In order to solve these issues, we present a novel methodology for building GPU libraries that enables automatic on-demand HF and VF for arbitrary combinations of GPU library functions. Our methodology defines reusable, fusionable components that users combine via high-level programming interfaces. Leveraging C++17 metaprogramming features available in compilers like nvcc, our methodology generates a single and optimized fused kernel tailored to the user's specific sequence of operations at compile time, without needing a custom compiler or manual development and pre-compilation of kernel combinations. This approach abstracts low-level GPU complexities while maximizing GPU resource utilization and keeping intermediate data in SRAM. We provide an open-source implementation demonstrating significant speedups compared to traditional libraries in various benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of this methodology for improving GPU performance in the range of 2x to more than 1000x, while preserving high-level programmability.</description>

      <title>AerialDB: A Federated Peer-to-Peer Spatio-temporal Edge Datastore for Drone Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an unprecedented growth in research that leverages the newest computing paradigm of Internet of Drones, comprising a fleet of connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used for a wide range of tasks such as monitoring and analytics in highly mobile and changing environments characteristic of disaster regions. Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.</description>

      <title>FlashMP: Fast Discrete Transform-Based Solver for Preconditioning Maxwell's Equations on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently solving large-scale linear systems is a critical challenge in electromagnetic simulations, particularly when using the Crank-Nicolson Finite-Difference Time-Domain (CN-FDTD) method. Existing iterative solvers are commonly employed to handle the resulting sparse systems but suffer from slow convergence due to the ill-conditioned nature of the double-curl operator. Approximate preconditioners, like Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and Incomplete LU decomposition (ILU), provide insufficient convergence, while direct solvers are impractical due to excessive memory requirements. To address this, we propose FlashMP, a novel preconditioning system that designs a subdomain exact solver based on discrete transforms. FlashMP provides an efficient GPU implementation that achieves multi-GPU scalability through domain decomposition. Evaluations on AMD MI60 GPU clusters (up to 1000 GPUs) show that FlashMP reduces iteration counts by up to 16x and achieves speedups of 2.5x to 4.9x compared to baseline implementations in state-of-the-art libraries such as Hypre. Weak scalability tests show parallel efficiencies up to 84.1%.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Exploration of In-Memory Computing for Multi-Layer Perceptrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern computer architectures, the performance of many memory-bound workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph processing, databases) is limited by the data movement bottleneck that emerges when transferring large amounts of data between the main memory and the central processing unit (CPU). Processing-in-memory is an emerging computing paradigm that aims to alleviate this data movement bottleneck by performing computation close to or within the memory units, where data resides. One example of a prevalent workload whose performance is bound by the data movement bottleneck is the training and inference process of artificial neural networks. In this work, we analyze the potential of modern general-purpose PiM architectures to accelerate neural networks. To this end, we selected the UPMEM PiM system, the first commercially available real-world general-purpose PiM architecture. We compared the implementation of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in PiM with a sequential baseline running on an Intel Xeon CPU. The UPMEM implementation achieves up to $259\times$ better performance for inference of large batch sizes when compared against the CPU that exploits the size of the available PiM memory. Additionally, two smaller MLPs were implemented using UPMEM's working SRAM (WRAM), a scratchpad memory, to evaluate their performance against a low-power Nvidia Jetson graphics processing unit (GPU), providing further insights into the efficiency of UPMEM's PiM for neural network inference. Results show that using WRAM achieves kernel execution times for MLP inference of under $3$ ms, which is within the same order of magnitude as low-power GPUs.</description>

      <title>On the Efficiency of Dynamic Transaction Scheduling in Blockchain Sharding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharding is a technique to speed up transaction processing in blockchains, where the $n$ processing nodes in the blockchain are divided into $s$ disjoint groups (shards) that can process transactions in parallel. We study dynamic scheduling problems on a shard graph $G_s$ where transactions arrive online over time and are not known in advance. Each transaction may access at most $k$ shards, and we denote by $d$ the worst distance between a transaction and its accessing (destination) shards (the parameter $d$ is unknown to the shards). To handle different values of $d$, we assume a locality sensitive decomposition of $G_s$ into clusters of shards, where every cluster has a leader shard that schedules transactions for the cluster. We first examine the simpler case of the stateless model, where leaders are not aware of the current state of the transaction accounts, and we prove a $O(d \log^2 s \cdot \min\{k, \sqrt{s}\})$ competitive ratio for latency. We then consider the stateful model, where leader shards gather the current state of accounts, and we prove a $O(\log s\cdot \min\{k, \sqrt{s}\}+\log^2 s)$ competitive ratio for latency. Each leader calculates the schedule in polynomial time for each transaction that it processes. We show that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, approximating the optimal schedule within a $(\min\{k, \sqrt{s}\})^{1 -\epsilon}$ factor is NP-hard. Hence, our bound for the stateful model is within a poly-log factor from the best possibly achievable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish provably efficient dynamic scheduling algorithms for blockchain sharding systems.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Power Management on Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance prediction is essential for energy-efficient computing in heterogeneous computing systems that integrate CPUs and GPUs. However, traditional performance modeling methods often rely on exhaustive offline profiling, which becomes impractical due to the large setting space and the high cost of profiling large-scale applications. In this paper, we present OPEN, a framework consists of offline and online phases. The offline phase involves building a performance predictor and constructing an initial dense matrix. In the online phase, OPEN performs lightweight online profiling, and leverages the performance predictor with collaborative filtering to make performance prediction. We evaluate OPEN on multiple heterogeneous systems, including those equipped with A100 and A30 GPUs. Results show that OPEN achieves prediction accuracy up to 98.29\%. This demonstrates that OPEN effectively reduces profiling cost while maintaining high accuracy, making it practical for power-aware performance modeling in modern HPC environments. Overall, OPEN provides a lightweight solution for performance prediction under power constraints, enabling better runtime decisions in power-aware computing environments.</description>

      <title>Taming Cold Starts: Proactive Serverless Scheduling with Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serverless computing has transformed cloud application deployment by introducing a fine-grained, event-driven execution model that abstracts away infrastructure management. Its on-demand nature makes it especially appealing for latency-sensitive and bursty workloads. However, the cold start problem, i.e., where the platform incurs significant delay when provisioning new containers, remains the Achilles' heel of such platforms.
  This paper presents a predictive serverless scheduling framework based on Model Predictive Control to proactively mitigate cold starts, thereby improving end-to-end response time. By forecasting future invocations, the controller jointly optimizes container prewarming and request dispatching, improving latency while minimizing resource overhead.
  We implement our approach on Apache OpenWhisk, deployed on a Kubernetes-based testbed. Experimental results using real-world function traces and synthetic workloads demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 85% lower tail latency and a 34% reduction in resource usage.</description>

      <title>Perpetual exploration in anonymous synchronous networks with a Byzantine black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate: ``How can a group of initially co-located mobile agents perpetually explore an unknown graph, when one stationary node occasionally behaves maliciously, under an adversary's control?'' We call this node a ``Byzantine black hole (BBH)'' and at any given round it may choose to destroy all visiting agents, or none. This subtle power can drastically undermine classical exploration strategies designed for an always active black hole. We study this perpetual exploration problem in the presence of at most one BBH, without initial knowledge of the network size. Since the underlying graph may be 1-connected, perpetual exploration of the entire graph may be infeasible. We thus define two variants: \pbmPerpExpl\ and \pbmPerpExplHome. In the former, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of at least one component, obtained after the exclusion of the BBH. In the latter, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of the component which contains the \emph{home} node, where agents are initially co-located. Naturally, \pbmPerpExplHome\ is a special case of \pbmPerpExpl. Agents operate under a synchronous scheduler and communicate in a face-to-face model. Our goal is to determine the minimum number of agents necessary and sufficient to solve these problems. In acyclic networks, we obtain optimal algorithms that solve \pbmPerpExpl\ with $4$ agents, and \pbmPerpExplHome\ with $6$ agents in trees. The lower bounds hold even in path graphs. In general graphs, we give a non-trivial lower bound of $2\Delta-1$ agents for \pbmPerpExpl, and an upper bound of $3\Delta+3$ agents for \pbmPerpExplHome. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a black-hole variant in arbitrary networks without initial topological knowledge.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Top Resource Broker System for Split Computing: An Approach to Distribute Cloud Computing Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G network architectures will usher in a wave of innovative services and capabilities, introducing concepts like split computing and dynamic processing nodes. This implicates a paradigm where accessing resources seamlessly aligns with diverse processing node characteristics, ensuring a uniform interface. In this landscape, the identity of the operator becomes inconsequential, paving the way for a collaborative ecosystem where multiple providers contribute to a shared pool of resources. At the core of this vision is the guarantee of specific performance parameters, precisely tailored to the location and service requirements. A consistent layer, as the abstraction of the complexities of different infrastructure providers, is needed to simplify service deployment. One promising approach is the introduction of an over-the-top broker for resource allocation, which streamlines the integration of these services into the network and cloud infrastructure of the future. This paper explores the role of the broker in two split computing scenarios. By abstracting the complexities of various infrastructures, the broker proves to be a versatile solution applicable not only to cloud environments but also to networks and beyond. Additionally, a detailed discussion of a proof-of-concept implementation provides insights into the broker's actual architectural framework.</description>

      <title>Towards Lock Modularization for Heterogeneous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern hardware environments are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, leading to the emergence of applications specifically designed to exploit this heterogeneity. Efficiently adopting locks in these applications poses distinct challenges. The uneven distribution of resources in such environments can create bottlenecks for lock operations, severely hindering application performance. Existing solutions are often tailored to specific types of hardware, which underutilizes resources on other components within heterogeneous environments.
  This paper introduces a new design principle: decomposing locks across hardware components to fully utilize unevenly distributed resources in heterogeneous environments. Following this principle, we propose lock modularization, a systematic approach that decomposes a lock into independent modules and assigns them to appropriate hardware components. This approach aligns the resource requirements of lock modules with the attributes of specific hardware components, maximizing strengths while minimizing weaknesses.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Brokerless Messaging Libraries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Messaging systems are essential for efficiently transferring large volumes of data, ensuring rapid response times and high-throughput communication. The state-of-the-art on messaging systems mainly focuses on the performance evaluation of brokered messaging systems, which use an intermediate broker to guarantee reliability and quality of service. However, over the past decade, brokerless messaging systems have emerged, eliminating the single point of failure and trading off reliability guarantees for higher performance. Still, the state-of-the-art on evaluating the performance of brokerless systems is scarce. In this work, we solely focus on brokerless messaging systems. First, we perform a qualitative analysis of several possible candidates, to find the most promising ones. We then design and implement an extensive open-source benchmarking suite to systematically and fairly evaluate the performance of the chosen libraries, namely, ZeroMQ, NanoMsg, and NanoMsg-Next-Generation (NNG). We evaluate these libraries considering different metrics and workload conditions, and provide useful insights into their limitations. Our analysis enables practitioners to select the most suitable library for their requirements.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Federated Learning for Scalable Power-demand Forecasting in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of power consumption in cities and micro-grids through the Internet of Things (IoT) can help forecast future demand and optimize grid operations. But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns. Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID) data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to 1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are not scalable.</description>

      <title>On the Operational Resilience of CBDC: Threats and Prospects of Formal Validation for Offline Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information and communication technologies are by now employed in most activities, including economics and finance. Despite the extraordinary power of modern computers and the vast amount of memory, some results of theoretical computer science imply the impossibility of certifying software quality in general. With the exception of safety-critical systems, this has primarily concerned the information processed by confined systems, with limited socio-economic consequences. In the emerging era of technologies for exchanging digital money and tokenized assets over the Internet - such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) - even a minor bug could trigger a financial collapse. Although the aforementioned impossibility results cannot be overcome in an absolute sense, there exist formal methods that can provide assertions of computing systems correctness. We advocate their use to validate the operational resilience of software infrastructures enabling CBDCs, with special emphasis on offline payments as they constitute a very critical issue.</description>

      <title>CarbonScaling: Extending Neural Scaling Laws for Carbon Footprint in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents \textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are transforming industries through advanced data processing and analysis, positioning the world of DTs, Digital World, as a cornerstone of nextgeneration technologies including embodied AI. As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</description>

      <title>A Portable Multi-GPU Solver for Collisional Plasmas with Coulombic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parallel particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for low-temperature plasmas (LTPs), which discretize kinetic formulations that capture the time evolution of the probability density function of particles as a function of position and velocity. We use a kinetic description for electrons and a fluid approximation for heavy species. In this paper, we focus on GPU acceleration of algorithms for velocity-space interactions and in particular, collisions of electrons with neutrals, ions, and electrons. Our work has two thrusts. The first is algorithmic exploration and analysis. The second is examining the viability of rapid-prototyping implementations using Python-based HPC tools, in particular PyKokkos. We discuss several common PIC kernels and present performance results on NVIDIA Volta V100 and AMD MI250X GPUs. Overall, the MI250X is slightly faster for most kernels but shows more sensitivity to register pressure. We also report scaling results for a distributed memory implementation on up to 16 MPI ranks.</description>

      <title>DSperse: A Framework for Targeted Verification in Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value. We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies suited to diverse deployment needs.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Analysis of Unstructured Data with Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Privacy in Decentralized Min-Max Optimization: A Differentially Private Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized min-max optimization allows multi-agent systems to collaboratively solve global min-max optimization problems by facilitating the exchange of model updates among neighboring agents, eliminating the need for a central server. However, sharing model updates in such systems carry a risk of exposing sensitive data to inference attacks, raising significant privacy concerns. To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its advantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses challenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in non-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization problems. In this work, we propose an algorithm called DPMixSGD (Differential Private Minmax Hybrid Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel privacy-preserving algorithm specifically designed for non-convex decentralized min-max optimization. Our method builds on the state-of-the-art STORM-based algorithm, one of the fastest decentralized min-max solutions. We rigorously prove that the noise added to local gradients does not significantly compromise convergence performance, and we provide theoretical bounds to ensure privacy guarantees. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments across various tasks and models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Hop Privacy Propagation for Differentially Private Federated Learning in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, thereby enhancing privacy and facilitating collaboration among clients connected via social networks. However, these social connections introduce privacy externalities: a client's privacy loss depends not only on its privacy protection strategy but also on the privacy decisions of others, propagated through the network via multi-hop interactions. In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL mechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a multi-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes incentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their privacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling the magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked privacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the average external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and convergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive closed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium. Despite being designed from a client-centric incentive perspective, our mechanism achieves approximately-optimal social welfare, as revealed by Price of Anarchy (PoA) analysis. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves client utilities and reduces server costs while maintaining model performance, outperforming both Social-Agnostic (SA) baselines and methods that account for social externalities.</description>

      <title>EFU: Enforcing Federated Unlearning via Functional Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) algorithms allow clients in federated settings to exercise their ''right to be forgotten'' by removing the influence of their data from a collaboratively trained model. Existing FU methods maintain data privacy by performing unlearning locally on the client-side and sending targeted updates to the server without exposing forgotten data; yet they often rely on server-side cooperation, revealing the client's intent and identity without enforcement guarantees - compromising autonomy and unlearning privacy. In this work, we propose EFU (Enforced Federated Unlearning), a cryptographically enforced FU framework that enables clients to initiate unlearning while concealing its occurrence from the server. Specifically, EFU leverages functional encryption to bind encrypted updates to specific aggregation functions, ensuring the server can neither perform unauthorized computations nor detect or skip unlearning requests. To further mask behavioral and parameter shifts in the aggregated model, we incorporate auxiliary unlearning losses based on adversarial examples and parameter importance regularization. Extensive experiments show that EFU achieves near-random accuracy on forgotten data while maintaining performance comparable to full retraining across datasets and neural architectures - all while concealing unlearning intent from the server. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EFU is agnostic to the underlying unlearning algorithm, enabling secure, function-hiding, and verifiable unlearning for any client-side FU mechanism that issues targeted updates.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Syndrome Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes below the 63 $\mu$s Latency Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated decoder for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes that achieves sub-$63$ $\mu$s latency, below the surface code decoder's real-time threshold demonstrated on Google's Willow quantum processor. While surface codes have demonstrated below-threshold performance, the encoding rates approach zero as code distances increase, posing challenges for scalability. Recently proposed QLDPC codes, such as those by Panteleev and Kalachev, offer constant-rate encoding and asymptotic goodness but introduce higher decoding complexity. To address such limitation, this work presents a parallelized belief propagation decoder leveraging syndrome information on commodity GPU hardware. Parallelism was exploited to maximize performance within the limits of target latency, allowing decoding latencies under $50$ $\mu$s for [[$784$, $24$, $24$]] codes and as low as $23.3$ $\mu$s for smaller codes, meeting the tight timing constraints of superconducting qubit cycles. These results show that real-time, scalable decoding of asymptotically good quantum codes is achievable using widely available commodity hardware, advancing the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond surface codes.</description>

      <title>Fully-Fluctuating Participation in Sleepy Consensus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proof-of-work allows Bitcoin to boast security amidst arbitrary fluctuations in participation of miners throughout time, so long as, at any point in time, a majority of hash power is honest. In recent years, however, the pendulum has shifted in favor of proof-of-stake-based consensus protocols. There, the sleepy model is the most prominent model for handling fluctuating participation of nodes. However, to date, no protocol in the sleepy model rivals Bitcoin in its robustness to drastic fluctuations in participation levels, with state-of-the-art protocols making various restrictive assumptions. In this work, we present a new adversary model, called external adversary. Intuitively, in our model, corrupt nodes do not divulge information about their secret keys. In this model, we show that protocols in the sleepy model can meaningfully claim to remain secure against fully fluctuating participation, without compromising efficiency or corruption resilience. Our adversary model is quite natural, and arguably naturally captures the process via which malicious behavior arises in protocols, as opposed to traditional worst-case modeling. On top of which, the model is also theoretically appealing, circumventing a barrier established in a recent work of Malkhi, Momose, and Ren.</description>

      <title>SageServe: Optimizing LLM Serving on Cloud Data Centers with Forecast Aware Auto-Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global cloud service providers handle inference workloads for Large Language Models (LLMs) that span latency-sensitive (e.g., chatbots) and insensitive (e.g., report writing) tasks, resulting in diverse and often conflicting Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Managing such mixed workloads is challenging due to the complexity of the inference serving stack, which encompasses multiple models, GPU hardware, and global data centers. Existing solutions often silo such fast and slow tasks onto separate GPU resource pools with different SLAs, but this leads to significant under-utilization of expensive accelerators due to load mismatch. In this article, we characterize the LLM serving workloads at Microsoft Office 365, one of the largest users of LLMs within Microsoft Azure cloud with over 10 million requests per day, and highlight key observations across workloads in different data center regions and across time. This is one of the first such public studies of Internet-scale LLM workloads. We use these insights to propose SageServe, a comprehensive LLM serving framework that dynamically adapts to workload demands using multi-timescale control knobs. It combines short-term request routing to data centers with long-term scaling of GPU VMs and model placement with higher lead times, and co-optimizes the routing and resource allocation problem using a traffic forecast model and an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution. We evaluate SageServe through real runs and realistic simulations on 10 million production requests across three regions and four open-source models. We achieve up to 25% savings in GPU-hours compared to the current baseline deployment and reduce GPU-hour wastage due to inefficient auto-scaling by 80%, resulting in a potential monthly cost savings of up to $2.5 million, while maintaining tail latency and meeting SLAs.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Workflow Scheduling with Fixed Mapping and Deadline Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large data and computing centers consume a significant share of the world's energy consumption. A prominent subset of the workloads in such centers are workflows with interdependent tasks, usually represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). To reduce the carbon emissions resulting from executing such workflows in centers with a mixed (renewable and non-renewable) energy supply, it is advisable to move task executions to time intervals with sufficient green energy when possible. To this end, we formalize the above problem as a scheduling problem with a given mapping and ordering of the tasks. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time in the uniprocessor case. For at least two processors, however, the problem becomes NP-hard. Hence, we propose a heuristic framework called CaWoSched that combines several greedy approaches with local search. To assess the 16 heuristics resulting from different combinations, we also devise a simple baseline algorithm and an exact ILP-based solution. Our experimental results show that our heuristics provide significant savings in carbon emissions compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>AMPED: Accelerating MTTKRP for Billion-Scale Sparse Tensor Decomposition on Multiple GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (MTTKRP) is the computational bottleneck in sparse tensor decomposition. As real-world sparse tensors grow to billions of nonzeros, they increasingly demand higher memory capacity and compute throughput from hardware accelerators. In this work, we present AMPED, a multi-GPU parallel algorithm designed to accelerate MTTKRP on billion-scale sparse tensors. AMPED scales beyond the limits of a single GPU, meeting both the memory and performance requirements of large-scale workloads. We introduce a partitioning strategy combined with a dynamic load balancing scheme to distribute computation and minimize GPU idle time. On real-world billion-scale tensors, AMPED achieves a 5.1x geometric mean speedup in total execution time over state-of-the-art GPU baselines using 4 GPUs on a single CPU node.</description>

      <title>xDeepServe: Model-as-a-Service on Huawei CloudMatrix384</title>

Abstract: The rise of scaled-out LLMs and scaled-up SuperPods signals a new era in large-scale AI infrastructure. LLMs continue to scale out via MoE, as seen in recent models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen. In parallel, AI hardware is scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling, efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure. This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention, feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and all-to-all primitives. We also extend our serving engine FlowServe with system-level techniques, enabling scalable inference across hundreds of NPUs.</description>

      <title>OPTIMUMP2P: Fast and Reliable Gossiping in P2P Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gossip algorithms are pivotal in the dissemination of information within decentralized systems. Consequently, numerous gossip libraries have been developed and widely utilized especially in blockchain protocols for the propagation of blocks and transactions. A well-established library is libp2p, which provides two gossip algorithms: floodsup and gossibsup. These algorithms enable the delivery of published messages to a set of peers. In this work we aim to enhance the performance and reliability of libp2p by introducing OPTIMUMP2P, a novel gossip algorithm that leverages the capabilities of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to expedite the dissemination of information in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network while ensuring reliable delivery, even in the presence of malicious actors capable of corrupting the transmitted data. Preliminary research from the Ethereum Foundation has demonstrated the use of RLNC in the significant improvement in the block propagation time [14]. Here we present extensive evaluation results both in simulation and real-world environments that demonstrate the performance gains of OPTIMUMP2P over the Gossipsub protocol.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of Privacy-Fairness-Accuracy Trade-offs in Federated Learning: A Step Towards Responsible AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy; however, balancing privacy preservation (PP) and fairness poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present the first unified large-scale empirical study of privacy-fairness-utility trade-offs in FL, advancing toward responsible AI deployment. Specifically, we systematically compare Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) with fairness-aware optimizers including q-FedAvg, q-MAML, Ditto, evaluating their performance under IID and non-IID scenarios using benchmark (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) and real-world datasets (Alzheimer's MRI, credit-card fraud detection). Our analysis reveals HE and SMC significantly outperform DP in achieving equitable outcomes under data skew, although at higher computational costs. Remarkably, we uncover unexpected interactions: DP mechanisms can negatively impact fairness, and fairness-aware optimizers can inadvertently reduce privacy effectiveness. We conclude with practical guidelines for designing robust FL systems that deliver equitable, privacy-preserving, and accurate outcomes.</description>

      <title>A New One-Shot Federated Learning Framework for Medical Imaging Classification with Feature-Guided Rectified Flow and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement, and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.
