      <title>Collisionless ablative plasma shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ablative plasma shock can emanate from the interface between a cold/dense plasma and a hot/dilute ambient plasma, where the plasma mean-free-path is much longer than the temperature gradient length. The shock is driven by thermal flux from the hot plasma into the cold plasma, primarily through tail electrons mediated by an ambipolar electric field, and it propagates into the ambient hot/dilute plasma. Since the collisional mean-free-path is usually much longer than the Debye length, the ablative plasma shock is mostly collisionless, with the shock front width set by the upstream hot plasma Debye length and the shock speed by the downstream cold plasma sound speed. The shock heating of ions is extremely efficient via collisionless mixing of upstream hot ions and downstream cold ions, both of which have been converted into shock-front-bound flows accelerated by the ambipolar electric field that has a deep potential well anchored inside the shock front.</description>

      <title>Retrospective of the ARPA-E BETHE-GAMOW-Era Fusion Programs and Project Cohorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a retrospective of the BETHE (Breakthroughs Enabling THermonuclear-fusion Energy) and GAMOW (Galvanizing Advances in Market-aligned fusion for an Overabundance of Watts) fusion programs of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), as well as fusion project cohorts (associated with other ARPA-E programs) initiated during the same time period (2018-2022). BETHE (announced in 2019) aimed to increase the number of higher-maturity, lower-cost fusion approaches. GAMOW (announced in 2020) aimed to expand and translate research-and-development efforts in materials, fuel-cycle, and enabling technologies needed for commercial fusion energy. Both programs had a vision of enabling timely commercial fusion energy while laying the foundation for greater public-private collaborations to accelerate fusion-energy development. Finally, this paper describes ARPA-E's fusion Technology-to-Market (T2M) activities during this era, which included supporting ARPA-E fusion performers' commercialization pathways, improving fusion costing models, exploring cost targets for potential early markets for fusion energy, engaging with the broader fusion ecosystem (especially investors and nongovernmental organizations), and highlighting the importance of social license for timely fusion commercialization.</description>

      <title>Electrospray Thruster Plume Dynamics: Insights from Precise PP Coulomb Field Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrospray thrusters are one important type of micropropulsion systems being developed for next-generation space missions, yet the primary challenge to their operational lifespan is propellant overspray resulting from wide plume angles driven by Coulomb interactions among charged droplets. While existing models often employ truncated Coulomb field approximations, such simplifications compromise accuracy in predicting divergence dynamics. In this study, a particle-particle (PP) simulation method is used to directly calculate the interactions between droplets in an electrospray plume coupled with background electric field effects for simulation. The model integrates Boris pusher for numerical integration, validated through binary collision tests verification. Parametric analysis systematically evaluates six key variables, droplet charge, droplet mass, emission interval, droplet initial velocity, and electric field components, to quantify their impacts on plume divergence. The shape of the simulated electrospray plume and the velocity of the droplets in it are analyzed. Parametric analysis demonstrate that reducing droplet charge, increasing droplet mass, extending emission time intervals, and elevating initial drift velocity collectively reduce plume half-angle. These results quantitatively establish parameter plume relationships, providing direct guidance for thruster optimization.</description>

      <title>A Parallel-Kinetic-Perpendicular-Moment Model for Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new model for the study of weakly-collisional, magnetized plasmas derived from exploiting the separation of the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. This unique system of equations retains the particle dynamics parallel to the magnetic field while approximating the perpendicular dynamics through a spectral expansion in the perpendicular degrees of freedom, analogous to moment-based fluid approaches. In so doing, a hybrid approach is obtained which is computationally efficient enough to allow for larger-scale modeling of plasma systems while eliminating a source of difficulty in deriving fluid equations applicable to magnetized plasmas. We connect this system of equations to historical asymptotic models and discuss advantages and disadvantages of this approach, including the extension of this parallel-kinetic-perpendicular-moment beyond the typical region of validity of these more traditional asymptotic models. This paper forms the first of a two-part series on this new model, covering the theory and derivation, alongside demonstration benchmarks of this approach including shocks and magnetic reconnection. The second paper will describe our numerical scheme to solve this system along with a more comprehensive set of benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Determining Magnetic and Electric Field Generations in Laser-Driven Coil Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven capacitor coils are widely used to generate intense magnetic fields for various applications in high-energy-density physics research. Accurate measurement of the magnetic fields is essential but challenging, due to the overlapping contributions from magnetic and electric fields in proton radiography, which is the primary tool diagnosing the field generation around the coils. In this study, we systematically analyze proton radiographs obtained from laser-driven capacitor-coil targets along two orthogonal axes under various electromagnetic field conditions, including magnetic field only, electric field only, and combined electromagnetic fields. By analyzing key features in the radiographs, we distinguish and characterize the respective contributions from magnetic and electric fields. Using detailed simulations validated by experimental benchmarks, methods to isolate and quantify the magnetic field and electric field are given. The methods are successfully applied to determine the electric current and charge distribution in a double coil configuration. Our findings provide insights into improving the diagnostic capability of proton radiography, potentially leading to more accurate measurements of electromagnetic fields and enhancing the utility of laser-driven capacitor coils in high-energy-density experiments.</description>

      <title>Record Magnetic Field Generation by Laser-Driven Capacitor-Coil Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields generated by capacitor-coil targets driven by intense short-pulse lasers have been characterized using ultrafast proton radiography. A 1-kJ, 15-ps laser at a center wavelength of 1053 nm irradiated the back plate of the capacitor with an intensity of $\sim$8.3 $\times$ 10$^{18}$ W$/$cm$^{2}$, creating ultra large currents in the connecting coils. High-quality proton data obtained in the axial probing geometry show definitive signatures of magnetic field generation allowing precision measurement of the field distribution and strength. The data show a peak coil current of 150 $\pm$ 20 kA producing 250 $\pm$ 30 Tesla magnetic fields at the coil center. This sets a new record for magnetic field generation by the short-pulse-powered capacitor-coil targets.</description>

      <title>Near-axis measures of quasi-isodynamic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a number of measures and techniques to characterise and effectively construct quasi-isodynamic stellarators within the near-axis framework, without the need to resort to the computation of global equilibria. These include measures of the reliability of the model (including aspect-ratio limits and the appearance of ripple wells), quantification of omnigeneity through $\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}$, measure and construction of MHD stabilised fields, and the sensitivity of the field to the pressure gradient. The paper presents, discusses and gives examples of all of these, for which expansions to second order are crucial. This opens the door to the exploration of how key underlying choices of the field design govern the interaction of desired properties (``trade-offs''), and provides a practical toolkit to perform efficient optimisation directly within the space of near-axis QI configurations.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for warm dense matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This roadmap presents the state-of-the-art, current challenges and near future developments anticipated in the thriving field of warm dense matter physics. Originating from strongly coupled plasma physics, high pressure physics and high energy density science, the warm dense matter physics community has recently taken a giant leap forward. This is due to spectacular developments in laser technology, diagnostic capabilities, and computer simulation techniques. Only in the last decade has it become possible to perform accurate enough simulations \&amp; experiments to truly verify theoretical results as well as to reliably design experiments based on predictions. Consequently, this roadmap discusses recent developments and contemporary challenges that are faced by theoretical methods, and experimental techniques needed to create and diagnose warm dense matter. A large part of this roadmap is dedicated to specific warm dense matter systems and applications in astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion and novel material synthesis.</description>

      <title>A new class of optimized stellarators with zero bootstrap current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until now, quasi-isodynamic magnetic fields have been the only known stellarator configurations that, at low collisionality, give small radial neoclassical transport and zero bootstrap current for arbitrary plasma profiles, the latter facilitating control of the magnetic configuration. The recently introduced notion of piecewise omnigenous fields has enormously broadened the space of stellarator configurations with small radial neoclassical transport. In this Letter, the existence of piecewise omnigenous fields that give zero bootstrap current is proven analytically and confirmed numerically. These results establish piecewise omnigenity as an alternative approach to stellarator reactor design.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of stimulated Raman re-scattering in laser-plasma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental evidence of stimulated Raman re-scattering of a laser in plasma: The scattered light produced by the Raman instability is intense enough to scatter again through the same instability. Although never observed, re-scattering processes have been studied theoretically and numerically for many years in the context of inertial confinement fusion (ICF), since the plasma waves they generate could bootstrap thermal electrons to high energies [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{110}, 165001 (2013)], preheating the fuel and degrading ignition conditions. Our experimental results are obtained with a spatially smoothed laser beam consisting of many speckles, with an average intensity around $10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ and close to $10^{15}$ W/cm$^2$ in the speckles, such as those usually used in direct-drive ICF. Kinetic and hydrodynamic simulations show good agreement with the observations.</description>

      <title>Increasing the density limit with ECRH-assisted Ohmic start-up on EAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High plasma density operation is crucial for a tokamak to achieve energy breakeven and a burning plasma. However, there is often an empirical upper limit of electron density in tokamak operation, namely the Greenwald density limit $n_G$, above which tokamaks generally disrupt. Achieving high-density operations above the density limit has been a long-standing challenge in magnetic confinement fusion research. Here, we report experimental results on EAST tokamak achieving the line-averaged electron density in the range of 1.3 $n_G$ to 1.65 $n_G$,while the usual range in EAST is (0.8-1.0)$n_G$. This is performed with ECRH-assisted Ohmic start-up and a sufficiently high initial neutral density. This is motivated by and consistent with predictions of a recent plasma-wall self-organization (PWSO) theory, that increasing ECRH power or pre-filled gas pressure leads to lower plasma temperatures around divertor target and higher density limits. In addition, the experiments are shown to operate in the density-free regime predicted by the PWSO model. These results suggest a promising scheme for substantially increasing the density limit in tokamaks, a critical advancement toward achieving the burning plasma.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the rippled inner-interface-initiated ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability in laser-ablating high-Z doped targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rippled interface between the ablator and DT ice can feedout and form the perturbation seeds for the ablative Rayleigh-Taylor (ART) instability, which negatively affects direct-drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF). However, the evolution of instability remains insufficiently studied, and the effect of high-Z dopant on it remains unclear. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to calculate the feedout seeds and describe this instability. Our theory suggests that the feedout seeds are determined by the ablation pressure and the adiabatic index, while the subsequent growth mainly depends on the ablation velocity. Two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations confirm our theory. It is shown that high-Z doped targets exhibit more severe feedout seeds, because of their higher ionization compared to undoped targets. However, the X-ray pre-ablation in high-Z doped targets significantly suppresses the subsequent growth, leading to the suppression of short-wavelength perturbations. But for long-wavelength perturbations, this suppression weakens, resulting in an increased instability in the high-Z doped targets. The results are helpful for understanding the inner-interface-initiated instability and the influence of high-Z dopant on it, providing valuable insights for target design and instability control in ICF.</description>

      <title>Prediction of ELM-free Operation in Spherical Tokamaks With High Plasma Squareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict that high plasma squareness in spherical tokamaks (STs) could result in edge-localized-mode (ELM)-free H-mode. The effect of squareness on gyrokinetic and peeling-ballooning-mode width-height pedestal scalings is calculated for STs. Because STs can sustain H-mode in first ballooning stability, first-stable pedestals with lower gradients may be further from the peeling-ballooning-mode boundary and therefore naturally free of Type 1 ELMs. We show that while higher squareness destabilizes ballooning modes in first stability, the ELM stability boundary is essentially unchanged. Therefore, higher squareness could result in ELM-free discharges. Random Forest (RF) machine learning models for the gyrokinetic growth rate and distance from first stability are used to predict how squareness affects stability. A RF model with only three easily obtainable geometric inputs predicts proximity to the gyrokinetic width-height scaling on a test dataset with high accuracy, $R^2 = 0.965$.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are A-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>The effect of turbulence on the angular momentum of the solar wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01552v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer of a star's angular momentum to its atmosphere is a topic of considerable and wide-ranging interest in astrophysics. This letter considers the effect of kinetic and magnetic turbulence on the solar wind's angular momentum. The effects are quantified in a theoretical framework that employs Reynolds-averaged mean field magnetohydrodynamics, allowing for fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude. The model is restricted to the solar equatorial (\(r-\phi\)) plane with axial symmetry, which permits the effect of turbulence to be expressed in analytical form as a modification to the classic Weber &amp; Davis (1967) theory, dependent on the \(r,\phi\) shear component of the Reynolds stress tensor. A solar wind simulation with turbulence transport modeling and Parker Solar Probe observations at the Alfv\'en surface are employed to quantify this turbulent modification to the solar wind's angular momentum, which is found to be ~ 3% - 10% and tends to be negative. Implications for solar and stellar rotational evolution are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hyper Boris integrators for kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of numerical solvers for the nonrelativistic Newton--Lorentz equation in kinetic plasma simulations. The new solvers extend the standard 4-step Boris procedure, which has second-order accuracy in time, in three ways. First, we repeat the 4-step procedure multiple times, using an $n$-times smaller timestep ($\Delta t/n$). We derive a formula for the arbitrary subcycling number $n$, so that we obtain the result without repeating the same calculations. Second, prior to the 4-step procedure, we apply Boris-type gyrophase corrections to the electromagnetic field. In addition to a well-known correction to the magnetic field, we correct the electric field in an anisotropic manner to achieve higher-order ($N=2,4,6 \dots$th order) accuracy. Third, combining these two methods, we propose a family of high-accuracy particle solvers, the hyper Boris solvers, which have two hyperparameters of the subcycling number $n$ and the order of accuracy, $N$. The $n$-cycle $N$th-order solver gives a numerical error of $\sim (\Delta t/n)^{N}$ at affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Linear analysis of shear-flow instabilities in a prominence-corona interface with ambipolar diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations have shown the presence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHi) in solar prominences. Effects due to partial ionization of the prominence plasma may influence the KHi onset. We study the triggering of the KHi in an interface model that consists of a partially ionized prominence region and a fully ionized coronal region, with a uniform magnetic field parallel to the interface. There is a longitudinal flow in the prominence region. The plasma is compressible and the role of ambipolar diffusion, which accounts for collisions between charges and neutrals, is taken into account in the prominence plasma. We derive the dispersion relation of linear perturbations on the interface and analyze some limit cases analytically. Numerical results are obtained for realistic prominence parameters. We find that compressibility and gas pressure are important in determining the unstable flow velocities, specially in the range of sub-Alfv\'enic flows that are consistent with the observations. The ambipolar diffusion has a generally destabilizing influence and reduces the threshold flow velocity for the KHi onset.</description>

      <title>Merging plasmoids and nanojet-like ejections in a coronal current sheet</title>

Abstract: Forced magnetic reconnection is triggered by external perturbations, which are ubiquitous in the solar corona. This process plays a crucial role in the energy release during solar transient events, which are often associated with electric current sheets (CSs). The CSs can often disintegrate through the development of the tearing instability, which may lead to the formation of plasmoids in the non-linear phase of evolution. However, the complexity of the dynamics, and the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution due to the coalescence of the plasmoids are not fully understood. We used a resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a 2.5D current layer embedded in a stratified medium in the solar corona, incorporating field-aligned thermal conduction. Multiple levels of adaptive mesh-refined grids are used to resolve the fine structures that result during the evolution of the system. The instability in the CS is triggered by imposing impulsive velocity perturbations concentrated at three different locations in the upper half along the CS plane; this leads to the formation of plasmoids and their later coalescence. We demonstrate that a transition from purely 2D reconnection to 2D reconnection with guide field takes place at the interface between the plasmoids as the latter evolve from the pre-merger to the merged state. The small-scale, short-lived, and collimated outflows during the merging process share various physical properties with the recently discovered nanojets. The subsequent thermodynamic change within and outside the merged plasmoid region is governed by the combined effect of Ohmic heating, thermal conduction, and expansion/contraction of the plasma. Our results imply that impulsive perturbations in coronal CSs can be the triggering agents for plasmoid coalescence, which leads to the subsequent magnetic, and thermodynamic change in and around the CS.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen production from polymeric organic solids via atmospheric pressure nonthermal Plasma</title>

Abstract: The potential of using hydrogen as a sustainable energy carrier is attributed to its high energy density and its utilization without CO$_2$ emissions. Existing technologies mainly produce hydrogen thermochemically via natural gas reforming or electrochemically through water splitting. Organic solid feedstocks rich in hydrogen, such as biomass and plastic waste, are under-utilized for this purpose. Approaches based on low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma powered by renewable electricity could lead to the production of green hydrogen more viably than current approaches, leading to sustainable alternatives for upcycling plastic and biomass waste. This doctoral research dissertation focuses on the production of hydrogen from solids via atmospheric nonthermal plasma. First, two low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma reactors, based on transferred arc (transarc) and gliding arc (glidarc) discharges and depicting complementary operational characteristics, are designed, built, and characterized to produce hydrogen from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as a model plastic waste. Experimental results show that hydrogen production rate and efficiency increase monotonically with increasing voltage level in both reactors. Despite the reactors' markedly different modes of operation, their hydrogen production performance metrics are comparable.</description>

      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the "return stroke"-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed `Main pulse' shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component-type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a unique mode of charge transfer with a range of junction length-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-monoenergetic Deuteron Acceleration via Boosted Coulomb Explosion by Reflected Picosecond Laser Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generation of quasi-monoenergetic ions by intense laser is one of long-standing goals in laser-plasma physics. However, existing laser-driven ion acceleration schemes often produce broad energy spectra and limited control over ion species. Here we propose the acceleration mechanism, boosted Coulomb explosion, initiated by a standing wave, which is formed in a pre-expanded plasma by the interference between a continuously incoming main laser pulse and the pulse reflected by a solid target, where the pre-expanded plasma is formed from a thin layer on the solid target by a relatively strong pre-pulse. This mechanism produces a persistent Coulomb field on the target front side with field strengths on the order of TV/m for picoseconds. We experimentally demonstrate generation of quasi-monoenergetic deuterons up to 50 MeV using an in-situ D$_2$O-deposited target. Our results show that the peak energy can be tuned by the laser pulse duration.</description>

      <title>X-ray Thomson scattering studies on spin-singlet stabilization of highly compressed H-like Be ions heated to two million degrees Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) [D\"{o}ppner et al., Nature {\bf 618}, 270-275 (2023)] have created highly compressed hot hydrogen-like Be plasmas. Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 \AA$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.</description>
