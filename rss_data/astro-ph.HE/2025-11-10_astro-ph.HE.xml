      <title>SRGt 062340.2-265751 confirmed as a nova-like cataclysmic variable with a possible magnetic nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SRGt 062340.2-265751, a cataclysmic variable identified by SRG/eROSITA due to its significant X-ray variability, remains poorly characterised despite multi-wavelength follow-up. We present spectral and timing analyses from the first dedicated X-ray and ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton, complemented by SRG/eROSITA data from four all-sky surveys (eRASS1-4) and ASAS-SN optical photometry. Our timing analysis reveals a &gt;8$\sigma$-significant modulation at 3.6 $\pm$ 0.5 hours, likely representing the orbital period. Long-term ASAS-SN monitoring confirms the source as a VY Sculptoris-type nova-like system, while short-timescale X-ray and ultraviolet variability, down to a few minutes, suggests a possible underlying magnetic white dwarf. Two additional significant X-ray modulations at 43 $\pm$ 1 min and 36.0 $\pm$ 0.7 min tentatively point to the spin period of an intermediate polar. The best-fit XMM-Newton energy spectra reveal a multi-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ = 0.23, 0.94, and 5.2 keV), while the SRG/eROSITA spectra are consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma of a few keV. We estimate unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of $\gtrsim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.2-12 keV). Broadband spectral energy distribution modelling, from near-ultraviolet to infrared, indicates a disc-dominated system consistent with a nova-like classification. We discuss these results in the context of the source's confirmed nova-like classification and its possible magnetic nature, a scenario increasingly supported by discoveries of intermediate polars exhibiting VY Sculptoris-type nova-like features.</description>

      <title>FermiPhased: A tool for phase-resolved likelihood analysis of Fermi-LAT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope has enabled detailed studies of high-energy astrophysical sources. To support analysis, we present FermiPhased, a flexible, open-source tool for phase-resolved studies of pulsars, binaries, and other periodically variable sources. Built on the Fermipy framework, FermiPhased offers three modes: standard, adaptive (fixed counts), and joint phase-resolved analysis, enabling users to flexibly bin data based on phase, count statistics, or jointly fit different epochs of interest. FermiPhased is optimized for parallel execution and use on computing clusters. It enables parallelized extraction of phase-resolved fluxes, spectra, and intermediary data products, with tutorials and documentation available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>On the Energetic Role of Forward Neutrino Scattering in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.</description>

      <title>Detecting FRB by DANCE: a method based on DEnsity ANalysis and Cluster Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient signals exhibiting diverse strengths and emission bandwidths. Traditional single-pulse search techniques are widely employed for FRB detection; yet weak, narrow-band bursts often remain undetectable due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in integrated profiles. We developed DANCE, a detection tool based on cluster analysis of the original spectrum. It is specifically designed to detect and isolate weak, narrow-band FRBs, providing direct visual identification of their emission properties. This method performs density clustering on reconstructed, RFI-cleaned observational data, enabling the extraction of targeted clusters in time-frequency domain that correspond to the genuine FRB emission range. Our simulations show that DANCE successfully extracts all true signals with SNR~&gt;5 and achieves a detection precision exceeding 93%. Furthermore, through the practical detection of FRB 20201124A, DANCE has demonstrated a significant advantage in finding previously undetectable weak bursts, particularly those with distinct narrow-band features or occurring in proximity to stronger bursts.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of Cosmic Ray Light and Helium Spectra above 0.1 Peta-electron-Volt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a measurement of the cosmic ray helium energy spectrum in the energy interval 0.16 -- 13 PeV, derived by subtracting the proton spectrum from the light component (proton and helium) spectrum obtained with observations made by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) under a consistent energy scale. The helium spectrum shows a significant hardening centered at $E \simeq$ 1.1 PeV, followed by a softening at $\sim$ 7 PeV, indicating the appearance of a helium `knee'. Comparing the proton and helium spectra in the LHAASO energy range reveals some remarkable facts. In the lower part of this range, in contrast to the behavior at lower energies, the helium spectrum is significantly softer than the proton spectrum. This results in protons overtaking helium nuclei and becoming the largest cosmic ray component at $E \simeq$ 0.7 PeV. A second crossing of the two spectra is observed at $E \simeq$ 5 PeV, above the proton knee, when helium nuclei overtake protons to become the largest cosmic ray component again. These results have important implications for our understanding of the Galactic cosmic ray sources.</description>

      <title>LHAASO Detection of Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission toward the Giant Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray from Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is regarded as the most ideal tool to perform in-situ measurement of cosmic ray (CR) density and spectra in our Galaxy. We report the first detection of $\gamma$-ray emissions in the very-high-energy (VHE) domain from the five nearby GMCs with a stacking analysis based on a 4.5-year $\gamma$-ray observation with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) experiment. The spectral energy distributions derived from the GMCs are consistent with the expected $\gamma$-ray flux produced via CR interacting with the ISM in the energy interval 1 - 100 $~\rm$ TeV. In addition, we investigate the presence of the CR spectral `knee' by introducing a spectral break in the $\gamma$-ray data. While no significant evidence for the CR knee is found, the current KM2A measurements from GMCs strongly favor a proton CR knee located above 0.9$~\rm$ PeV, which is consistent with the latest measurement of the CR spectrum by ground-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Nature of Superorbital Modulation of SMC X-1 using NinjaSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a long-term, high-cadence timing and spectral observation of the X-ray pulsar SMC X-1 using NinjaSat, a 6U CubeSat in low-Earth orbit, covering nearly a full superorbital cycle. SMC X-1 is a high-mass X-ray binary exhibiting a 0.7 s X-ray pulsar and a non-stationary superorbital modulation with periods ranging from approximately 40 to 65 days. Its peak luminosity of $1.3\times10^{39}$~\lumcgs\ makes it a local analogue of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars powered by supercritical accretion. We find that the spin-up rate during the high state remains consistent with the long-term average, with no significant correlation between spin-up rate and flux. This result indicates that the modulation is primarily geometric rather than accretion-driven. The hardness ratio and spectral shape are stable throughout the entire superorbital cycle, supporting obscuration by optically thick material or energy-independent scattering. In addition, the 2--20 keV pulse profile varies with superorbital phase, which may be explained either by variable covering fraction due to geometric obscuration, or by free precession of the neutron star. This represents the first complete measurement of spin-up rate and spectral evolution across a single superorbital cycle in SMC X-1, highlighting the scientific capability of CubeSat-based observatories.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Energies Using LHAASO Observations of GRB221009A via DisCan Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity theories would manifest as an energy-dependent speed of light, which may potentially distort the observed temporal profile of photons from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances. The dispersion cancellation (DisCan) algorithm offers a powerful methodology for investigating such effects by employing quantities such as Shannon entropy, which reflects the initial temporal characteristics. In this study, we apply the DisCan algorithm to search for LIV effects in the LHAASO observations of GRB 221009A, combining data from both the WCDA and KM2A detectors that collectively span an energy range of $\sim 0.2-13$ TeV. Our analysis accounts for the uncertainties from both energy resolution and temporal binning. We derive $95\%$ confidence level lower limits on the LIV energy scale of $E_{\rm{QG}}/10^{19}~\text{GeV}&gt;21.1$ (13.8) for the first-order subluminal (superluminal) scenario, and $E_{\rm{QG}}/10^{11}~\text{GeV}&gt; 14.9$ (13.7) for the second-order subluminal (superluminal) scenario.</description>

      <title>Formation of millisecond pulsar-helium star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J1928+1815, the first recycled pulsar-helium (He) star binary discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, consists of a 10.55 ms pulsar and a companion star with mass $1-1.6\,M_{\sun}$ in a 0.15-day orbit. Theoretical studies suggest that this system originated from a neutron star (NS) intermediate-mass or high-mass X-ray binary that underwent common envelope (CE) evolution, leading to the successful ejection of the giant envelope. The traditional view is that hypercritical accretion during the CE phase may have recycled the NS. However, the specific mechanism responsible for accelerating its spin period remains uncertain due to the complex processes involved in CE evolution.In this study, we investigate the influence of Roche lobe overflow (RLO) accretion that takes place prior to the CE phase on the spin evolution of NSs. Our primary objective is to clarify how this process affects the spin characteristics of pulsars. We utilized the stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} and the binary population synthesis code \texttt{BSE} to model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. We calculated the distributions of the orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic field for NS + He star systems in the Galaxy. Our results indicate that RLO accretion preceding the CE phase could spin up NSs to millisecond periods through super-Eddington accretion. Considering a range of CE efficiencies $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ from 0.3 to 3, we estimate the birthrate (total number) of NS + He star systems in our Galaxy to be 9.0$\times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ (626 systems) to 1.9$\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2684 systems).</description>

      <title>The most distant optically polarised GRB afterglow: GRB 240419A at z = 5.178</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely bright phenomena powered by relativistic jets arising from explosive events at cosmological distances. The nature of the jet and the configuration of the local magnetic fields are still unclear, with the distinction between different models possibly provided by the detection of early-time polarisation. Past observations do not agree on a universal scenario describing early-time polarisation in GRB afterglows, and new studies are necessary to investigate this open question. We present here the discovery of GRB\,240419A, its redshift determination of $z=5.178$, its early-time optical polarimetry observations, and the multi-wavelength monitoring of its afterglow. We analysed three epochs of polarimetric data to derive the early-time evolution of the polarisation. The multi-wavelength light curve from the X-rays to the near-infrared band was also investigated to give a broader perspective on the whole event. We find a high level of polarisation, $P=6.97^{+1.84}_{-1.52}$\,\%, at 1740~s after the GRB trigger, followed by a slight decrease up to $P=4.81^{+1.87}_{-1.53}$\,\% at 3059~s. On the same timescale, the polarisation position angle is nearly constant. The multi-band afterglow at the time of the polarisation measurements is consistent with a forward shock (FS), while the earlier evolution at $t-t_0\lesssim700$ s can be associated with the interplay between the forward and the reverse shocks or with energy injection. The detected polarised radiation when the afterglow is FS-dominated and the stable position angle are consistent with an ordered magnetic field plus a turbulent component driven by large-scale magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. The lack of a jet break in the light curve prevents a comparison of the polarisation temporal evolution with theoretical expectations from magnetic fields amplified by microscopic-scale turbulence, limiting ...</description>

      <title>Searching for Electromagnetic Counterpart Candidates to GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of GW231123, a gravitational-wave (GW) event with exceptionally massive and rapidly spinning black holes, suggests the possible formation within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, which provides a favorable environment for potentially generating an observable electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We conduct a search for such a counterpart by crossmatching the GW localization with a comprehensive catalog of AGN flares from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Our analysis yields six plausible optical flare candidates that are spatially and temporally coincident with GW231123 and exhibit significant deviations from their AGN baseline flux. Although these candidates represent a crucial first step, their true nature remains inconclusive. Confirming any one of these flares via future observations would provide a landmark validation of the AGN formation channel and unlock the multi-messenger potential of this extraordinary merger.</description>

      <title>A Mass-Independent Damping Timescale in Black Hole Accretion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling laws reveal the underlying structural similarities shared by astrophysical systems across vastly different scales. In black hole accretion systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales (CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the underlying physical structure of accretion disks. We investigate, for the first time, the long-term hard X-ray variability of black hole and neutron star accretion systems using light curves from the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope 157-month catalog. Applying a damped random walk model, we measure CDTs for 39 Seyfert galaxies, 17 blazars, 82 X-ray binaries, and one tidal disruption event. Unexpectedly, these CDTs span months to years but with a mass-independent feature, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from disk--corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the disk--corona--jet connection.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of PeV Cosmic-Ray Protons and Helium Nuclei with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Observatory comprises a cubic-kilometer particle detector deep in the Antarctic ice and the cosmic-ray air-shower array IceTop at the surface above. Previous analyses of the cosmic-ray composition have used coincident events with IceTop detecting the electromagnetic shower footprint as well as GeV muons, while the sensors submerged in the ice measure the TeV muons from the same events. The energy range of previous composition analyses, however, has been limited to 3 PeV primary energy and above, whereas the IceTop all-particle energy spectrum has been extended down to 250 TeV. This contribution presents a method to reconstruct the combined spectrum of cosmic-ray protons and helium nuclei, starting at 200 TeV primary energy.

      <title>A subpopulation of low-mass, spinning black holes: signatures of dynamical assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of massive, rapidly spinning binary black holes mergers provide increasing evidence for the dynamical origin of some mergers. Previous studies have interpreted the mergers with primary mass $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ as being dominated by hierarchical, second-generation mergers, with rapidly spinning primaries being the products of previous black hole mergers assembled in dense stellar clusters. In this work, we reveal confident evidence of another subpopulation with rapid and isotropic spins at low mass containing the two exceptional events GW241011 and GW241110, consistent with a hierarchical merger hypothesis. Our result suggests the mass distribution of the second-generation black holes is peaked at low primary masses of $\sim16\,M_\odot$ rather than $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ in the pair-instability gap. Such low-mass second-generation black holes must be formed from the merger of even lighter first-generation black holes, implying that dense, metal-rich stellar environments contribute to the binary black hole population. By separating the contamination of higher-generation black holes, our result reveals the primary mass distribution of first-generation black holes formed from stellar collapse, which shows a significant dip between $\sim12\,M_\odot$ to $\sim20\,M_\odot$. This may indicate a dearth of black holes due to variation in the core compactness of the progenitor.</description>

      <title>Charge-dependent spectral softenings of primary cosmic-rays from proton to iron below the knee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05409v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most particle acceleration mechanisms, the maximum energy of the cosmic rays can achieve is charge dependent. However, the observational verification of such a fundamental relation is still lack due to the difficulty of measuring the spectra of individual particles from one (kind of) source(s) up to very high energies. This work reports direct measurements of the carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra from ~ 20 gigavolts to ~ 100 teravolts (~ 60 teravolts for iron) with 9 years of on-orbit data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE). Distinct spectral softenings have been directly detected in these spectra for the first time. Combined with the updated proton and helium spectra, the spectral softening appears universally at a rigidity of ~ 15 teravolts. A nuclei mass dependent softening is rejected at a confidence level of &gt; 99.999%. Taking into account the correlated structures at similar energies in the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays, one of the most natural interpretations of the spectral structures is the presence of a nearby cosmic ray source. In this case, the softening energies correspond to the acceleration upper limits of such a source, forming the so-called Peters cycle of the spectra. The results thus offer observational verification of the long-standing prediction of the charge-dependent energy limit of cosmic ray acceleration.</description>

      <title>Crossing the veil of the brightest radio relic in the sky MACS J0717.6+3745</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-frequency, full-polarisation Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) radio data at X-band of the radio relic: MACS J0717.5+3745. Radio relics trace shock waves in the intracluster medium (ICM) produced during mergers. Understanding the physical characteristics of relics is important for determining their nature, whether for example they are thermal ICM electrons that are accelerated, or whether they are fossil electrons re-accelerated by a merger event. Radio spectropolarimetric analysis, such as the Stokes QU-fitting, provides a diagnostic of the nature and structure of the magnetized plasma internal or external to the source, with important implications for theoretical models. The high-frequency polarisation analysis presented here shows, for the first time, a change in the magneto-ionic structure compared to the low-frequency data available in the literature. These high-frequency, polarised data could be interpreted also with an internal depolarisation behaviour and this new finding may be used to investigate possible particle acceleration mechanism. If that is true, the change in the behaviour of the polarised signal could be tracing physical properties of a population of non-thermal particles that are undergoing to a re-acceleration of particles in the relic by large-scale internal shocks of Active Galactic Nuclei jet fossil particles ejected from the central Narrow Angle Tail radio galaxy. New upcoming broad-band VLA X- and Ku-bands data will clarify this. Finally, we conclude that high-frequency, high-sensitive, spectropolarimetric radio data should be explored further, as they can effectively trace shock fronts and thereby provide insights into the intrinsic magneto-ionic properties of radio components.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution and Kilonova Implications of Post-Merger Accretion Disk Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several gamma ray bursts have recently been associated with a kilonova emission. We study the mechanisms which could account for this effect, by means of radioactive decay of elements synthesized in accretion disk wind. We model the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and also be the sites of efficient nucleosynthesis of Lanthanides.</description>

      <title>Heavy black hole seed survivors in dwarf galaxies: a case study of Leo I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $M_\bullet &gt; 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot$ hosted by high-redshift galaxies have challenged our understanding of black hole formation and growth, as several pathways have emerged attempting to explain their existence. The "heavy-seed" pathway eases the problem with the progenitors of these SMBHs having birth masses up to ${\sim} 10^5~{\rm M_\odot}$. Here, we investigate the possibility that a local dwarf galaxy, Leo I, harbors a heavy-seed descendant. Using Monte-Carlo merger trees to generate the merger histories of 1,000 dark matter halos similar to the Milky Way (MW; with a mass of ${\sim} 10^{12}~{\rm M_\odot}$ at redshift $z{=}0$). We search for Leo-like satellite halos among these merger trees, and investigate the probability that the progenitors of some of these satellites formed a heavy seed. We derive the likelihood of such "heavy seed survivors" (HSSs) across various formation and survival criteria as well as Leo-similarity criteria. We find that the virial temperature for the onset of atomic cooling and rapid gas infall that yields heavy seeds, $T_{\rm act}$, has the largest impact on the number of HSSs. We find HSSs in a fraction $0.7\%$, $18.1\%$, and $96.5\%$ of MW-like halos when $T_{\rm act}$ is set to $9,000$K, $7,000$K, and $5,000$K respectively. This suggests that Leo I could be hosting a heavy seed and could provide an opportunity to disentangle heavy seeds from other SMBH formation mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low mass particles with small electric charges can be produced abundantly in large electric fields via the Schwinger effect. We study the production rate of such particles inside the polar gap of nearby pulsars. After production they are accelerated above MeV energies by the local electric fields. These pulsar-produced millicharged particles can be detected at Earth in low-threshold dark matter direct detection experiments. We find that the current XENONnT data constrains millicharged particles produced in the Crab pulsar to have charges less than $O(10^{-6})$ for sub-eV masses.</description>

      <title>SCATTER Common Envelope Formalism for Triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many stars are components of triple-star systems, or of higher-order multiples. In such systems mass transfer is common, and when the transfer is dynamically unstable, a common envelope forms. As such, it is important to be able to compute the post-common-envelope orbital separations among the various stars comprising the system, and to determine whether the common envelope induces mergers and/or makes later mergers inevitable. In this paper we compute the results of common-envelope evolution for triples. We employ the SCATTER formalism, a new approach to the computation of post-common-envelope separations. This work has applications to gravitational mergers, Type Ia supernovae, and a broad range of highly energetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an X-ray Luminous Radio-Loud Quasar at $z=3.4$: A Possible Transitional Super-Eddington Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the multiwavelength properties of eFEDS J084222.9+001000 (hereafter ID830), a quasar at $z=3.4351$, identified as the most X-ray luminous radio-loud quasar in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field. ID830 shows a rest-frame 0.5-2 keV luminosity of $\log (L_\mathrm{0.5-2\,keV}/\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 46.20 \pm 0.12$, with a steep X-ray photon index ($\Gamma =2.43 \pm 0.21$), and a significant radio counterpart detected with VLA/FIRST 1.4 GHz and VLASS 3 GHz bands. The rest-frame UV to optical spectra from SDSS and Subaru/MOIRCS $J$-band show a dust reddened quasar feature with $A_\mathrm{V} = 0.39 \pm 0.08$ mag and the expected bolometric AGN luminosity from the dust-extinction-corrected UV luminosity reaches $L_\mathrm{bol,3000}= (7.62 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We estimate the black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH} = (4.40 \pm 0.72) \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ based on the MgII$\lambda$2800 emission line width, and an Eddington ratio from the dust-extinction-corrected UV continuum luminosity reaches $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd,UV}=1.44 \pm 0.24$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{Edd,X}} = 12.8 \pm 3.9$ from the X-ray luminosity, both indicating the super-Eddington accretion. ID830 shows a high ratio of UV-to-X-ray luminosities, $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.20 \pm 0.07$ (or $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.42 \pm 0.07$ after correcting for jet-linked X-ray excess), higher than quasars and little red dots in super-Eddington phase with similar UV luminosities, with $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}&lt;-1.8$. Such a high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ suggests the coexistence of a prominent radio jet and X-ray corona, in this high Eddington accretion phase. We propose that ID830 may be in a transitional phase after an accretion burst, evolving from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington state, which could naturally describe the high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are known to be mainly of extragalactic origin, and their propagation is limited by energy losses, so their arrival directions are expected to correlate with the large-scale structure of the local Universe. In this work, we investigate the possible presence of intermediate-scale excesses in the flux of the most energetic cosmic rays from the direction of the supergalactic plane region using events with energies above 20 EeV recorded with the surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory up to 31 December 2022, with a total exposure of 135,000 km^2 sr yr. The strongest indication for an excess that we find, with a post-trial significance of 3.1{\sigma}, is in the Centaurus region, as in our previous reports, and it extends down to lower energies than previously studied. We do not find any strong hints of excesses from any other region of the supergalactic plane at the same angular scale. In particular, our results do not confirm the reports by the Telescope Array collaboration of excesses from two regions in the Northern Hemisphere at the edge of the field of view of the Pierre Auger Observatory. With a comparable integrated exposure over these regions, our results there are in good agreement with the expectations from an isotropic distribution.</description>

      <title>Search for a diffuse flux of photons with energies above tens of PeV at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse photons of energy above 0.1 PeV, produced through the interactions between cosmic rays and either interstellar matter or background radiation fields, are powerful tracers of the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the measurement of a diffuse photon flux would be an important probe to test models of super-heavy dark matter decaying into gamma-rays. In this work, we search for a diffuse photon flux in the energy range between 50 PeV and 200 PeV using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. For the first time, we combine the air-shower measurements from a 2 km$^2$ surface array consisting of 19 water-Cherenkov surface detectors, spaced at 433 m, with the muon measurements from an array of buried scintillators placed in the same area. Using 15 months of data, collected while the array was still under construction, we derive upper limits to the integral photon flux ranging from 13.3 to 13.8 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above tens of PeV. We extend the Pierre Auger Observatory photon search program towards lower energies, covering more than three decades of cosmic-ray energy. This work lays the foundation for future diffuse photon searches: with the data from the next 10 years of operation of the Observatory, this limit is expected to improve by a factor of $\sim$20.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-disk Collisions for Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test \textbf{the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions} by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Jet-environment interaction after delayed collapse in binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, where the collapse of the metastable massive neutron star (MNS) remnant leads to the production of an incipient jet having terminal Lorentz factor and Poynting-flux luminosity compatible with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB). We consider different MNS lifetimes of about 25 and 50 ms, long enough for massive polar outflows to emerge before black hole (BH) formation. The interaction of the following BH-driven jet with such polar outflows, responsible for shock heating and possible electromagnetic signatures, is self-consistently captured for the first time. Exploiting an unprecedentedly low numerical density floor scaling as r^-6, we explore the jet propagation up to distances of ~10^4 km. Comparing the outcome of different MNS lifetimes, we find that the latter, by strongly affecting the propagation environment, plays a major role in determining the final properties of the escaping jet. Finally, we consider a non-collapsing case, where the MNS-driven outflow is found too dense and slow to be compatible with a GRB jet, thus favoring a BH central engine scenario.</description>

      <title>On the Efficiency of Producing Gamma-Ray Bursts from Isolated Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars is not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial mass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. Some massive ($M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim20M_\odot$) Pop III stars are expected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power a GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova star imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an accretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial rotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during its chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\leq M_{\rm ZAMS}/M_\odot \leq 100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\leq \Omega_0/\Omega_{\rm crit}\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss ensues for $\Omega&gt;\Omega_{\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\eta_{\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop III GRB production efficiency is $\eta_{\rm GRB}\sim10^{-5}-3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\sim2-40\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ by \textit{Swift}, with 75\% of the GRBs located at $z\lesssim8$. If the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\eta_{\rm wind}&gt;0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favors a binary scenario instead.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the progenitor and explosion of SN 2024ggi in harmony with pre-explosion detection and hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 2024ggi is a nearby Type II SN discovered by ATLAS, showing early flash-ionization features. The pre-explosion images reveal a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor with an initial mass of 10-17 M$_\odot$. In the present work, we perform detailed hydrodynamic modeling to refine and put robust constraints on the progenitor and explosion parameters of SN 2024ggi. Among the progenitor models in our study, the pre-SN properties of the 11 M$_{\odot}$ match the pre-explosion detected progenitor well. However, we find it difficult to completely rule out the 10 M$_{\odot}$ and 12 M$_{\odot}$ models. Thus, we provide a constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass of the progenitor. To match the observed bolometric light curve and velocity evolution of SN 2024ggi, the favored model with an initial mass of 11 M$_{\odot}$ has a pre-SN radius of 800 R$_{\odot}$. This model requires an explosion energy of [0.7-0.8]$\times$10$^{51}$ erg, nickel mass of 0.049 M$_{\odot}$, ejecta mass of 9.1 M$_{\odot}$, and an amount of $\sim$ 0.5 M$_{\odot}$ of steady-wind CSM extended up to $\sim1.2\times10^{14}$ cm resulting from an eruptive mass-loss rate of 1.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also incorporate the accelerated-wind CSM scenario, which suggests a mass-loss rate of 1.0$\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a CSM mass of $\sim$ 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ extended up to $\sim1.1\times10^{14}$ cm. This mass-loss rate falls within the range constrained observationally. Additionally, due to the constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass, the range of pre-SN radius and ejecta mass would be [690-900] R$_{\odot}$, and [8.2-9.6] M$_{\odot}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBR\'I, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.</description>

Abstract: Based on an extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model, we investigate the properties of non-accreted crusts of young and warm neo-neutron stars, i.e., of finite-temperature inhomogeneous dense matter in beta equilibrium. An interesting feature is the appearance, in the deep inner crust, of an extensive and almost pure layer of neutron-rich light nuclei that extends up to the density of the transition to homogeneous matter. Most probably, this layer emerges due to translational degrees of freedom of the nuclei. If confirmed, it will significantly impact the transport and elastic properties of the crust and its crystallization process. Then, we demonstrate that our inner crust is stable with respect to the diffusion of ions, which is in contrast with some of the predictions made in the literature for cold crusts. Finally, we show that clusterization completely exhausts the density instabilities that affect sub-saturated nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, we investigate the bright ring features and polarization structures in images of the Kerr-Sen black hole associated with Sgr A*, as illuminated by 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Our findings reveal that an increase in the dilaton parameter leads to a shrinking of the bright ring, accompanied by enhancements in both its width and brightness. As the disk thickness grows, the bright ring's diameter and width both decrease. The brightness enhancement induced by the disk thickness is less prominent than that driven by the dilaton parameter. Comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters, and find that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observer's inclination. Furthermore, we analyze the coefficient $\beta_2$ to probe the polarization structure of the black hole images, and reveal that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <title>AppleCiDEr II: SpectraNet -- A Deep Learning Network for Spectroscopic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have opened a new frontier in the discovery and characterization of transients. While photometric light curves provide broad temporal coverage, spectroscopic observations remain crucial for physical interpretation and source classification. However, existing spectral analysis methods -- often reliant on template fitting or parametric models -- are limited in their ability to capture the complex and evolving spectra characteristic of such sources, which are sometimes only available at low resolution. In this work, we introduce SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network designed to learn robust representations of optical spectra from transients. Our model combines multi-scale convolution kernels and multi-scale pooling to extract features from preprocessed spectra in a hierarchical and interpretable manner. We train and validate SpectraNet on low-resolution time-series spectra obtained from the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) and other instruments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in classification. Furthermore, in redshift prediction tasks, SpectraNet achieves a root mean squared relative redshift error of 0.02, highlighting its effectiveness in precise regression tasks as well.</description>
