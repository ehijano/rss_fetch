      <title>Optical characterization of deep level defects in n-type Al$_x$In$_y$Ga$_{1-x-y}$P for development of solid-state photomultiplier analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing intrinsic defects is an important step in evaluating materials for new optoelectronic device applications. For photomultipliers, suppressing dark currents is critical, but there exists a tradeoff between maximizing the band gap while remaining sensitive to the wavelength of interest, and minimizing the incorporation of new defects by growing not-yet-optimized alloys. We present a series of capacitance-based measurements, including deep level optical spectroscopy, steady-state photocapacitance and illuminated capacitance-voltage, on photodiodes with lightly \textit{n}-type Al$_x$In$_y$Ga$_{1-x-y}$P absorber regions. Several deep levels are identified, including one near midgap. While the inclusion of aluminum increases each trap density by approximately 10x, the hole capture cross section also appears to decrease, suggesting that Shockley-Read-Hall dark currents may be suppressed. These materials may be good candidates for development into silicon photomultiplier analogs with wider bandgap for scintillator applications.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of excitonic transitions to temperature in monolayers of TMD alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer tunable optical and electronic properties, making them highly promising for next-generation optoelectronic devices. One effective approach to engineering these properties is through alloying, which enables continuous control over the bandgap energy and excitonic transitions. In this study, we perform temperature-dependent transmission spectroscopy on monolayers of Mo1-xWxS2 and Mo(S1-xSex)2 alloys, transferred onto the core of an optical fiber and measured within a cryostat over a temperature range of 20-320 K. The use of an all-fiber configuration allowed us to probe interband transitions A, B, and C with high stability and precision. We observe a systematic redshift of excitonic transitions with increasing Se content, and a blueshift when Mo is replaced with W. These spectral shifts correlate with alloy composition and enable the tuning of bandgap energies between 1.6 eV and 2.0 eV at room temperature. Furthermore, we analyze the temperature sensitivity of the excitonic transitions, revealing that Se incorporation enhances thermal response in a non-monotonic manner, while W substitution results in a more monotonic and stronger temperature dependence. The splitting between A and B transitions, associated with spin-orbit coupling, also varies with composition. Our findings underscore the potential of compositional engineering in 2D TMD alloys to achieve both spectral and thermal control of optical properties, relevant for the design of robust and tunable optoelectronic systems.</description>

      <title>Shake-Table Tests of a Three-Storey Steel Structure with Resilient Slip-Friction Joints (RSFJ)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shake-table tests were conducted as part of the Robust Building Systems (ROBUST) program to evaluate and demonstrate the resilience of various structural concepts under earthquake excitations. This paper presents the results of 3 different configurations incorporating the Resilient Slip-Friction Joint (RSFJ) in: (1) tension-only braces (TOB), (2) tension-compression braces (TCB), and (3) moment-resisting frame (MRF) joints along the longitudinal direction. Each building configuration was subjected to the El Centro ground motion at increasing intensities, reaching a peak ground acceleration (PGA) of about 0.5 g. The peak displacements sustained were well within design values, with the top floor deflecting by 0.66%, 0.98% and 1.26% of the total height for the TOB, TCB and MRF systems respectively. The corresponding inter-storey drifts peaked at 0.87%, 1.11% and 1.62%. In all cases, the structures essentially self-centered with residual drifts limited to 0.03%. The floor accelerations observed in unidirectional tests were 0.67 g (TOB), 0.66 g (TCB) and 0.62 g (MRF). The spikes may occur during (a) direction reversal at peak Mode 1 amplitude, (b) under the influence of higher Mode 2, and/or (c) stiffness transition at the upright/plumb position. In bidirectional tests, torsion effects contributed to the largest acceleration recorded at 0.95 g (TCB). Unbalanced resistance/deformation of symmetric friction connections in the transverse direction led to the structure twisting and loading the longitudinal RSFJs unevenly. However, the effects on peak displacements were not significant and similar responses as unidirectional tests indicate effective performance under simultaneous out-of-plane shaking. The results demonstrate the RSFJ's ability to damp seismically induced vibrations and restore structures to their original, undeformed shape after earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Octupole-driven spin-transfer torque switching of all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferromagnets are canonical devices in spintronics, with wide-ranging applications in data storage, computing, and sensing. They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of magnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and reciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through spin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects could be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials, since they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral antiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment, which are manifestations of their spin-split band structure. However, the reciprocal effect, i.e., the antiferromagnetic counterpart of STT driven by currents through the AFMTJ, has been assumed non-existent due to the total electric current being spin-neutral. Here, in contrast to this common expectation, we report nanoscale AFMTJs exhibiting this reciprocal effect, which we term octupole-driven spin-transfer torque (OTT). We demonstrate current-induced OTT switching of PtMn3|MgO|PtMn3 AFMTJs, fabricated on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate, exhibiting a record-high TMR value of 363% at room temperature and switching current densities of the order of 10 MA/cm2. Our theoretical modeling explains the origin of OTT in terms of the imbalance between intra- and inter-sublattice spin currents across the AFMTJ, and equivalently, in terms of the non-zero net cluster octupole polarization of each PtMn3 layer. This work establishes a new materials platform for antiferromagnetic spintronics and provides a pathway towards deeply scaled magnetic memory and room-temperature terahertz technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.</description>

      <title>Tailored Thermal Transport in Phase Change Materials-Based Nanocomposites through Interfacial Structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial thermal transport is a critical bottleneck in nanoscale systems, where heat dissipation and energy efficiency are strongly modulated by molecular ordering at solid-liquid boundaries. Here, using atomistic simulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal how interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density distribution and thermal transport across the interface. At flat and mildly curved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting efficient heat transfer, which is enhanced with increasing contact surface area. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to interference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized depletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase in interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept constant. By decomposing the interface into convex ("hill" of solid) and concave ("valley" of solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently offer lower thermal resistance. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow. Remarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy losses scale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area, the entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting curvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment. These findings unveil a direct link between surface geometry, thermodynamic dissipation, and heat transport, offering new design principles for thermally tunable nanostructured materials, thermal interface coatings, and phase-change systems.</description>

      <title>Four-channel Imaging Based on Reconfigurable Metasurfaces: Hyperchaotic Encryption under Physical Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces facilitate high-capacity optical information integration by simultaneously supporting near-field nanoprinting and far-field holography on a single platform. However, conventional multi-channel designs face critical security vulnerabilities for sensitive information due to insufficient encryption mechanisms. In this work, we propose a four-channel phase-change metasurface featuring algorithm-physical co-security-a dual-protection framework combining intrinsic metasurface physical security with chaotic encryption. Our polarization-multiplexed metasurface generates four optical imaging channels through meta-atom design, including two far-field holograms and two near-field patterns. To enhance system security, we apply Chen hyperchaotic encryption combined with the Logistic map and DNA encoding to convert near-field information into secure QR codes; far-field holograms are retained to demonstrate the metasurface's information capacity and for attack detection. Phase-change metasurface further provides physical-layer security by dynamically switching imaging channels via crystalline-to-amorphous state transitions, enhancing anti-counterfeiting and reliability. The proposed metasurface achieves high-fidelity imaging, robust anti-attack performance, and independent channel control. This integrated approach pioneers a secure paradigm for high-density optical information processing.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency microwave photodetection by cavity coupled double dots with single cavity-photon sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a superconducting cavity-coupled double quantum dot (DQD) photodiode that achieves a maximum photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25% in the microwave domain. With a higher-quality-factor cavity and improved device design to prevent photon leakages through unwanted pathways, our device measures microwave signals down to 100 aW power level and achieves sensitivity to probe microwave signals with one photon at a time in the cavity. We analyze the photodiode operation using Jaynes-Cummings input-output theory, identifying the key improvements of stronger cavity-DQD coupling needed to achieve near-unity photodetection efficiency. The results presented in this work represent a crucial advancement toward near unity microwave photodetection efficiency with single cavity-photon sensitivity for studies of photon statistics in the microwave range and applications related to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Particle, kinetic and hydrodynamic models for sea ice floes. Part I: Non-rotating floes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive modeling framework for the dynamics of sea ice floes using particle, kinetic, and hydrodynamic approaches. Building upon the foundational work of Ha and Tadmor on the Cucker-Smale model for flocking, we derive a Vlasov-type kinetic formulation and a corresponding hydrodynamic description. The particle model incorporates essential physical properties of sea ice floes, including size, position, velocity, and interactions governed by Newtonian mechanics. By extending these principles, the kinetic model captures large-scale features through the phase-space distribution, and we also present a hydrodynamic model using the velocity moments and a suitable closure condition. In this paper, as an idea-introductory step, we assume that ice floes are non-rotating and focus on the linear velocity dynamics. Our approach highlights the role of contact forces, ocean drag effects, and conservation laws in the multiscale description of sea ice dynamics, offering a potential pathway for the improved understanding and prediction of sea ice behaviors in changing climatic conditions.</description>

      <title>Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

Abstract: Atom interferometer (AI)-based dynamic gravimeter enable high-precision absolute gravity measurements, crucial for applications in geophysics, navigation, resource exploration, and metrology. Understanding their underlying mechanisms and minimizing measurement noise are essential for enhancing performance. This work investigates the gravity measurement noise in AI-based systems induced by the dead time of the classical accelerometer. Using actual dynamic gravity measurement data, we demonstrate that a dead time of 0.12 s introduces significant gravity measurement noise of 8 mGal. To elucidate the mechanism of this noise, we derive a formula for this noise in frequency domain, identifying high-frequency aliasing as its source. Analysis of the derived expressions indicates that reducing the dead time duration and suppressing the high-frequency noise of the acceleration are effective strategies for mitigating this noise. This work provides significant insights for noise analysis and future scheme design of AI-based dynamic gravimeters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-based Quantum Computation(MBQC) utilize entanglement as resource for performing quantum computation. Generating cluster state using entanglement as resource is a key bottleneck for the adoption of MBQC. To generate cluster state with charge-qubit arrrays, we provide analytical derivations and numerical validations for 4-qubit cluster state. We compare our fidelities under ideal (noise-free) Hamiltonian evolution and due to effect of decoherence. We show incorporating energy relaxation ($T_1$) yields $&gt;$90\% fidelity while pure dephasing $T_2$ show $70\%$ decays at fourth harmonics. We further show under noise $T_2$ decays to 50\% within 15 time units, versus $&gt;$70\% under relaxation time units ($T_1$)--only. This decay quantify degradation effect of $T_2$ on preparing cluster--state preparation is more than $T_1$. We highlight the critical need for targeted error-mitigation strategies in near-term MBQC implementations.</description>
