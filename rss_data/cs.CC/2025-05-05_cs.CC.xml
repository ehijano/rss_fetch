      <title>The tape reconfiguration problem and its consequences for dominating set reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set of vertices $D \subseteq V$ whose closed neighborhood is $V$, i.e., $N[D]=V$. We view a dominating set as a collection of tokens placed on the vertices of $D$. In the token sliding variant of the Dominating Set Reconfiguration problem (TS-DSR), we seek to transform a source dominating set into a target dominating set in $G$ by sliding tokens along edges, and while maintaining a dominating set all along the transformation.
  TS-DSR is known to be PSPACE-complete even restricted to graphs of pathwidth $w$, for some non-explicit constant $w$ and to be XL-complete parameterized by the size $k$ of the solution. The first contribution of this article consists in using a novel approach to provide the first explicit constant for which the TS-DSR problem is PSPACE-complete, a question that was left open in the literature.
  From a parameterized complexity perspective, the token jumping variant of DSR, i.e., where tokens can jump to arbitrary vertices, is known to be FPT when parameterized by the size of the dominating sets on nowhere dense classes of graphs. But, in contrast, no non-trivial result was known about TS-DSR. We prove that DSR is actually much harder in the sliding model since it is XL-complete when restricted to bounded pathwidth graphs and even when parameterized by $k$ plus the feedback vertex set number of the graph. This gives, for the first time, a difference of behavior between the complexity under token sliding and token jumping for some problem on graphs of bounded treewidth. All our results are obtained using a brand new method, based on the hardness of the so-called Tape Reconfiguration problem, a problem we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Parameterised Holant Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of parameterised holant problems p-$\mathrm{Holant}(\mathcal{S})$ for families of signatures $\mathcal{S}$. The parameterised holant framework was introduced by Curticapean in 2015 as a counter-part to the classical theory of holographic reductions and algorithms and it constitutes an extensive family of coloured and weighted counting constraint satisfaction problems on graph-like structures, encoding as special cases various well-studied counting problems in parameterised and fine-grained complexity theory such as counting edge-colourful $k$-matchings, graph-factors, Eulerian orientations or, subgraphs with weighted degree constraints. We establish an exhaustive complexity trichotomy along the set of signatures $\mathcal{S}$: Depending on $\mathcal{S}$, p-$\mathrm{Holant}(\mathcal{S})$ is: (1) solvable in FPT-near-linear time (i.e. $f(k)\cdot \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(|x|)$); (2) solvable in "FPT-matrix-multiplication time" (i.e. $f(k)\cdot {\mathcal{O}}(n^{\omega})$) but not solvable in FPT-near-linear time unless the Triangle Conjecture fails; or (3) #W[1]-complete and no significant improvement over brute force is possible unless ETH fails. This classification reveals a significant and surprising gap in the complexity landscape of parameterised Holants: Not only is every instance either fixed-parameter tractable or #W[1]-complete, but additionally, every FPT instance is solvable in time $f(k)\cdot {\mathcal{O}}(n^{\omega})$.
  We also establish a complete classification for a natural uncoloured version of parameterised holant problem p-$\mathrm{UnColHolant}(\mathcal{S})$, which encodes as special cases the non-coloured analogues of the aforementioned examples. We show that the complexity of p-$\mathrm{UnColHolant}(\mathcal{S})$ is different: Depending on $\mathcal{S}$ all instances are either solvable in FPT-near-linear time, or #W[1]-complete.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Minimum-Envy House Allocation Over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalization of the House Allocation problem. In our problem, agents are represented by vertices of a graph $\GG_{\mathcal{A}} = (\AA, E_\AA)$, and each agent $a \in \AA$ is associated with a set of preferred houses $\PP_a \subseteq \HH$, where $\AA$ is the set of agents and $\HH$ is the set of houses. A house allocation is an injective function $\phi: \AA \rightarrow \HH$, and an agent $a$ envies a neighbour $a' \in N_{\GG_\AA}(a)$ under $\phi$ if $\phi(a) \notin \PP_a$ and $\phi(a') \in \PP_a$. We study two natural objectives: the first problem called \ohaa, aims to compute an allocation that minimizes the number of envious agents; the second problem called \ohaah aims to maximize, among all minimum-envy allocations, the number of agents who are assigned a house they prefer. These two objectives capture complementary notions of fairness and individual satisfaction.
  We design polynomial time algorithms for both problems for the variant when each agent prefers exactly one house. On the other hand, when the list of preferred houses for each agent has size at most $2$ then we show that both problems are \NP-hard even when the agent graph $\GG_\AA$ is a complete bipartite graph. We also show that both problems are \NP-hard even when the number $|\mathcal H|$ of houses is equal to the number $|\mathcal A|$ of agents. This is in contrast to the classical {\sc House Allocation} problem, where the problem is polynomial time solvable when $|\mathcal H| = |\mathcal A|$. The two problems are also \NP-hard when the agent graph has a small vertex cover. On the positive side, we design exact algorithms that exploit certain structural properties of $\GG_{\AA}$ such as sparsity, existence of balanced separators or existence of small-sized vertex covers, and perform better than the naive brute-force algorithm.</description>
