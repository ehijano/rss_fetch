      <title>Entropy measures and their applications: A comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy has emerged as a dynamic, interdisciplinary, and widely accepted quantitative measure of uncertainty across different disciplines. A unified understanding of entropy measures, supported by a detailed review of their theoretical foundations and practical applications, is crucial to advance research across disciplines. This review article provides motivation, fundamental properties, and constraints of various entropy measures. These measures are categorized with time evolution ranging from Shannon entropy generalizations, distribution function theory, fuzzy theory, fractional calculus to graph theory, all explained in a simplified and accessible manner. These entropy measures are selected on the basis of their usability, with descriptions arranged chronologically. We have further discussed the applicability of these measures across different domains, including thermodynamics, communication theory, financial engineering, categorical data, artificial intelligence, signal processing, and chemical and biological systems, highlighting their multifaceted roles. A number of examples are included to demonstrate the prominence of specific measures in terms of their applicability. The article also focuses on entropy-based applications in different disciplines, emphasizing openly accessible resources. Furthermore, this article emphasizes the applicability of various entropy measures in the field of finance. The article may provide a good insight to the researchers and experts working to quantify uncertainties, along with potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate Analysis of the Join-the-Shortest-Queue System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy is among the most widely used routing algorithms for load balancing systems and has been extensively studied. Despite its simplicity and optimality, exact characterization of the system remains challenging. Most prior research has focused on analyzing its performance in steady-state in certain asymptotic regimes such as the heavy-traffic regime. However, the convergence rate to the steady-state in these regimes is often slow, calling into question the reliability of analyses based solely on the steady-state and heavy-traffic approximations. To address this limitation, we provide a finite-time convergence rate analysis of a JSQ system with two symmetric servers. In sharp contrast to the existing literature, we directly study the original system as opposed to an approximate limiting system such as a diffusion approximation. Our results demonstrate that for such a system, the convergence rate to its steady-state, measured in the total variation distance, is $O \left(\frac{1}{(1-\rho)^3} \right)$, where $\rho \in (0,1)$ is the traffic intensity.</description>

      <title>Polluted Modified Bootstrap Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the polluted modified bootstrap percolation model, sites in the square lattice are independently initially occupied with probability $p$ or closed with probability $q$. A site becomes occupied at a subsequent step if it is not closed and has at least one occupied nearest neighbor in each of the two coordinates. We study the final density of occupied sites when $p$ and $q$ are both small. We show that this density approaches $0$ if $q\ge Cp^2/\log p^{-1}$ and $1$ if $q\le p^2/(\log p^{-1})^{1+o(1)}$. Thus we establish a logarithmic correction in the critical scaling, which is known not to be present in the standard model, settling a conjecture of Gravner and McDonald from 1997.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of the viscous scalar conservation laws with a degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the ergodicity in $H^\mathfrak n,\mathfrak n=\lfloor\frac{d}{2}+1\rfloor$ of the viscous scalar conservation laws on torus $\mathbb T^d$ with general polynomial flux and a degenerate noise. The noise could appear in as few as several directions. We introduce a localized framework that restricts attention to trajectories with controlled energy growth, circumventing the limitations of traditional contraction-based approaches. This localized method allows for a demonstration of e-property and consequently proves the uniqueness of invariant measure under a H{\"o}rmander-type condition. Furthermore, we characterize the absolute continuity of the invariant measure's projections onto any finite-dimensional subspaces under requirement on an algebraic nondegenerate condition for the flux.</description>

      <title>On the maximal displacement of critical branching random walk in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the maximal displacement of critical branching random walk in random environment. Let $M_n$ be the maximal displacement of a particle in generation $n$, and $Z_n$ be the total population in generation $n$, $M$ be the rightmost point ever reached by the branching random walk.
  Under some reasonable conditions, we prove a conditional limit theorem,
  \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{L}\left( \dfrac{M_n}{\sqrt{\sigma} n^{\frac{3}{4}}} |Z_n&gt;0\right) \dcon \mathcal{L}\left(A_\Lambda\right),
  \end{equation*}
  where
  random variable $A_\Lambda$ is related to the standard Brownian meander. And there exist some positive constant $C_1$ and $C_2$, such that
  \begin{equation*}
  C_1\leqslant\liminf\limits_{x\rightarrow\infty}x^{\frac{2}{3}}\P(M&gt;x) \leqslant
  \limsup\limits_{x\rightarrow\infty} x^{\frac{2}{3}}\P(M&gt;x) \leqslant C_2.
  \end{equation*}
  Compared with the constant environment case (Lalley and Shao (2015)),
  it revaels that, the conditional limit speed for $M_n$ in random environment (i.e., $n^{\frac{3}{4}}$) is significantly greater than that of constant environment case (i.e., $n^{\frac{1}{2}}$), and so is the tail probability for the $M$ (i.e., $x^{-\frac{2}{3}}$ vs $x^{-2}$).
  Our method is based on the path large deviation for the reduced critical branching random walk in random environment.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian central limit theorem for a stationary time series with infinite varia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a borderline case: the central limit theorem for a strictly stationary time series with infinite variance but a Gaussian limit. In the iid case a well-known sufficient condition for this central limit theorem is regular variation of the marginal distribution with tail index $\alpha=2$. In the dependent case we assume the stronger condition of sequential regular variation of the time series with tail index $\alpha=2$. We assume that a sample of size $n$ from this time series can be split into $k_n$ blocks of size $r_n\to\infty$ such that $r_n/n\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$ and that the block sums are asymptotically independent. Then we apply classical central limit theory for row-wise iid triangular arrays. The necessary and sufficient conditions for such independent block sums will be verified by using large deviation results for the time series. We derive the central limit theorem for $m$-dependent sequences, linear processes, stochastic volatility processes and solutions to affine stochastic recurrence equations whose marginal distributions have infinite variance and are regularly varying with tail index $\alpha=2$.</description>

      <title>A note on the binomial distribution motivated by Chv\'{a}tal's theorem and Tomasewski's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B(n,p)$ denote a binomial random variable with parameters $n$ and $p$. Chv\'{a}tal's theorem says that for any fixed $n\geq 2$, as $m$ ranges over $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, the probability $q_m:=P(B(n,m/n)\leq m)$ is the smallest when $m$ is closest to $2n/3$. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the family of random variables of the form $X=\sum^n_{k=1}a_k\varepsilon_k$, where $n\ge 1$, $a_k, k=1, \dots, n,$ are real numbers with $\sum^n_{k=1} a_k^2=1$, and $\varepsilon_k$, $k=1, 2, \dots$, are independent Rademacher random variables (i.e., $P(\varepsilon_k=1)=P(\varepsilon_k=-1)=1/2$). Tomaszewski's theorem says that $\inf_{X\in \mathcal{R}}P(|X|\leq 1)=1/2$. Motivated by Chv\'{a}tal's Theorem and Tomasewski's Theorem, in this note, we study the minimum value of the probability $f_n(k):=P(|B(n,k/n)-k|\leq \sqrt{{\rm Var} (B(n,k/n))})$ when $k$ ranges over $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$ for any fixed $n\geq 1$, where ${\rm Var} (\cdot)$ denotes the variance, and prove that it is the smallest when $k=1$ and $n-1$.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Self-Exciting Processes with Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the class of multidimensional self-exciting processes with dependencies (MSPD), which is a unifying writing for a large class of processes: counting, loss, intensity, and also shifted processes. The framework takes into account dynamic dependencies between the frequency and the severity components of the risk, and therefore induces theoretical challenges in the computations of risk valuations. We present a general method for calculating different quantities related to these MSPDs, which combines the Poisson imbedding, the pseudo-chaotic expansion and Malliavin calculus. The methodology is illustrated for the computation of explicit general correlation formula.</description>

      <title>A phase transition for the two-dimensional random field Ising/FK-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the total variation (TV) distance between the laws of the 2D Ising/FK-Ising model in a box of side-length $N$ with and without an i.i.d.\ Gaussian external field with variance $\epsilon^2$. Letting the external field strength $\epsilon = \epsilon(N)$ depend on the size of the box, we derive a phase transition for each model depending on the order of $\epsilon(N)$. For the random field Ising model, the critical order for $\epsilon$ is $N^{-1}$. For the random field FK-Ising model, the critical order depends on the temperature regime: for $T&gt;T_c$, $T=T_c$ and $T\in (0, T_c)$ the critical order for $\epsilon$ is, respectively, $N^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, $N^{-\frac{15}{16}}$ and $N^{-1}$. In each case, as $N \to \infty$ the TV distance under consideration converges to $1$ when $\epsilon$ is above the respective critical order and converges to $0$ when below.</description>

      <title>The Paradox of Anti-Inductive Dice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new type of paradoxical behavior in dice, where the sum of independent rolls produces a deceptive sequence of dominance relations. We call these ``anti-inductive dice". Consider a game with two players and two non-identical dice. Each rolls their die $k$ times, adding the results, and the player with the highest sum wins. For each $k$, this induces a dominance relation between dice, with $A[k]\succ B[k]$ if $A$ is more likely than $B$ to win after $k$ rolls, and vice versa. For certain classes of dice, the limiting behavior of these relations is well-established in the literature, but the transient behavior, the subject of this paper, is less well-understood. This transient behavior, even for dice with only 4 faces, contains an immensely rich parameter space with fractal-like behavior.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Limits of Recovering Planted Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary subgraph $H=H_n$ and $p=p_n \in (0,1)$, the planted subgraph model is defined as follows. A statistician observes the union a random copy $H^*$ of $H$, together with random noise in the form of an instance of an Erdos-Renyi graph $G(n,p)$. Their goal is to recover the planted $H^*$ from the observed graph. Our focus in this work is to understand the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) for sufficiently large $n$.
  A recent paper [MNSSZ23] characterizes the graphs for which the limiting MMSE curve undergoes a sharp phase transition from $0$ to $1$ as $p$ increases, a behavior known as the all-or-nothing phenomenon, up to a mild density assumption on $H$. In this paper, we provide a formula for the limiting MMSE curve for any graph $H=H_n$, up to the same mild density assumption. This curve is expressed in terms of a variational formula over pairs of subgraphs of $H$, and is inspired by the celebrated subgraph expectation thresholds from the probabilistic combinatorics literature [KK07]. Furthermore, we give a polynomial-time description of the optimizers of this variational problem. This allows one to efficiently approximately compute the MMSE curve for any dense graph $H$ when $n$ is large enough. The proof relies on a novel graph decomposition of $H$ as well as a new minimax theorem which may be of independent interest.
  Our results generalize to the setting of minimax rates of recovering arbitrary monotone boolean properties planted in random noise, where the statistician observes the union of a planted minimal element $A \subseteq [N]$ of a monotone property and a random $Ber(p)^{\otimes N}$ vector. In this setting, we provide a variational formula inspired by the so-called "fractional" expectation threshold [Tal10], again describing the MMSE curve (in this case up to a multiplicative constant) for large enough $n$.</description>

  parameter $H\in (\frac{1}{4},1)$. In the case $ \frac{1}{4} &lt; H &lt; \frac{1}{2} $, the norm can be either the supremum norm or H\"older norms of order $ \beta $ with $ 0 &lt; \beta &lt; H - \frac{1}{4} $. In the case $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt; 1 $, the norms can be a H\"older norm of order $ \beta$ with $ H - \frac{1}{2} &lt; \beta &lt; H - \frac{1}{4} $. As an example, we compute the Onsager-Machlup functional for the stochastic pendulum equation</description>

      <title>Maximal Entropy Random Walks in Z: Random and non-random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW) is a natural process on a finite graph, introduced a few years ago with motivations from theoretical physics. The construction of this process relies on Perron-Frobenius theory for adjacency matrices.Generalizing to infinite graphs is rather delicate, and in this article, we treat in a fairly exhaustive manner the case of the MERW on Z with loops, for both random and nonrandom loops. Thanks to an explicit combinatorial representation of the corresponding Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors, we are able to precisely determine the asymptotic behavior of these walks. We show, in particular, that essentially all MERWs on Z with loops have positive speed.</description>

      <title>Stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and Sinkhorn semigroups for log-concave models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we obtain several new results and developments in the study of entropic optimal transport problems (a.k.a. Schr\"odinger problems) with general reference distributions and log-concave target marginal measures. Our approach combines transportation cost inequalities
  with the theory of Riccati matrix difference equations arising in filtering and optimal control theory. This methodology is partly based on a novel entropic stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and closed form expressions of a class of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations. In the context of regularized entropic transport these techniques provide new sharp entropic map estimates. When applied to the stability of Sinkhorn semigroups, they also yield
  a series of novel contraction estimates in terms of the fixed point of Riccati equations.
  The strength of our approach is that it is applicable to a large class of models arising in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. We illustrate the impact of our results in the context of regularized entropic transport, proximal samplers and diffusion generative models as well as diffusion flow matching models</description>

      <title>Random Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a random walk on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$ in which new elements are produced by randomly applying the adjoint operators corresponding to two generators. Focusing on the generic case where the generators are selected at random, we analyze both the limiting distribution of the random walk and the speed at which it converges to this distribution. These questions reduce to the study of a random walk on the cyclic group $\mathbf{F}_p^\ast$. We show that, with high probability, the walk exhibits a pre-cutoff phenomenon after roughly $p$ steps. Notably, the limiting distribution need not be uniform; rather, it depends on the prime divisors of $p-1$.</description>

      <title>Notes on Correlation Stress Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note outlines an approach to stress testing of covariance of financial time series, in the context of financial risk management. It discusses how the geodesic distance between covariance matrices implies a notion of plausibility of covariance stress tests. In this approach, correlation stress tests span a submanifold of constant determinant of the Fisher--Rao manifold of covariance matrices. A parsimonious geometrically invariant definition of arbitrarily large correlation stress tests is proposed, and a few examples are discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the de Finetti--Hewitt--Savage theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08754v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sequence of random variables is called \textit{exchangeable} if its joint distribution is invariant under permutations of indices. The original formulation of de Finetti's theorem roughly says that any exchangeable sequence of $\{0,1\}$-valued random variables can be thought of as a mixture of independent and identically distributed sequences. Hewitt and Savage were able to obtain the same conclusion for exchangeable sequences of random variables taking values in more general state spaces under some topological conditions.
  Using tools from nonstandard analysis we prove that an exchangeable sequence of Radon-distributed random variables taking values in any Hausdorff state space must be representable as a mixture of sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables.
  Our presentation of this work follows the style of \textit{lecture notes} intended for broad graduate-level mathematical audiences -- the main body of the manuscript starts with a historically grounded introduction to the problem, foreshadowing our techniques that are developed via a series of appendices. These techniques are used to provide self-contained proofs of our main results in a short section following the introduction.
  We have provided a self-contained philosophically motivated introduction to nonstandard analysis in the first appendix, thus rendering first courses in measure theoretic probability and point-set topology as the only prerequisites for the work. This introduction aims to develop some new ideologies about the subject that might be of interest to mathematicians, philosophers, and mathematics educators alike. One highlight of the rest of the appendices is a new generalization of Prokhorov's theorem in the setting of the space of all probability measures on arbitrary Hausdorff spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the potential theory of Dirichlet forms on the half-space $\mathbb{R}^d_+$ defined by the jump kernel $J(x,y)=|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ and the killing potential $\kappa x_d^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and $\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ can blow up to infinity at the boundary. The jump kernel and the killing potential depend on several parameters. For all admissible values of the parameters involved and all $d \ge 1$, we prove that the boundary Harnack principle holds, and establish sharp two-sided estimates on the Green functions of these processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mean reflected stochastic differential equations driven by G-Brownian motion, where the constraint depends on the expectation of the solution rather than on its paths. Well-posedness is achieved by first investigating the Skorokhod problem with mean reflection under G-expectation. Two approaches to constructing the solution are introduced, both offering insights into desired properties and aiding in the application of the contraction mapping method.</description>

Under our assumptions, we are able to consider the stochastic heat equation up to dimension $3$, the stochastic damped wave equation in dimension $1$ and the stochastic Euler-Bernoulli damped beam equation up to dimension $3$.

      <description>arXiv:2401.06284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove nonasymptotic matrix concentration inequalities for the spectral norm of (sub)gaussian random matrices with centered independent entries that capture fluctuations at the Tracy-Widom scale. This considerably improves previous bounds in this setting due to Bandeira and Van Handel, and establishes the best possible tail behavior for random matrices with an arbitrary variance pattern. These bounds arise from an extremum problem for nonhomogeneous random matrices: among all variance patterns with a given sparsity parameter, the moments of the random matrix are maximized by block-diagonal matrices with i.i.d. entries in each block. As part of the proof, we obtain sharp bounds on large moments of Gaussian Wishart matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $U,H$ be two separable Hilbert spaces and $T&gt;0$. We consider an SDE which evolves in the Hilbert space $H$ of the form \begin{align} dX(t)=AX(t)dt+\widetilde{\mathscr L}B(X(t))dt+GdW(t), \quad t\in[0,T], \quad X(0)=x \in H, \end{align} where $A:D(A)\subseteq H\to H$ is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $(e^{tA})_{t\geq0}$, $W=(W(t))_{t\geq0}$ is a $U$-cylindrical Wiener process defined on a normal filtered probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t\in [0,T]},\mathbb{P})$, $B:H\to H$ is a bounded and $\theta$-H\"older continuous function, for some suitable $\theta\in(0,1)$, and $\widetilde{\mathscr L}:H\to H$ and $G:U\to H$ are linear bounded operators. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on the coefficients, the weak mild solution to the equation depends on the initial datum in a Lipschitz way. This implies that pathwise uniqueness holds true. Here, the presence of the operator $\Lambda$ plays a crucial role. In particular the conditions assumed on the coefficients cover the stochastic damped wave equation in dimension $1$ and the stochastic damped Euler--Bernoulli Beam equation upto dimension $3$ even in the hyperbolic case.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a non-Markovian rumor model in the complete graph on $n$ vertices inspired by Daley and Kendall's ideas (1964). For this model, we prove a functional law of large numbers (FLLN) and a functional central limit theorem (FCLT). We apply these results to a non-Markovian version of the model introduced by Lebensztayn, Machado and Rodr\'{i}guez (2011).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the fluctuation moments $\alpha_{m_1,\dots,m_r}$ of a Complex Wigner Matrix $X_N$ given by the limit $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}N^{r-2}k_r(Tr(X_N^{m_1}),\dots,Tr(X_N^{m_r}))$. We prove the limit exists and characterize the leading order via planar graphs that result to be trees. We prove these graphs can be counted by the set of non-crossing partitioned permutations which permit us to express the moments $\alpha_{m_1,\dots,m_r}$ in terms of simpler quantities $\kappa_{m_1,\dots,m_r}$ known as the higher order cumulants. As for lower order dimensions ($r \leq 3$) we observe that while the moments have a more elaborated expression the cumulants are simpler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper of Tsai shows how the first few moments of a stochastic flow in the space of measures can completely determine its law. Here we give another proof of this result for the particular case of the one-dimensional multiplicative stochastic heat equation (mSHE), and then we investigate two corollaries. The first one recovers a recent result of Hairer on a ``variance blowup" problem related to the KPZ equation , albeit in a much weaker topology. The second one recovers a KPZ scaling limit result related to random walks in random environments, but in a weaker topology. In these two problems, we furthermore explain why it is hard to directly use the martingale characterization of the mSHE, the chaos expansion, or other known methods. Using the moment-based approach avoids technicalities, leading to a short proof.</description>

      <title>On intermediate levels of nested occupancy scheme in random environment generated by stick-breaking: the case of heavy tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a nested balls-in-boxes scheme in a random environment. The boxes follow a nested hierarchy, with infinitely many boxes in each level, and the hitting probabilities of boxes are random and obtained by iterated fragmentation of a unit mass. The hitting probabilities of the first-level boxes are given by a stick-breaking model $P_k = W_1 W_2\cdot \ldots\cdot W_{k-1}(1- W_k)$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$, where $W_1$, $W_2,\ldots$ are independent copies of a random variable $W$ taking values in $(0,1)$. The infinite balls-in-boxes scheme in the first level is known as a Bernoulli sieve. We assume that the mean of $|\log W|$ is infinite and the distribution tail of $|\log W|$ is regularly varying at $\infty$. Denote by $K_n(j)$ the number of occupied boxes in the $j$th level provided that there are $n$ balls and call the level $j$ intermediate, if $j = j_n \to \infty$ and $j_n = o((\log n)^a)$ as $n \to \infty$ for appropriate $a&gt;0$. We prove that, for some intermediate levels $j$, finite-dimensional distributions of the process $(K_n(\lfloor j_n u\rfloor))_{u&gt;0}$, properly normalized, converge weakly as $n\to\infty$ to those of a pathwise Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, with the integrand being an exponential function and the integrator being an inverse stable subordinator. The present paper continues the line of investigation initiated in the articles Buraczewski, Dovgay and Iksanov (2020) and Iksanov, Marynych and Samoilenko (2022) in which the random variable $|\log W|$ has a finite second moment, and Iksanov, Marynych and Rashytov (2022) in which $|\log W|$ has a finite mean and an infinite second moment.</description>

      <title>A new bound in Majority Dynamics on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of majority dynamics on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi $G(n,p)$ random graphs. In this process, each vertex of a graph is assigned one of two initial states. Subsequently, on every day, each vertex simultaneously updates its state to the most common state in its neighbourhood.
  If the difference in the numbers of vertices in each state on day $0$ is larger than $ \max \left\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}} \exp\left[A\sqrt{\log \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)}\right] , Bp^{-3/2} n^{-1/2} \right\}$ for constants $A$ and $B$, we demonstrate that the state with the initial majority wins with overwhelmingly high probability. This extends work by Linh Tran and Van Vu (2023), who previously considered this phenomenon.
  We also study majority dynamics with a random initial assignment of vertex states. When each vertex is assigned to a state with equal probability, we show that unanimity occurs with high probability for every $p \geq \lambda n^{-2/3}$, for some constant $\lambda$. This improves work by Fountoulakis, Kang and Makai (2020).
  Furthermore, we also consider a random initial assignment of vertex states where a vertex is slightly more likely to be in the first state than the second state. Previous work by Zehmakan (2018) and Tran and Vu (2023) provided conditions on how big this bias needs to be for the first colour to achieve unanimity with high probability. We strengthen these results by providing a weaker sufficient condition.</description>

      <title>Uniformly consistent proportion estimation for composite hypotheses via integral equations: "the case of Gamma random variables"</title>

      <description>arXiv:1906.10246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider estimating the proportion of random variables for two types of composite null hypotheses: (i) the means of the random variables belonging to a non-empty, bounded interval; (ii) the means of the random variables belonging to an unbounded interval that is not the whole real line. For each type of composite null hypotheses, uniformly consistent estimators of the proportion of false null hypotheses are constructed for random variables whose distributions are members of the Gamma family. Further, uniformly consistent estimators of certain functions of a bounded null on the means are provided for the random variables mentioned earlier. These functions are continuous and of bounded variation. The estimators are constructed via solutions to Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral equations and harmonic analysis, do not rely on a concept of p-value, and have various applications.ce via mixture models, and may be used to estimate the sparsity level in high-dimensional Gaussian linear models.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of general semilinear PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11579v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neufeld and Wu (arXiv:2310.12545) developed a multilevel Picard (MLP) algorithm which can approximately solve general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities, allowing also for coefficient functions of the corresponding PDE to be non-constant. By introducing a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula and identifying the first and second component of the unique fixed-point of the SFPE with the unique viscosity solution of the PDE and its gradient, they proved convergence of their algorithm. However, it remained an open question whether the proposed MLP schema in arXiv:2310.12545 does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we prove that the MLP algorithm in arXiv:2310.12545 indeed can overcome the curse of dimensionality, i.e. that its computational complexity only grows polynomially in the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the accuracy $\varepsilon$, under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear part of the corresponding PDE.</description>

      <title>Approximation of plurisubharmonic functions by logarithms of Gaussian analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11833v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Given a continuous plurisubharmonic function $u$ on $\Omega$, we construct a sequence of Gaussian analytic functions $f_n$ on $\Omega$ associated with $u$ such that $\frac{1}{n}\log|f_n|$ converges to $u$ in $L^1_{loc}(\Omega)$ almost surely, as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Gaussian analytic function $f_n$ is defined through its covariance, or equivalently, via its reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which corresponds to the weighted Bergman space with weight $e^{-2nu}$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. As a consequence, we show the normalized zeros of $f_n$ converge to $dd^c u$ in the sense of currents.</description>

      <title>Frogs, hats and common subsequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Write $W^{(n)}$ to mean the $n$-letter word obtained by repeating a fixed word $W$ and let $R_n$ denote a uniformly random $n$-letter word sampled from the same alphabet as $W$. We are interested in the average length of the longest common subsequence between $W^{(n)}$ and $R_n$, which is known to be $\gamma(W)\cdot n+o(n)$ for some constant $\gamma(W)$. Bukh and Cox recently developed an interacting particle system, dubbed the frog dynamics, which can be used to compute the constant $\gamma(W)$ for any fixed word $W$. They successfully analyzed the simplest case of the frog dynamics to find an explicit formula for the constants $\gamma(12\cdots k)$. We continue this study by using the frog dynamics to find an explicit formula for the constants $\gamma(12\cdots kk\cdots 21)$. The frog dynamics in this case is a variation of the PushTASEP on the ring where some clocks are identical. Interestingly, exclusion processes with correlated clocks of this type appear to have not been analyzed before. Our analysis leads to a seemingly new combinatorial object which could be of independent interest: frogs with hats!</description>

      <title>Computation of Robust Option Prices via Structured Multi-Marginal Martingale Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient computational framework for solving a class of multi-marginal martingale optimal transport problems, which includes many robust pricing problems of large financial interest. Such problems are typically computationally challenging due to the martingale constraint, however, by extending the state space we can identify them with problems that exhibit a certain sequential martingale structure. Our method exploits such structures in combination with entropic regularisation, enabling fast computation of optimal solutions and allowing us to solve problems with a large number of marginals. We demonstrate the method by using it for computing robust price bounds for different options, such as lookback options and Asian options.</description>

      <title>Solution space characterisation of perturbed linear discrete and continuous stochastic Volterra convolution equations: the $\ell^p$ and $L^p$ cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we are concerned with characterising when solutions of perturbed linear stochastic Volterra summation equations are $p$-summable along with when their continuous time counterparts, perturbed linear stochastic Volterra integrodifferential equations are $p$-integrable. In the discrete case we find it necessary and sufficient that perturbing functions are $p$-summable in order to ensure paths of the discrete equation are $p$-summable almost surely, while in the continuous case it transpires one can have almost surely $p$-integrable sample paths even with non-integrable perturbation functions. For the continuous equation the main converse is clinched by considering an appropriate discretisation and applying results from the discrete case. We also conduct a thorough study of the asymptotic behaviour of the trajectories of solutions to the continuous equation in the regime of $p$-integrable paths and provide a characterisation of asymptotic convergence to zero in the case of diagonal noise. Additionally we highlight how all proof methods can be applied to obtain even stronger results for stochastic functional differential equations.</description>

      <title>2DSig-Detect: a semi-supervised framework for anomaly detection on image data using 2D-signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning technologies raises questions about the security of machine learning models, with respect to both training-time (poisoning) and test-time (evasion, impersonation, and inversion) attacks. Models performing image-related tasks, e.g. detection, and classification, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can degrade their performance and produce undesirable outcomes. This paper introduces a novel technique for anomaly detection in images called 2DSig-Detect, which uses a 2D-signature-embedded semi-supervised framework rooted in rough path theory. We demonstrate our method in adversarial settings for training-time and test-time attacks, and benchmark our framework against other state of the art methods. Using 2DSig-Detect for anomaly detection, we show both superior performance and a reduction in the computation time to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations in images.</description>

      <title>A Class of Degenerate Mean Field Games, Associated FBSDEs and Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of degenerate mean field games (MFGs) with state-distribution dependent and unbounded functional diffusion coefficients. With a probabilistic method, we study the well-posedness of the forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) associated with the MFG and arising from the maximum principle, and estimate the corresponding Jacobian and Hessian flows. We further establish the classical regularity of the value functional $V$; in particular, we show that when the cost function is $C^3$ in the spatial and control variables and $C^2$ in the distribution argument, then the value functional is $C^1$ in time and $C^2$ in the spatial and distribution variables. As a consequence, the value functional $V$ is the unique classical solution of the degenerate MFG master equation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic non-linear shrinkage and eigenvector overlap for weighted sample covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute asymptotic non-linear shrinkage formulas for covariance and precision matrix estimators for weighted sample covariances, and the joint sample-population eigenvector overlap distribution, in the spirit of Ledoit and P\'ech\'e. We detail explicitly the formulas for exponentially-weighted sample covariances. We propose an algorithm to numerically compute those formulas. Experimentally, we show the performance of the asymptotic non-linear shrinkage estimators. Finally, we test the robustness of the theory to a heavy-tailed distributions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Decision Focused Learning under Imprecise Uncertainty--Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision Focused Learning has emerged as a critical paradigm for integrating machine learning with downstream optimisation. Despite its promise, existing methodologies predominantly rely on probabilistic models and focus narrowly on task objectives, overlooking the nuanced challenges posed by epistemic uncertainty, non-probabilistic modelling approaches, and the integration of uncertainty into optimisation constraints. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing innovative frameworks: (i) a non-probabilistic lens for epistemic uncertainty representation, leveraging intervals (the least informative uncertainty model), Contamination (hybrid model), and probability boxes (the most informative uncertainty model); (ii) methodologies to incorporate uncertainty into constraints, expanding Decision-Focused Learning's utility in constrained environments; (iii) the adoption of Imprecise Decision Theory for ambiguity-rich decision-making contexts; and (iv) strategies for addressing sparse data challenges. Empirical evaluations on benchmark optimisation problems demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches in improving decision quality and robustness and dealing with said gaps.</description>

      <title>Langevin Monte-Carlo Provably Learns Depth Two Neural Nets at Any Size and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that under Total Variation distance and q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result combines several recent observations, like our previous papers showing that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</description>
