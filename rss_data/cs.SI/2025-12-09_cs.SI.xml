      <title>Rabble-Rousers in the New King's Court: Algorithmic Effects on Account Visibility in Pre-X Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic effects on social media platforms have come under recent scrutiny, with several works reporting that right-leaning accounts tend to receive more exposure. In this paper, we expand upon this body of work using data collected from user feeds after Twitter's change of ownership but before its re-branding to X. We replicate findings from prior work regarding the increased exposure of right-leaning accounts to wider audiences in algorithmically curated compared to reverse-chronological feeds, and, crucially, we further unpack this effect to understand what correlated (and did not correlate) with these differences. Our results reveal that right-leaning accounts benefited not necessarily due to their political affiliation, but possibly because they behaved in ways associated with algorithmic rewards; namely, posting more agitating content and receiving attention from the platform's owner, Elon Musk, who was the most central network account. We also demonstrate that legacy-verified accounts, like businesses and government officials, received less exposure in the algorithmic feed compared to non-verified or Twitter Blue-verified accounts. We discuss implications of these findings for the intersection between behavioral incentives for algorithmic reach and online trust and safety.</description>

      <title>The relationship between offline partisan geographical segregation and online partisan segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media is often blamed for the creation of echo chambers. However, these claims fail to consider the prevalence of offline echo chambers resulting from high levels of partisan segregation in the United States. Our article empirically assesses these online versus offline dynamics by linking a novel dataset of voters' offline partisan segregation extracted from publicly available voter files for 180 million US voters with their online network segregation on Twitter. We investigate offline and online partisan segregation using measures of geographical and network isolation of every matched voter-twitter user to their co-partisans online and offline. Our results show that while social media users tend to form politically homogeneous online networks, these levels of partisan sorting are significantly lower than those found in offline settings. Notably, Democrats are more isolated than Republicans in both settings, and only older Republicans exhibit higher online than offline segregation. Our results contribute to the emerging literature on political communication and the homophily of online networks, providing novel evidence on partisan sorting both online and offline.</description>

      <title>DDFI: Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation via Two-step Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incomplete node features are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, e.g., the attributes of web users may be partly private, which causes the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decline significantly. Feature propagation (FP) is a well-known method that performs well for imputation of missing node features on graphs, but it still has the following three issues: 1) it struggles with graphs that are not fully connected, 2) imputed features face the over-smoothing problem, and 3) FP is tailored for transductive tasks, overlooking the feature distribution shift in inductive tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce DDFI, a Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation method that combines feature propagation with a graph-based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) in a nontrivial manner. It first designs a simple yet effective algorithm, namely Co-Label Linking (CLL), that randomly connects nodes in the training set with the same label to enhance the performance on graphs with numerous connected components. Then we develop a novel two-step representation generation process at the inference stage. Specifically, instead of directly using FP-imputed features as input during inference, DDFI further reconstructs the features through the whole MAE to reduce feature distribution shift in the inductive tasks and enhance the diversity of node features. Meanwhile, since existing feature imputation methods for graphs only evaluate by simulating the missing scenes with manually masking the features, we collect a new dataset called Sailing from the records of voyages that contains naturally missing features to help better evaluate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets and Sailing show that DDFI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both transductive and inductive settings.</description>

      <title>Code vs. Context: STEM Students' Resistance to Non-STEM Coursework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many STEM programs now require students to take non-technical courses to develop the soft skills necessary for professional practice, yet engineering students frequently resist this requirement. While prior research often attributes this resistance to heavy workloads, little is known about its cognitive and identity-related mechanisms. This study fills this knowledge gap by examining the effects of Cognitive Switching Costs, Work Overload, and Role Ambiguity on students' Affective Resistance to non-STEM coursework, as well as the subsequent impact on their Willingness to Engage and Long-Term Adoption of skills. We collected survey data from 212 undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering students and tested directional relationships using sequential OLS regression. Role Ambiguity emerged as the strongest predictor of Affective Resistance (beta of 0.47, p less than 0.001), exceeding the effects of Work Overload (beta of 0.20, p equals 0.007) and Cognitive Switching Cost (beta of 0.14, p equals 0.038). In turn, Affective Resistance significantly reduced Willingness to Engage (beta of -0.25, p less than 0.001), while Willingness to Engage served as a strong predictor of Long-Term Adoption (beta of 0.55, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that student resistance is driven primarily by the incongruence between non-technical content and students' emergent professional identities, rather than by cognitive effort or workload alone. To improve outcomes, curricula should focus on reducing role ambiguity by placing humanities and social science material in clear engineering contexts.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Large-Scale Adversarial Activities Through Large-Scale Honey-Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing sophistication of cyber threats demands novel approaches to characterize adversarial strategies, particularly those targeting critical infrastructure and IoT ecosystems. This paper presents a longitudinal analysis of attacker behavior using HoneyTrap, an adaptive honeypot framework deployed across geographically distributed nodes to emulate vulnerable services and safely capture malicious traffic. Over a 24 day observation window, more than 60.3 million events were collected. To enable scalable analytics, raw JSON logs were transformed into Apache Parquet, achieving 5.8 - 9.3x compression and 7.2x faster queries, while ASN enrichment and salted SHA-256 pseudonymization added network intelligence and privacy preservation.
  Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) The majority of traffic targeted HTTP and HTTPS services (ports 80 and 443), with more than 8 million connection attempts and daily peaks exceeding 1.7 million events. (2) SSH (port 22) was frequently subject to brute-force attacks, with over 4.6 million attempts. (3) Less common services like Minecraft (25565) and SMB (445) were also targeted, with Minecraft receiving about 118,000 daily attempts that often coincided with spikes on other ports.</description>

      <title>MASim: Multilingual Agent-Based Simulation for Social Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent role-playing has recently shown promise for studying social behavior with language agents, but existing simulations are mostly monolingual and fail to model cross-lingual interaction, an essential property of real societies. We introduce MASim, the first multilingual agent-based simulation framework that supports multi-turn interaction among generative agents with diverse sociolinguistic profiles. MASim offers two key analyses: (i) global public opinion modeling, by simulating how attitudes toward open-domain hypotheses evolve across languages and cultures, and (ii) media influence and information diffusion, via autonomous news agents that dynamically generate content and shape user behavior. To instantiate simulations, we construct the MAPS benchmark, which combines survey questions and demographic personas drawn from global population distributions. Experiments on calibration, sensitivity, consistency, and cultural case studies show that MASim reproduces sociocultural phenomena and highlights the importance of multilingual simulation for scalable, controlled computational social science.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Bias in Graph Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for cognitive tasks, emulating brain-like computation with high-dimensional vectors known as hypervectors. While HDC offers robustness and efficiency on graph-structured data, its fairness implications remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study fairness in graph HDC, where biases in data representation and decision rules can lead to unequal treatment of different groups. We show how hypervector encoding and similarity-based classification can propagate or even amplify such biases, and we propose a fairness-aware training framework, FairGHDC, to mitigate them. FairGHDC introduces a bias correction term, derived from a gap-based demographic-parity regularizer, and converts it into a scalar fairness factor that scales the update of the class hypervector for the ground-truth label. This enables debiasing directly in the hypervector space without modifying the graph encoder or requiring backpropagation. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairGHDC substantially reduces demographic-parity and equal-opportunity gaps while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard GNNs and fairness-aware GNNs. At the same time, FairGHDC preserves the computational advantages of HDC, achieving up to about one order of magnitude ($\approx 10\times$) speedup in training time on GPU compared to GNN and fairness-aware GNN baselines.</description>

      <title>When Large Language Models Do Not Work: Online Incivility Prediction through Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online incivility has emerged as a widespread and persistent problem in digital communities, imposing substantial social and psychological burdens on users. Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>ComGPT: Detecting Local Community Structure with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, have demonstrated the ability to understand graph structures and have achieved excellent performance in various graph reasoning tasks, such as node classification. Despite their strong abilities in graph reasoning tasks, they lack specific domain knowledge and have a weaker understanding of community-related graph information, which hinders their capabilities in the community detection task. Moreover, local community detection algorithms based on seed expansion, referred to as seed expansion algorithms, often face several shortcomings, including the seed-dependent problem, community diffusion, and free rider effect. To use LLMs to overcome the above shortcomings, we explore a GPT-guided seed expansion algorithm named ComGPT. ComGPT iteratively selects potential nodes by local modularity from the detected community's neighbors, and subsequently employs LLMs to choose the node from these selected potential nodes to join the detected community. To improve LLMs' understanding of community-related graph information, we propose ComIncident, a graph encoding method that incorporates community knowledge and is designed for the community detection task. Additionally, we design the Node Selection Guide (NSG) prompt to enhance LLMs' understanding of community characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that ComGPT outperforms the baselines, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the ComIncident and the NSG prompt.</description>

      <title>Can GNNs Learn Link Heuristics? A Concise Review and Evaluation of Link Prediction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning various forms of information for link prediction, alongside a brief review of existing link prediction methods. Our analysis reveals that GNNs cannot effectively learn structural information related to the number of common neighbors between two nodes, primarily due to the nature of set-based pooling of the neighborhood aggregation scheme. Also, our extensive experiments indicate that trainable node embeddings can improve the performance of GNN-based link prediction models. Importantly, we observe that the denser the graph, the greater such the improvement. We attribute this to the characteristics of node embeddings, where the link state of each link sample could be encoded into the embeddings of nodes that are involved in the neighborhood aggregation of the two nodes in that link sample. In denser graphs, every node could have more opportunities to attend the neighborhood aggregation of other nodes and encode states of more link samples to its embedding, thus learning better node embeddings for link prediction. Lastly, we demonstrate that the insights gained from our research carry important implications in identifying the limitations of existing link prediction methods, which could guide the future development of more robust algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scalable Approximate Biclique Counting over Large Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet, it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts. Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up to 50$\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting.</description>

      <title>Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests imagination serves a broader function: accessing internal world models (IWMs). Here, we employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) through imagination vividness ratings. Using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2) and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSIQ), we construct imagination networks from three human populations (Florida, Poland, London; N=2,743) and six LLM variants in two conversation conditions. Human imagination networks demonstrate robust correlations across centrality measures (expected influence, strength, closeness) and consistent clustering patterns, indicating shared structural organization of IWMs across populations. In contrast, LLM-derived networks show minimal clustering and weak centrality correlations, even when manipulating conversational memory. These systematic differences persist across environmental scenes (VVIQ-2) and sensory modalities (PSIQ), revealing fundamental disparities between human and artificial world models. Our network-based approach provides a quantitative framework for comparing internally-generated representations across cognitive agents, with implications for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>The Neuroticism Paradox: How Emotional Instability Fuels Collective Feelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective emotions shape organizations, communities, and societies, yet the traits that determine who drives them remain unknown. Conventional wisdom holds that stable, extraverted individuals act as emotional leaders, calming and coordinating the feelings of others. Here we challenge this view by analyzing a 30.5-month longitudinal dataset of daily emotions from 38 co-located professionals (733,534 records). Using Granger-causality network reconstruction, we find that emotionally unstable individuals -- those high in neuroticism (r = 0.478, p = 0.002) and low in conscientiousness (r = -0.512, p = 0.001) -- are the true "emotional super-spreaders," while extraversion shows no effect (r = 0.238, p = 0.150). This "Neuroticism Paradox" reveals that emotional volatility, not stability, drives contagion. Emotions propagate with a reproduction rate (R_0 = 15.58) comparable to measles, yet the system avoids collapse through high clustering (C = 0.705) that creates "emotional quarantine zones." Emotional variance increased 22.9% over time, contradicting homeostasis theories and revealing entropy-driven dynamics. We propose an Affective Epidemiology framework showing that collective emotions are governed by network position and volatility rather than personality stability -- transforming how we understand emotional leadership in human systems.</description>
