      <title>Weighted Gelfand pairs, weighted spherical Fourier transform and multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kind of generalized Gelfand pair is introduced via a Banach algebra consisting of bi-invariant functions in a weighted Lebesgue space. The related spherical functions and the Fourier transformation are constructed. The multipliers of the underlying algebra are characterized by this Fourier transformation.</description>

      <title>The fundamental functions of the canonical basis of Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a frequency $\lambda=(\lambda_n)$, we consider the Hardy spaces $ \mathcal{H}_p^\lambda$ of $\lambda$-Dirichlet series $ D = \sum_n a_n e^{-\lambda_n s}$ and study the asymptotic behavior of the upper and lower democracy functions of its canonical basis $\mathcal B=\{e^{-\lambda_ns}\}$. For the ordinary case, $\mathcal B=\{n^{-s}\}$, we give the correct asymptotic behavior of all such functions, while in the general case we give sharp lower and upper bounds for all possible behaviors. Moreover, for $p&gt;2$ we present examples showing that any intermediate behavior (between the extreme bounds) can occur. We also study how different properties of the frequency $\lambda$ lead to particular behaviors of the corresponding fundamental functions. Finally, we apply our results to analyze greedy-type properties of $\mathcal B=\{e^{-\lambda_ns}\}$ for some particular $\lambda$'s.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Operators on Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recurrence for dynamical systems has been studied since the end of the nineteenth century, the study of recurrence for linear operators started with papers by Costakis, Manoussos and Parissis in 2012 and 2014. We explore recurrence in Banach algebras, in the space of continuous linear operators on $\omega=\mathbb{C}^{\mathbb{N}},$ and for composition operators whose symbols are linear fractional transformations, acting on weighted Dirichlet spaces. In particular, we show that composition operators with a parabolic non automorphism symbol are never recurrent. Our results relate to work by Gallardo-Guti\'errez and Montes-Rodr\'iguez in their 2004 AMS Memoir in which they show, among other things, that composition operators induced by parabolic non automorphisms are never hypercyclic in weighted Dirichlet spaces. Our work also relates to a more recent paper by Karim, Benchiheb, and Amouch.</description>

      <title>Lattice Lipschitz superposition operators on Banach function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse and characterise the notion of lattice Lipschitz operator (a class of superposition operators, diagonal Lipschitz maps) when defined between Banach function spaces. After showing some general results, we restrict our attention to the case of those Lipschitz operators which are representable by pointwise composition with a strongly measurable function. Mimicking the classical definition and characterizations of (linear) multiplication operators between Banach function spaces, we show that under certain conditions the requirement for a diagonal Lipschitz operator to be well-defined between two such spaces $X(\mu)$ and $Y(\mu)$ is that it can be represented by a strongly measurable function which belongs to the Bochner space $\mathcal M(X,Y) \big(\mu, Lip_0(\mathbb R) \big). $ Here, $\mathcal M(X,Y) $ is the space of multiplication operators between $X(\mu)$ and $Y(\mu),$ and $Lip_0(\mathbb R)$ is the space of real-valued Lipschitz maps with real variable that are equal to $0$ in $0. $ This opens the door to a better understanding of these maps, as well as finding the relation of these operators to some normed tensor products and other classes of maps.</description>

      <title>On the weak$^*$ separability of the space of Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture that whenever $M$ is a metric space of density at most continuum, then the space of Lipschitz functions is $w^*$-separable. We prove the conjecture for several classes of metric spaces including all the Banach spaces with a projectional skeleton, Banach spaces with a $w^*$-separable dual unit ball and locally separable complete metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Regular one-parameter groups, reflection positivity and their application to Hankel operators and standard subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard subspaces are a well studied object in algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT). Given a standard subspace ${\tt V}$ of a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, one is interested in unitary one-parameter groups on $\mathcal{H}$ with $U_t {\tt V} \subseteq {\tt V}$ for every $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$. If $({\tt V},U)$ is a non-degenerate standard pair on $\mathcal{H}$, i.e. the self-adjoint infinitesimal generator of $U$ is a positive operator with trivial kernel, two classical results are given by Borchers' Theorem, relating non-degenerate standard pairs to positive energy representations of the affine group $\mathrm{Aff}(\mathbb{R})$ and the Longo--Witten Theorem, stating the the semigroup of unitary endomorphisms of ${\tt V}$ can be identified with the semigroup of symmetric operator-valued inner functions on the upper half plane.
  In this thesis we prove results similar to the theorems of Borchers and of Longo--Witten for a more general framework of unitary one-parameter groups without the assumption that their infinitesimal generator is positive. We replace this assumption by the weaker assumption that the triple $(\mathcal{H},{\tt V},U)$ is a so called real regular one-parameter group.</description>

      <title>On predicting for non-vanishing continuous time signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05566v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes frequency predictability criteria and presents predictors for two-sided non-vanishing bounded continuous time signals, i.e., for signals from $L_{\infty}(\R)$ that do not necessarily vanish at $\pm\infty$. The notions of transfer functions, the spectrum gaps, bandlimitness, and high-pass filters are introduced for these signals. This allowed to obtain some frequency criteria for predictability and predictors for signals with spectrum degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Linear Deformations of Heisenberg Modules and Gabor Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heisenberg modules over noncommutative tori may also be viewed as Gabor frames. Building on this fact, we relate to deformations of noncommutative tori a bundle of Banach spaces induced by Heisenberg modules. The construction of this bundle of Banach spaces rests on deformation results of Gabor frames with windows in Feichtinger's algebra due to Feichtinger and Kaiblinger. We extend some of these results to Heisenberg modules, e.g. we establish an analog of the results by Feichtinger-Kaiblinger and a Balian-Low theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Bobkov and Chistyakov's (2015) upper bounds on concentration functions of sums of independent random variables to a multivariate entropic setting. The approach is based on pointwise estimates on densities of sums of independent random vectors uniform on centred Euclidean balls. In this vein, we also obtain sharp bounds on volumes of noncentral sections of isotropic convex bodies.</description>

      <title>AI without networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.03354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands on two legs: large training data corpora and many-parameter artificial neural networks (ANNs). The data corpora are needed to represent the complexity and heterogeneity of the world. The role of the networks is less transparent due to the obscure dependence of the network parameters and outputs on the training data and inputs. This raises problems, ranging from technical-scientific to legal-ethical. We hypothesize that a transparent approach to machine learning is possible without using networks at all. By generalizing a parameter-free, statistically consistent data interpolation method, which we analyze theoretically in detail, we develop a network-free framework for AI incorporating generative modeling. We demonstrate this framework with examples from three different disciplines - ethology, control theory, and mathematics. Our generative Hilbert framework applied to the trajectories of small groups of swimming fish outperformed state-of-the-art traditional mathematical behavioral models and current ANN-based models. We demonstrate pure data interpolation based control by stabilizing an inverted pendulum and a driven logistic map around unstable fixed points. Finally, we present a mathematical application by predicting zeros of the Riemann Zeta function, achieving comparable performance as a transformer network. We do not suggest that the proposed framework will always outperform networks as over-parameterized networks can interpolate. However, our framework is theoretically sound, transparent, deterministic, and parameter free: remarkably, it does not require any compute-expensive training, does not involve optimization, has no model selection, and is easily reproduced and ported. We also propose an easily computed method of credit assignment based on this framework, to help address ethical-legal challenges raised by generative AI.</description>

      <title>Linearized optimal transport on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport is a geometrically intuitive, robust and flexible metric for sample comparison in data analysis and machine learning. Its formal Riemannian structure allows for a local linearization via a tangent space approximation. This in turn leads to a reduction of computational complexity and simplifies combination with other methods that require a linear structure. Recently this approach has been extended to the unbalanced Hellinger--Kantorovich (HK) distance. In this article we further extend the framework in various ways, including measures on manifolds, the spherical HK distance, a study of the consistency of discretization via the barycentric projection, and the continuity properties of the logarithmic map for the HK distance.</description>
