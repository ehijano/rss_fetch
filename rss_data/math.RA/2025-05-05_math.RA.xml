      <title>The algebraic and geometric classification of right alternative and semi-alternative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic and geometric classifications of complex $3$-dimensional right alternative and semi-alternative algebras are given. As corollaries, we have the algebraic and geometric classification of complex $3$-dimensional $\mathfrak{perm}$, binary $\mathfrak{perm}$, associative, $(-1,1)$-, binary $(-1,1)$-, and assosymmetric algebras. In particular, we proved that the first example of non-associative right alternative algebras appears in dimension $3;$ the first example of non-associative assosymmetric algebras appears in dimension $3;$ the first example of non-assosymmetric semi-alternative algebras appears in dimension $4;$ the first example of binary $(-1,1)$-algebras, which is non-$(-1,1)$-, appears in dimension $4;$ the first example of right alternative algebras, which is not binary $(-1,1)$-, appears in dimension $4;$ the first example of binary $\mathfrak{perm}$ non-$\mathfrak{perm}$ algebras appears in dimension $4.$ As a byproduct, we give a more easy answer to problem 2.109 from the Dniester Notebook, previously resolved by Shestakov and Arenas.</description>

      <title>Non-commuting graphs of projective spaces over central quotients of Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra with the center $Z(L)$. In this paper, we define a non-commuting graph associated with $L$ as the graph whose vertex set is the projective space of the quotient algebra $L/Z(L)$, and two vertices $span \{ x + Z(L) \}$ and $span \{ y + Z(L) \}$ are adjacent if $x$ and $y$ do not commute under the Lie bracket of $L$. We present several theoretical properties of this graph. For certain classes of Lie algebras, we show that if the non-commuting graphs from two Lie algebras are isomorphic, then these Lie algebras themselves must be isomorphic. Furthermore, we discuss a relation between graph isomorphisms between non-commuting graphs of Lie algebras over finite fields and the size of the algebras.</description>

      <title>Bracket ideals and Hilbert polynomial of filiform Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complex finite-dimensional filiform Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, we first study the bifiltration given by the bracket ideals $[C^k\mathfrak g,C^\ell\mathfrak g]$ and then the behavior of its associated bivariate Hilbert polynomial. This behavior depends in particular on two numerical invariants that measure, on one hand, certain properties of the centralizers in $\mathfrak g$ of the ideals in the lower central sequence and, on the other hand, the dimension of the largest abelian ideal that appears in the lower central series. We give examples proving that the Hilbert polynomial can distinguish isomorphism classes of filiform Lie algebras that cannot be distinguished by the two aforementioned invariants.</description>

      <title>Effective computation of centralizers of ODOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to computing the centralizer $Z (L)$ of an ordinary differential operator (ODO) in the ring of differential operators. Non-trivial centralizers are known to be coordinate rings of spectral curves and contain the ring of polynomials $C [L]$, with coefficients in the field of constants $C$ of $L$.
  We give an algorithm to compute a basis of $Z (L)$ as a $C [L]$-module. Our approach combines results by K. Goodearl in 1985 with solving the systems of equations of the stationary Gelfand-Dickey (GD) hierarchy, which after substituting the coefficients of $L$ become linear, and whose solution sets form a flag of constants. We are assuming that the coefficients of $L$ belong to a differential algebraic extension $K$ of $C$. In addition, by considering parametric coefficients we develop an algorithm to generate families of ODOs with non trivial centralizer, in particular algebro-geometric, whose coefficients are solutions in $K$ of systems of the stationary GD hierarchy.</description>

      <title>On some admissible lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores applications of the so-called Freese's technique, a classical approach to study the congruence variety of a given algebra. We leverage this tool to investigate lattices that are admissible as congruence sublattice of a given algebra. In particular, we present a novel characterization of congruence modular varieties, Taylor varieties, and varieties satisfying a non-trivial congruence identity by means of lattice omission.</description>

      <title>Simple closed curves, non-kernel homology and Magnus embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the subspace of the homology of a covering space spanned by lifts of simple closed curves. Our main result is the existence of unbranched covers of surfaces where this is a proper subspace. More generally, for a fixed finite solvable quotient of the fundamental group we exhibit a cover whose homology is not generated by the lifts of curves in the complement of its kernel. We explain how the existing approach of Malestein and Putman (for branched covers) relates to the Magnus embedding, and by doing so we simplify their construction. We then generalise it to unbranched covers by producing embeddings of surface groups into units of certain graded associative algebras, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Realization of spaces of commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the use of topological methods to study collections of rings between an integral domain and its quotient field, we examine spaces of subrings of a commutative ring, where these spaces are endowed with the Zariski or patch topologies. We introduce three notions to study such a space $X$: patch bundles, patch presheaves and patch algebras. When $X$ is compact and Hausdorff, patch bundles give a way to approximate $X$ with topologically more tractable spaces, namely Stone spaces. Patch presheaves encode the space $X$ into stalks of a presheaf of rings over a Boolean algebra, thus giving a more geometrical setting for studying $X$. To both objects, a patch bundle and a patch presheaf, we associate what we call a patch algebra, a commutative ring that efficiently realizes the rings in $X$ as factor rings, or even localizations, and whose structure reflects various properties of the rings in $X$.</description>

Abstract: We study some variants of Verma modules of basic Lie superalgebras obtained via changing Borel subalgebras. These allow us to demonstrate that the principal block of \(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)\) is realized as (non-Serre) full subcategories of any atypical block of BGG category \( \mathcal{O} \) of basic Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Finite GK-dimensional pre-Nichols algebras and quasi-quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the classification of finite GK-dimensional pre-Nichols algebras in the twisted Yetter-Drinfeld module category $_{\k G}^{\k G} \mathcal{YD}^\Phi$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group and $\Phi$ is a $3$-cocycle on $G$. These algebras naturally arise from quasi-quantum groups over finite abelian groups. We prove that all pre-Nichols algebras of nondiagonal type in $_{\k G}^{\k G} \mathcal{YD}^\Phi$ are infinite GK-dimensional, and every graded pre-Nichols algebra in $_{\k G}^{\k G} \mathcal{YD}^\Phi$ with finite GK-dimension is twist equivalent to a graded pre-Nichols algebra in an ordinary Yetter-Drinfeld module category $_{\k \mathbb{G}}^{\k \mathbb{G}} \mathcal{YD}$, where $\mathbb{G}$ is a finite abelian group determined by $G$. In particular, we obtain a complete classification of finite GK-dimensonal Nichols algebras of finite-dimensional objects in $_{\k G}^{\k G} \mathcal{YD}^\Phi$. Let $V\in {_{\k G}^{\k G} \mathcal{YD}^\Phi}$ be a finite-dimensional object, we prove that the Nichols algebra $B(V)$ is finite GK-dimensional if and only if it is of diagonal type and the corresponding root system is finite, i.e., an arithmetic root system. Via bosonization, this yields a large class of infinite quasi-quantum groups over finite abelian groups.</description>
