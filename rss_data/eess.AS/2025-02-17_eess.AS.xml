      <title>Microphone Array Geometry Independent Multi-Talker Distant ASR: NTT System for the DASR Task of the CHiME-8 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-talker distant automatic speech recognition (DASR) system we designed for the DASR task 1 of the CHiME-8 challenge. Our system performs speaker counting, diarization, and ASR. It handles various recording conditions, from diner parties to professional meetings and from two to eight speakers. We perform diarization first, followed by speech enhancement, and then ASR as the challenge baseline. However, we introduced several key refinements. First, we derived a powerful speaker diarization relying on end-to-end speaker diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC), multi-channel speaker counting using enhanced embeddings from EEND-VC, and target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD). For speech enhancement, we introduced a novel microphone selection rule to better select the most relevant microphones among the distributed microphones and investigated improvements to beamforming. Finally, for ASR, we developed several models exploiting Whisper and WavLM speech foundation models. We present the results we submitted to the challenge and updated results we obtained afterward. Our strongest system achieves a 63% relative macro tcpWER improvement over the baseline and outperforms the challenge best results on the NOTSOFAR-1 meeting evaluation data among geometry-independent systems.</description>

      <title>SIToBI - A Speech Prosody Annotation Tool for Indian Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of prosodic information from speech signals is useful in a wide range of applications. However, deriving this information from speech signals can be a laborious task involving manual intervention. Therefore, the current work focuses on developing a tool that can provide prosodic annotations corresponding to a given speech signal, particularly for Indian languages. The proposed Segmentation with Intensity, Tones and Break Indices (SIToBI) tool provides time-aligned phoneme, syllable, and word transcriptions, syllable-level pitch contour annotations, break indices, and syllable-level relative intensity indices. The tool focuses more on syllable-level annotations since Indian languages are syllable-timed. Indians, regardless of the language they speak, may exhibit influences from other languages. As a result, other languages spoken in India may also exhibit syllable-timed characteristics. The accuracy of the annotations derived from the tool is analyzed by comparing them against manual annotations and the tool is observed to perform well. While the current work focuses on three languages, namely, Tamil, Hindi, and Indian English, the tool can easily be extended to other Indian languages and possibly other syllable-timed languages as well.</description>

      <title>Improving Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Keyboards Using Transformers and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09782v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of microphones in everyday devices and the growing reliance on online services have amplified the risk of acoustic side-channel attacks (ASCAs) targeting keyboards. This study explores deep learning techniques, specifically vision transformers (VTs) and large language models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of such attacks. We present substantial improvements over prior research, with the CoAtNet model achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our CoAtNet shows a 5.0% improvement for keystrokes recorded via smartphone (Phone) and 5.9% for those recorded via Zoom compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate transformer architectures and language models, with the best VT model matching CoAtNet's performance. A key advancement is the introduction of a noise mitigation method for real-world scenarios. By using LLMs for contextual understanding, we detect and correct erroneous keystrokes in noisy environments, enhancing ASCA performance. Additionally, fine-tuned lightweight language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) deliver comparable performance to heavyweight models with 67X more parameters. This integration of VTs and LLMs improves the practical applicability of ASCA mitigation, marking the first use of these technologies to address ASCAs and error correction in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Preliminary Exploration with GPT-4o Voice Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of multimodal large language models, GPT-4o stands out as a pioneering model, driving us to evaluate its capabilities. This report assesses GPT-4o across various tasks to analyze its audio processing and reasoning abilities. We find that GPT-4o exhibits strong knowledge in audio, speech, and music understanding, performing well in tasks like intent classification, spoken command classification, semantic and grammatical reasoning., multilingual speech recognition, and singing analysis. It also shows greater robustness against hallucinations than other large audio-language models (LALMs). However, it struggles with tasks such as audio duration prediction and instrument classification. Additionally, GPT-4o's safety mechanisms cause it to decline tasks like speaker identification, age classification, MOS prediction, and audio deepfake detection. Notably, the model exhibits a significantly different refusal rate when responding to speaker verification tasks on different datasets. This is likely due to variations in the accompanying instructions or the quality of the input audio, suggesting the sensitivity of its built-in safeguards. Finally, we acknowledge that model performance varies with evaluation protocols. This report only serves as a preliminary exploration of the current state of LALMs.</description>

      <title>InterGridNet: An Electric Network Frequency Approach for Audio Source Location Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel framework, called InterGridNet, is introduced, leveraging a shallow RawNet model for geolocation classification of Electric Network Frequency (ENF) signatures in the SP Cup 2016 dataset. During data preparation, recordings are sorted into audio and power groups based on inherent characteristics, further divided into 50 Hz and 60 Hz groups via spectrogram analysis. Residual blocks within the classification model extract frame-level embeddings, aiding decision-making through softmax activation. The topology and the hyperparameters of the shallow RawNet are optimized using a Neural Architecture Search. The overall accuracy of InterGridNet in the test recordings is 92%, indicating its effectiveness against the state-of-the-art methods tested in the SP Cup 2016. These findings underscore InterGridNet's effectiveness in accurately classifying audio recordings from diverse power grids, advancing state-of-the-art geolocation estimation methods.</description>

      <title>MTLM: an Innovative Language Model Training Paradigm for ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training Transformer-based language models (LMs) on a large amount of text has proven crucial for improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. Generally, traditional LMs are unidirectional and unable to access the context on the right. This paper proposes a method for training LMs that enable traditional unidirectional LMs to fully utilize left and right contexts. Compared with the unidirectional LMs, our LM facilitates ASR to transcribe hypotheses more consistently and in a more semantically unambiguous way, as it incorporates richer contextual representations. Finally, our experimental results on the LibriSpeech corpus demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional unidirectional LMs, whether n-best rescoring or shallow fusion is used as the decoding algorithm.</description>

      <title>Video Soundtrack Generation by Aligning Emotions and Temporal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EMSYNC, a video-based symbolic music generation model that aligns music with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate and align musical chords with scene cuts. Unlike existing models, our approach retains event-based encoding, ensuring fine-grained timing control and expressive musical nuances. We also propose a mapping scheme to bridge the video emotion classifier, which produces discrete emotion categories, with the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, which operates on continuous-valued valence-arousal inputs. In subjective listening tests, EMSYNC outperforms state-of-the-art models across all subjective metrics, for music theory-aware participants as well as the general listeners.</description>

      <title>VocalCrypt: Novel Active Defense Against Deepfake Voice Based on Masking Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in AI voice cloning, fueled by machine learning, have significantly impacted text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) fields. While these developments have led to notable progress, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of AI VC technology, causing economic losses and negative public perceptions. To address this challenge, this study focuses on creating active defense mechanisms against AI VC systems.
  We propose a novel active defense method, VocalCrypt, which embeds pseudo-timbre (jamming information) based on SFS into audio segments that are imperceptible to the human ear, thereby forming systematic fragments to prevent voice cloning. This approach protects the voice without compromising its quality. In comparison to existing methods, such as adversarial noise incorporation, VocalCrypt significantly enhances robustness and real-time performance, achieving a 500\% increase in generation speed while maintaining interference effectiveness.
  Unlike audio watermarking techniques, which focus on post-detection, our method offers preemptive defense, reducing implementation costs and enhancing feasibility. Extensive experiments using the Zhvoice and VCTK Corpus datasets show that our AI-cloned speech defense system performs excellently in automatic speaker verification (ASV) tests while preserving the integrity of the protected audio.</description>

      <title>CLaMP 3: Universal Music Information Retrieval Across Unaligned Modalities and Unseen Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10362v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLaMP 3 is a unified framework developed to address challenges of cross-modal and cross-lingual generalization in music information retrieval. Using contrastive learning, it aligns all major music modalities--including sheet music, performance signals, and audio recordings--with multilingual text in a shared representation space, enabling retrieval across unaligned modalities with text as a bridge. It features a multilingual text encoder adaptable to unseen languages, exhibiting strong cross-lingual generalization. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation, we curated M4-RAG, a web-scale dataset consisting of 2.31 million music-text pairs. This dataset is enriched with detailed metadata that represents a wide array of global musical traditions. To advance future research, we release WikiMT-X, a benchmark comprising 1,000 triplets of sheet music, audio, and richly varied text descriptions. Experiments show that CLaMP 3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MIR tasks, significantly surpassing previous strong baselines and demonstrating excellent generalization in multimodal and multilingual music contexts.</description>

      <title>OWLS: Scaling Laws for Multilingual Speech Recognition and Translation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws offer valuable insights for designing robust sequence processing architectures. While these laws have been extensively characterized in other modalities, their behavior in speech remains comparatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce OWLS, an open-access, reproducible suite of multilingual speech recognition and translation models spanning 0.25B to 18B parameters, with the 18B version being the largest speech model, to the best of our knowledge. OWLS leverages up to 360K hours of public speech data across 150 languages, enabling a systematic investigation into how data, model, and compute scaling each influence performance in multilingual speech tasks. We use OWLS to derive neural scaling laws, showing how final performance can be reliably predicted when scaling. One of our key findings is that scaling enhances performance on low-resource languages/dialects, helping to mitigate bias and improve the accessibility of speech technologies. Finally, we show how OWLS can be used to power new research directions by discovering emergent abilities in large-scale speech models. Model checkpoints will be released on https://huggingface.co/collections/espnet/owls-scaling-laws-for-speech-recognition-and-translation-67ab7f991c194065f057ce8d for future studies.</description>

      <title>Performance and Robustness of Signal-Dependent vs. Signal-Independent Binaural Signal Matching with Wearable Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of spatial audio in applications such as teleconferencing, entertainment, and virtual reality has led to the recent developments of binaural reproduction methods. However, only a few of these methods are well-suited for wearable and mobile arrays, which typically consist of a small number of microphones. One such method is binaural signal matching (BSM), which has been shown to produce high-quality binaural signals for wearable arrays. However, BSM may be suboptimal in cases of high direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR) as it is based on the diffuse sound field assumption. To overcome this limitation, previous studies incorporated sound-field models other than diffuse. However, performance may be sensitive to signal estimation errors. This paper aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive analysis of signal-dependent vs. signal-independent BSM, so that the benefits and limitations of the methods become clearer. Two signal-dependent BSM-based methods designed for high DRR scenarios that incorporate a sound field model composed of direct and reverberant components are investigated mathematically, using simulations, and finally validated by a listening test, and compared to the signal-independent BSM. The results show that signal-dependent BSM can significantly improve performance, in particular in the direction of the source, while presenting only a negligible degradation in other directions. Furthermore, when source direction estimation is inaccurate, performance of of the signal-dependent BSM degrade to equal that of the signal-independent BSM, presenting a desired robustness quality.</description>

      <title>CR-CTC: Consistency regularization on CTC for improved speech recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a widely used method for automatic speech recognition (ASR), renowned for its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, it often falls short in recognition performance. In this work, we propose the Consistency-Regularized CTC (CR-CTC), which enforces consistency between two CTC distributions obtained from different augmented views of the input speech mel-spectrogram. We provide in-depth insights into its essential behaviors from three perspectives: 1) it conducts self-distillation between random pairs of sub-models that process different augmented views; 2) it learns contextual representation through masked prediction for positions within time-masked regions, especially when we increase the amount of time masking; 3) it suppresses the extremely peaky CTC distributions, thereby reducing overfitting and improving the generalization ability. Extensive experiments on LibriSpeech, Aishell-1, and GigaSpeech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CR-CTC. It significantly improves the CTC performance, achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to those attained by transducer or systems combining CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder (CTC/AED). We release our code at https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall.</description>

      <title>Artifact-free Sound Quality in DNN-based Closed-loop Systems for Audio Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly improved various audio processing applications, including speech enhancement, synthesis, and hearing aid algorithms. DNN-based closed-loop systems have gained popularity in these applications due to their robust performance and ability to adapt to diverse conditions. Despite their effectiveness, current DNN-based closed-loop systems often suffer from sound quality degradation caused by artifacts introduced by suboptimal sampling methods. To address this challenge, we introduce dCoNNear, a novel DNN architecture designed for seamless integration into closed-loop frameworks. This architecture specifically aims to prevent the generation of spurious artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of dCoNNear through a proof-of-principle example within a closed-loop framework that employs biophysically realistic models of auditory processing for both normal and hearing-impaired profiles to design personalized hearing aid algorithms. Our results show that dCoNNear not only accurately simulates all processing stages of existing non-DNN biophysical models but also eliminates audible artifacts, thereby enhancing the sound quality of the resulting hearing aid algorithms. This study presents a novel, artifact-free closed-loop framework that improves the sound quality of audio processing systems, offering a promising solution for high-fidelity applications in audio and hearing technologies.</description>

      <title>DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</description>

      <title>Less is More for Synthetic Speech Detection in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by advances in self-supervised learning for speech, state-of-the-art synthetic speech detectors have achieved low error rates on popular benchmarks such as ASVspoof. However, prior benchmarks do not address the wide range of real-world variability in speech. Are reported error rates realistic in real-world conditions? To assess detector failure modes and robustness under controlled distribution shifts, we introduce ShiftySpeech, a benchmark with more than 3000 hours of synthetic speech from 7 domains, 6 TTS systems, 12 vocoders, and 3 languages. We found that all distribution shifts degraded model performance, and contrary to prior findings, training on more vocoders, speakers, or with data augmentation did not guarantee better generalization. In fact, we found that training on less diverse data resulted in better generalization, and that a detector fit using samples from a single carefully selected vocoder and a small number of speakers, without data augmentations, achieved state-of-the-art results on the challenging In-the-Wild benchmark.</description>

      <title>ASVspoof 5: Design, Collection and Validation of Resources for Spoofing, Deepfake, and Adversarial Attack Detection Using Crowdsourced Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ASVspoof 5 is the fifth edition in a series of challenges which promote the study of speech spoofing and deepfake attacks as well as the design of detection solutions. We introduce the ASVspoof 5 database which is generated in crowdsourced fashion from data collected in diverse acoustic conditions (cf. studio-quality data for earlier ASVspoof databases) and from ~2,000 speakers (cf. ~100 earlier). The database contains attacks generated with 32 different algorithms, also crowdsourced, and optimised to varying degrees using new surrogate detection models. Among them are attacks generated with a mix of legacy and contemporary text-to-speech synthesis and voice conversion models, in addition to adversarial attacks which are incorporated for the first time. ASVspoof 5 protocols comprise seven speaker-disjoint partitions. They include two distinct partitions for the training of different sets of attack models, two more for the development and evaluation of surrogate detection models, and then three additional partitions which comprise the ASVspoof 5 training, development and evaluation sets. An auxiliary set of data collected from an additional 30k speakers can also be used to train speaker encoders for the implementation of attack algorithms. Also described herein is an experimental validation of the new ASVspoof 5 database using a set of automatic speaker verification and spoof/deepfake baseline detectors. With the exception of protocols and tools for the generation of spoofed/deepfake speech, the resources described in this paper, already used by participants of the ASVspoof 5 challenge in 2024, are now all freely available to the community.</description>

      <title>MEMS and ECM Sensor Technologies for Cardiorespiratory Sound Monitoring - A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of cardiorespiratory auscultation sensing devices (i.e., stethoscopes), which is useful for understanding the theoretical aspects and practical design notes. In this paper, we first introduce the acoustic properties of the heart and lungs, as well as a brief history of stethoscope evolution. Then, we discuss the basic concept of electret condenser microphones (ECMs) and a stethoscope based on them. Then, we discuss the microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) technology, particularly focusing on piezoelectric transducer sensors. This paper comprehensively reviews sensing technologies for cardiorespiratory auscultation, emphasizing MEMS-based wearable designs in the past decade. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to summarize ECM and MEMS applications for heart and lung sound analysis.</description>
