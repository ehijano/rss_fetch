      <title>Optical Screening of Citrus Leaf Diseases Using Label-Free Spectroscopic Tools: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citrus diseases pose threats to citrus farming and result in economic losses worldwide. Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and, immunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are laborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and contamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising alternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and demonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for disease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical spectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial phases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and commercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental working principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and limitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic imaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in citrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of optical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field measurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf spectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including future insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover, the role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools for spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus leaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging compositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant leaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development and commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid and early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.</description>

      <title>Nano/micro-plastics effects in agricultural landscapes: an overlooked threat to pollination, biological pest control, and food security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biodiversity-associated ecosystem services such as pollination and biocontrol may be severely affected by emerging nano/micro-plastics (NMP) pollution. We synthesized the little-explored effects of NMP on pollinators and biocontrol agents on the organismal, farm and landscape scale. For instance ingested NMP trigger organismal changes from gene expression, organ damage to behavior modifications. At the farm and landscape level, NMP will likely amplify synergistic effects with other threats such as pathogens and antibiotics, and may alter landscape properties such as floral resource distributions in high NMP concentration areas, what we call NMP islands. It is essential to understand the functional exposure pathways of NMP on pollinators and biocontrol agents to comprehensively evaluate the risks for agricultural ecosystems and global food security.</description>
