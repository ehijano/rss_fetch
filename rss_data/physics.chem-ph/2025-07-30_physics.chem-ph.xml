      <title>Development and experimental validation of a mathematical model for fluoride-removal filters comprising chemically treated mineral rich carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excessive fluoride intake can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis, among other health issues. Naturally occurring fluoride and industrial runoff can result in concentrations far exceeding the World Health Organization's recommended limits in water supplies. In this study, we derive a model incorporating the dominant mechanisms governing fluoride removal from drinking water using the two adsorbents mineral-rich carbon (MRC) and chemically treated mineral-rich carbon (TMRC). Using both new and previously published experimental data, we validate the model for MRC, TMRC, and their mixture, using both batch and column data. Despite the filters containing approximately 40:1 MRC:TMRC ratio by mass, we find that TMRC dominates fluoride removal, while MRC contributes at early and late times. The full column model, which uses parameters from isotherm batch studies, achieves excellent agreement with experimental breakthrough data across varying inlet concentrations and flow rates (R$^2&gt;0.991$, SSE$&lt;0.0632$). Motivated by this, we propose a reduced model based solely on TMRC adsorption, with a single fitting parameter, which still performs well across all breakthrough curves (R$^2 &gt; 0.983$, SSE $&lt;0.117$). The simplicity of this model means that it is straightforward and inexpensive to work with numerically. In both models, batch and column behaviours are reconciled and, for the case of breakthrough curves with varying inlet concentrations, a set of globally optimised parameters is found. The strong agreement with experimental data supports the model's robustness and reinforces the physical interpretability of its parameters. These models for MRC and TMRC provide a foundation for filter optimisation and future efforts aimed at improving fluoride removal in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Dissociative Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis via Electrodeposited Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical ammonia synthesis via lithium-mediated nitrogen dissociation has demonstrated exceptional Faradaic efficiency at ambient conditions, but its viability is limited by a high energy cost of ~9.12 eV per NH3 via lithium electrodeposition. Here, we establish the thermodynamic limits for dissociative nitrogen reduction using elemental metals by decomposing the process into three steps: metal deposition, nitridation, and protonation. We derive energetic constraints that any viable mediator must satisfy and show that highly reducing metals impose significant energetic penalties. To reduce this cost, we explore solvent tuning and bimetallic alloy strategies that shift deposition potentials without compromising nitridation spontaneity. Our results offer design principles for lowering the energy input of dissociative nitrogen reduction while maintaining its selectivity advantage over associative routes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Isoreticular Series of CALF-20 for Biogas Upgrading using a Pressure/Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA), have emerged as a promising technology for upgrading biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for deployment of high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2 selectivity, thermal and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating molecular simulations and PVSA cycle optimization. Structural parameters such as pore volume, pore size, and isosteric adsorption enthalpy were first calculated, followed by atomistic grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Process-level performances of the six materials were evaluated and optimized using the Thompson Sampling Efficient Multi-objective Optimization (TSEMO) algorithm. From the process-level optimization, we found that FumCALF-20 is the only material that can reach CH4 purity &gt; 0.90 while maintaining high recovery. Other materials either lacked sufficient CO2 capacity or showed inefficient CH4 desorption at low pressures. This study underscores the value of process-level optimization in MOF evaluation and screening for energy-efficient biogas upgrading.</description>

      <title>Polyurethane-Inspired CO2 Chemisorbent: Ab Initio Reaction Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyurethane (PU) and its numerous fine-tuned derivatives are widely employed as CO2 scavengers thanks to (1) physisorption and (2) functionalization of the PU backbone with other CO2 sorbents. In the present work, it has been unraveled why PU cannot exhibit CO2 chemisorption, despite possessing the nitrogen docking sites and exhibiting strong electrostatic sorbent-sorbate interactions. Furthermore, a few types of spatial separation of the active sorption sites have been proposed to unleash the chemisorption functionality of PU. By comparing various structural modifications of PU by using the in-silico methodology, we have identified that CO2 chemisorption by PU takes place in the case of implementing methyl and ethyl fragments between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of PU. Herewith, the introduction of the ethyl moiety even makes CO2 chemisorption energetically favorable relative to physisorption. The reported specific progress on materials design represents an obvious practical value for chemical engineers developing inexpensive CO2 scavengers.</description>

      <title>Molecular Mechanisms of Polymer Crosslinking via Thermal Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing efficient and universal polymer crosslinking strategies is pivotal for advanced material design, especially for challenging matrixes like polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Traditional crosslinkers such as divinylbenzene (DVB) often requires high-temperature radical initiators and are limited by poor compatibility with saturated hydrocarbon matrices. In contrast, bis-diazirine (BD) crosslinkers offer a promising alternative by harnessing thermally or photochemically generated carbene intermediates for highly selective C-H bond insertions. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS. We demonstrate that BD enables efficient covalent linkage through low free energy barriers , facilitating crosslinking at moderate temperatures without catalysts and with minimal sensitivity to polymer chain length. Moreover, BD exhibits selective reactivity towards the tertiary and secondary C-H bonds in PP and PS, respectively. Comparative analysis shows that BD dramatically outperforms DVB, especially in saturated polymers, enabling reaction times that are orders of magnitude faster. Our findings provide atomistic insights into BD crosslinker reactivity and establish a mechanistic foundation for next-generation, universal C-H activation-based crosslinking technologies.</description>

      <title>Shadow excited state molecular dynamics with the \DeltaSCF method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the shadow extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (XL-BOMD) method to excited state molecular dynamics (ESMD) in the context of \DeltaSCF Kohn-Sham density functional theory, with demonstrations performed using self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) theory. In this shadow ESMD approach, the approximate iterative solution to the exact potential in conventional ESMD is replaced by an exact single-step solution to an approximate shadow excited-state potential. We show that in addition to offering significant improvement in computational cost relative to direct ESMD, our shadow ESMD method provides enhanced stability and robustness relative to its 'exact' counterpart. Our implementation is carried out in the context of SCC-DFTB theory but should be broadly generalizable, both to {\textit{ab initio}} electronic structure methods and to other semi-empirical quantum chemistry approaches.</description>

      <title>Vibronic spectra at nonzero temperatures from Herman-Kluk coherence thermofield dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the semiclassical Herman--Kluk approximation with the coherence thermofield dynamics in order to evaluate vibrationally resolved electronic spectra at nonzero temperatures. In coherence thermofield dynamics, the dipole time correlation function is rewritten exactly as a wavepacket autocorrelation function, and the corresponding wavepacket is a solution to a zero-temperature time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation on an augmented configuration space of doubled dimension. We derive the Herman--Kluk representation for the thermofield wavepacket autocorrelation function and demonstrate how it can be computed from individual trajectories. To analyze this method, we compare spectra of Morse potentials of increasing anharmonicity evaluated at various temperatures with a numerically exact approach, with the Herman--Kluk coherence thermofield dynamics, and with the single-trajectory thawed Gaussian coherence thermofield dynamics. At low anharmonicity, both approximate methods yield accurate spectra. However, in a Morse potential with higher anharmonicity, the thawed Gaussian thermofield dynamics, based on the local harmonic approximation, fails to capture emerging hot bands, whereas the Herman--Kluk thermofield approach successfully reproduces them.</description>

      <title>Refined approach to cellularization: going from Heller's thawed Gaussian approximation to the Herman--Kluk propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a refined cellularization (Filinov filtering) scheme for the semiclassical Herman--Kluk propagator, which employs the inverse Weierstrass transform and optimal scaling of the cell's size with the number of cells, and was previously used only in the context of the dephasing representation. In the new methodology, the sampling density for the cell centers correlates with the cell size, allowing for an effective sampling of the phase space covered by the initial state of the system. The main advantage of the presented approach is that, unlike the standard cellularization, it converges to the original Herman--Kluk result in the limit of an infinite number of trajectories and to the thawed Gaussian approximation when a single trajectory is used. We illustrate the performance of the refined cellularization scheme by calculating autocorrelation functions and spectra of both integrable and chaotic model systems.</description>

      <title>On the Discretization Error of the Discrete Generalized Quantum Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer tensor method (TTM) [Cerrillo and Cao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014, 112, 110401] can be considered a discrete-time formulation of the Nakajima-Zwanzig quantum master equation (NZ-QME) for modeling non-Markovian quantum dynamics. A recent paper [Makri, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 5037] raised concerns regarding the consistency of the TTM discretization, particularly a spurious term at the initial time \( t=0 \). This Communication presents a detailed analysis of the discretization structure of TTM, clarifying the origin of the initial-time correction and establishing a consistent relationship between the TTM discrete-time memory kernel \( K_N \), and the continuous-time NZ-QME kernel \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \). This relationship is validated numerically using the spin-boson model, demonstrating convergence of reconstructed memory kernels and accurate dynamical evolution as \( \Delta t \to 0 \). While TTM provides a consistent discretization, we note that alternative schemes are also viable, such as the midpoint derivative/midpoint integral scheme proposed in Makri's work. The relative performance of various schemes for either computing accurate \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \) from exact dynamics, or obtaining accurate dynamics from exact \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \), warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of Molecules from Real-Time Propagation Based on the Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time propagation method for computing linear and nonlinear optical properties of molecules based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The method follows the time evolution of the one-particle density matrix under an external electric field. We include electron-electron interaction effects through a self-energy based on the screened exchange approximation. Quasiparticle energies are taken from a prior $GW$ calculation to construct the effective single-particle Hamiltonian and we represent all operators and wavefunctions in an atom-centered Gaussian basis. We benchmark the accuracy of the real-time propagation against the standard linear-response Bethe-Salpeter equation using a set of organic molecules. We find very good agreement when computing linear-response isotropic polarizability spectra from both approaches, with a mean absolute deviation of 30~meV in peak positions. Beyond linear response, we simulate second harmonic generation and optical rectification in a non-centrosymmetric molecule. These phenomena are not captured by the commonly used linear-response Bethe-Salpeter equation. We foresee broad applicability of real-time propagation based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the study of linear and nonlinear optical properties of molecules as the method has a similar computational cost as time-dependent density functional theory with hybrid functionals.</description>

      <title>What exactly is 'active matter'?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the study of active matter has developed into one of the most rapidly growing subfields of condensed matter physics, more and more kinds of physical systems have been included in this framework. While the word 'active' is often thought of as referring to self-propelled particles, it is also applied to a large variety of other systems such as non-polar active nematics or certain particles with non-reciprocal interactions. Developing novel forms of active matter, as attempted, e.g., in the framework of quantum active matter, requires a clear idea of what active matter is. Here, we critically discuss how the understanding of active matter has changed over time, what precisely a definition of 'active matter' can look like, and to what extent it is (still) possible to define active matter in a way that covers all systems that are commonly understood as active matter while distinguishing them from other driven systems. Moreover, we discuss the definition of an 'active field theory', where 'active' is used as an attribute of a theoretical model rather than of a physical system. We show that the usage of the term 'active' requires agreement on a coarse-grained viewpoint. We discuss the meaning of 'active' both in general terms and via the specific examples of chemically driven particles, ultrasound-driven particles, active nematics, particles with non-reciprocal interactions, intracellular phase separation, and quantum active matter.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation under electronic strong coupling: A time-dependent combined quantum electrodynamics/quantum chemistry study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The creation of light-matter hybrid states, polaritons, in a cavity offers new intriguing opportunities to manipulate the electronic structure and electron dynamics of atoms and molecules. Here, we investigate the effect of electronic strong coupling (ESC) between atoms or molecules and field modes of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity on High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) spectra within a theoretical model study. We assume that the atom or molecule is driven by an intense classical laser field, giving rise to HHG, while being strongly coupled to quantized cavity modes as described by the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the framework of molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED). Specifically, as a test case, we first consider a model Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional hydrogen atom coupled to a cavity mode, which can be treated ``numerically exact'' using grid methods. Further, a hydrogen molecule coupled to a cavity mode is considered and treated within a recently suggested QED-TD-CI (Quantum Electrodynamics Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction) method [Weidman $\textit{et al.}$, J. Chem. Phys. $\textbf{160}$, 094111 (2024)]. The resulting HHG spectra show (i) a suppression of the harmonic cutoff in line with excitation of quantum light in the cavity and, in some cases, (ii) enhancement of some harmonics of the coupled light-matter system.</description>

      <title>Investigating CO Adsorption on Cu(111) and Rh(111) Surfaces Using Machine Learning Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "CO adsorption puzzle", a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations (GGA) in density functional theory to replicate CO's experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The above work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.</description>

      <title>Laser-Synthesized Amorphous PdSe$_{\mathrm{2-x}}$ Nanoparticles: A Defect-Rich Platform for High-Efficiency SERS, Photocatalysis, and Photothermal Conversion</title>

Abstract: The control of material properties at the atomic scale remains a central challenge in materials science. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer remarkable electronic and optical properties, but their functionality is largely dictated by their stable crystalline phases. Here we demonstrate a single-step, ligand-free strategy using femtosecond laser ablation in liquid to transform crystalline, stoichiometric palladium diselenide (PdSe$_{\mathrm{2}}$) into highly stable, amorphous, and non-stoichiometric nanoparticles (PdSe$_{\mathrm{2-x}}$, with x$\approx$1). This laser-driven amorphization creates a high density of selenium vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated sites, which unlock a range of emergent functions absent in the crystalline precursor, including plasmon-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering with an enhancement factor exceeding 10$^\mathrm{6}$, a 50-fold increase in photocatalytic activity, and near-infrared photothermal conversion efficiency reaching 83$\%$. Our findings establish laser-induced amorphization as a powerful top-down approach for defect-engineered TMDCs and advances their practical usage in optics, catalysis, and nanomedicine.</description>

      <title>Following the Committor Flow: A Data-Driven Discovery of Transition Pathways</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.</description>

      <title>Superhydrogenation of indene at low temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is crucial to understanding molecular hydrogenation formation in the interstellar medium. This process also helps to elucidate the weakening of the aromatic bonds in PAHs, which may function as a carbon reservoir. Tunneling can significantly promote the hydrogenation process in a low to moderate temperature range. We present the hydrogenation sequence of the newly observed PAH molecule, indene, and clarify the tunneling rule at temperature in photodissociation region (PDR) and dark molecular cloud conditions. In addition, we report fit parameters to be utilized in astronomical modeling. The hydrogenation sequence was studied using simple hydrogenation rules and confirmed by barriers from density functional theory (DFT). To make our kinetic studies useful to modelers, we implemented a Monte Carlo method based program to generate and optimize random initial fit parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, and T0) to achieve the statistically best fit. We find that indene hydrogenation follows rules similar to those of other PAHs, such as pentacene, coronene, and corannulene, with binding energies for odd numbered hydrogenation steps ranging from 0.5 to 2 eV and barriers around 0.13 eV for the first, fifth, and seventh hydrogenation steps. The third hydrogenation step is the rate limiting step, similar to what is found for other PAHs. Even numbered hydrogenation steps have lower barriers and lead to more stable intermediates as a result of radical recombinations. The hydrogenation sequence follows a scheme that strongly depends on the PAH's shape, the number of aromatic rings, and the presence of five membered rings. Furthermore, we observe that tunneling plays an important role in the hydrogenation of indene at temperatures between 30 and 75 K, which corresponds to the temperatures of dust in PDRs.</description>

Abstract: The conductivity of concentrated salt solutions has posed a real puzzle for theories of electrolytes. Despite a quantitative understanding of dilute solutions, an analytical theory for concentrated ones remains a challenge for almost a century, although a number of parameters and effects incorporated into theories increases with time. Here we show that the conductivity of univalent salt solutions can be perfectly interpreted using a simplest model that relies on a modified mean-field description of electrostatic interactions and on a classical approach to calculating colloid electrophoresis. We derive a compact equation, which predicts that the ratio of conductivity to that at an infinite dilution is the same for all salt and depends only on a product of the harmonic mean of ion hydrodynamic radii and the square root of concentration. Our equation fits very well the data for inorganic salts (up to a few mol/l), although at a very high dilution the relaxation correction seems necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the domain of image super-resolution, we view the electron density as a 3D grayscale image and use a convolutional residual network to transform a crude and trivially generated guess of the molecular density into an accurate ground-state quantum mechanical density. We find that this model outperforms all prior density prediction approaches. Because the input is itself a real-space density, the predictions are equivariant to molecular symmetry transformations even though the model is not constructed to be. Due to its simplicity, the model is directly applicable to unseen molecular conformations and chemical elements. We show that fine-tuning on limited new data provides high accuracy even in challenging cases of exotic elements and charge states. Our work suggests new routes to learning real-space physical quantities drawing from the established ideas of image processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying organic molecules with desirable properties from the extensive chemical space can be challenging, particularly when property evaluation methods are time-consuming and resource intensive. In this study, we illustrate this challenge by exploring the chemical space of large oligomers, constructed from monomeric building blocks, for potential use in organic photovoltaics (OPV). For this purpose, we developed a python package to search the chemical space using a building block approach: stk-search. We use stk-search to compare a variety of search algorithms, including those based upon Bayesian optimization and evolutionary approaches. Initially, we evaluated and compared the performance of different search algorithms within a precomputed search space. We then extended our investigation to the vast chemical space of molecules formed of 6 building blocks (6-mers), comprising over $10^{14}$ molecules. Notably, while some algorithms show only marginal improvements over a random search approach in a relatively small, precomputed, search space, their performance in the larger chemical space is orders of magnitude better. Specifically, Bayesian optimization identified a thousand times more promising molecules with the desired properties compared to random search, using the same computational resources.</description>

      <title>Oxidation States in Solids from Data-Driven Paradigms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The oxidation state (OS) is an essential chemical concept that embodies chemical intuition but cannot be computed with well-defined physical laws. We establish a data-driven paradigm, with its implementation as Tsinghua Oxidation States in Solids (TOSS), to explicitly compute the OSs in crystal structures as the emergent properties from large-sized datasets based on Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP). TOSS employs two looping structures over the large-sized dataset of crystal structures to obtain an emergent library of distance distributions as the foundation for chemically intuitive understanding and then determine the OSs by minimizing a loss function for each structure based on MAP and distance distributions in the whole dataset. The application of TOSS to a dataset of $\mathrm{&gt;}$1,000,000 crystal structures delivers a superior success rate, and using the resulting OSs as the dataset, we further train a data-driven alternative to TOSS based on graph convolutional networks. We expect TOSS and the ML-model-based alternative to find a wide spectrum of applications, and this work also demonstrates an encouraging example for the data-driven paradigms to explicitly compute the chemical intuition for tackling complex problems in chemistry.</description>

      <title>The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>

      <title>The Phase-Space Way To Electronic Structure Theory and Subsequently Chemical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-space electronic structure theory offers up a new and powerful approach for tackling problems with coupled nuclear-electronic dynamics in a fashion that goes beyond Born-Oppenheimer (BO) theory. Whereas BO theory stipulates that we consider electronic states parameterized by nuclear position $X$ only, i.e. molecular orbitals are functions of nuclear positions but not nuclear velocities, phase-space (PS) theory allows for electronic states to be parameterized by both nuclear position X and nuclear momentum $P$. As a result, within a phase-space approach, one can directly recover many new features, including electronic momentum and vibrational circular dichroism spectra. Moreover, phase-space electronic structure theory is exact for the hydrogen atom and, for a set of model problems, the method can even improve upon vibrational energies relative to BO theory. Perhaps most importantly, the phase-space approach offers up a very new perspective on spin physics, stipulating that molecules and materials with degenerate or nearly degenerate ground states (due to spin degeneracy) display broken-symmetry ground states in their phase-space potential energy surfaces. This last feature opens up very new possibilities for exploring spin chemistry (including the Einstein-de Haas effect and chiral induced spin selectivity) within the context of more established electronic structure theory. At the end of the day, in order to tackle electronic dynamical phenomena, especially subtle problems in magnetic chemistry, it will be essential for the electronic structure community to pivot towards diagonalizing $\hat H_{PS}(X, P)$ rather than $\hat H_{BO}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Locating Ab Initio Transition States via Approximate Geodesics on Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and reliable identification and optimization of transition state structures is a longstanding challenge in computational chemistry. Popular chain-of-states methods require hundreds if not thousands of ab initio calculations to generate initial guesses for local quasi-Newton optimizers, with persistent risk of collapse to an alternative stationary point on the potential energy surface (PES). Here, we show that high-quality guess structures for transition state optimization can be obtained by constructing the geodesic path between reactant and product structures on the PES generated by machine learning potentials (MLPs). We present an algorithm for optimization of such geodesic paths, as well as the associated codebase. We demonstrate effectiveness of this approach using the recent eSEN-sm-cons MLP. On average, the highest-energy point along these MLP geodesics requires 30% fewer quasi-Newton optimization steps to converge to the transition state compared to guesses from the fully ab initio frozen string method. Our approach therefore completely eliminates the need for ab initio calculations for generation of transition state guesses and considerably speeds up subsequent structural optimization. Geodesic construction on ML PES thus promises to be a useful approach for efficient computational elucidation of complex chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a standard approach for calculating optical excitations of molecules and solids, while ensemble DFT (EDFT) is a promising alternative under development. We introduce ensemble TDDFT (ETDDFT), a practical theory that combines the two, generalizing both; we ensemble-generalize the Gross-Kohn equation and the exchange-correlation kernel of TDDFT, and generalize EDFT to time-dependent problems. We relate coordinate scaling to the adiabatic connection. The new theory provides multiple avenues for constructing and using approximations. We illustrate these on the 2-site Hubbard model. We connect our results to the more general case of non-perturbative time-dependence.</description>
