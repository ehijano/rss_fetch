      <title>Particle collisions around static spherically symmetric black hole and rotating black hole in gravity's rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Banados-Silk-West effect to the static spherically symmetric black hole and rotating black hole in gravity's rainbow. Through systematic investigation that the effects of different rainbow functions on the center-of-mass energy of two test particles colliding outside the event horizon, we discussed the possibility of infinite center-of-mass energy Ecm and the corresponding motion parameters. By employing rainbow functions g0=g1=(1-E/EP)-1, infinite Ecm can be achieved through collisions occurring outside the event horizon, rather than being confined solely to collisions near the event horizon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bounce from the Quantum Exclusion Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fully relativistic spherical collapse model of a uniform distribution of mass $M$ with initial comoving radius $\chi_*$ and spatial curvature $k \equiv 1/\chi_k^2 \le 1/\chi_*^2$ representing an over-density or bounded perturbation within a larger background. Our model incorporates a perfect fluid with an evolving equation of state, $P = P(\rho)$, which asymptotically transitions from pressureless dust ($P = 0$) to a ground state characterized by a uniform, time-independent energy density $\rho_{\rm G}$. This transition is motivated by the quantum exclusion principle, which prevents singular collapse, as observed in supernova core-collapse explosions. We analytically demonstrate that this transition induces a gravitational bounce at a radius $R_{\rm B} = (8 \pi G \rho_{\rm G}/3)^{-1/2}$. The bounce leads to an exponential expansion phase, where $P(\rho)$ behaves effectively as an inflation potential. This model provides novel insights into black hole interiors and, when extended to a cosmological setting, predicts a small but non-zero closed spatial curvature: $ -0.07 \pm 0.02 \le \Omega_k &lt; 0$. This lower bound follows from the requirement of $\chi_k \ge \chi_* \simeq 15.9$ Gpc to address the cosmic microwave background low quadrupole anomaly. The bounce remains confined within the initial gravitational radius $r_{\rm S} = 2GM$, which effectively acts as a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ inside $r_{\rm S}=\sqrt{3/\Lambda}$ while still appearing as a Schwarzschild black hole from an external perspective. This framework unifies the origin of inflation and dark energy, with its key observational signature being the presence of small but nonzero spatial curvature, a testable prediction for upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "ringdown" radiation emitted by oscillating black holes has great scientific potential. By carefully predicting the frequencies and amplitudes of black hole quasinormal modes and comparing them with gravitational-wave data from compact binary mergers we can advance our understanding of the two-body problem in general relativity, verify the predictions of the theory in the regime of strong and dynamical gravitational fields, and search for physics beyond the Standard Model or new gravitational degrees of freedom. We summarize the state of the art in our understanding of black hole quasinormal modes in general relativity and modified gravity, their excitation, and the modeling of ringdown waveforms. We also review the status of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA ringdown observations, data analysis techniques, and the bright prospects of the field in the era of LISA and next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>How Many Times Should We Matched Filter Gravitational Wave Data? A Comparison of GstLAL's Online and Offline Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences employ a process called matched filtering, in which gravitational wave strain data is cross-correlated against a bank of waveform templates. Data from every observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration is typically analyzed in this way twice, first in a low-latency mode in which gravitational wave candidates are identified in near-real time, and later in a high-latency mode. Such high-latency analyses have traditionally been considered more sensitive, since background data from the full observing run is available for assigning significance to all candidates, as well as more robust, since they do not need to worry about keeping up with live data. In this work, we present a novel technique to use the matched filtering data products from a low-latency analysis and re-process them by assigning significances in a high-latency way, effectively removing the need to perform matched filtering a second time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we analyze 38 days of LIGO and Virgo data from the third observing run (O3) using the GstLAL pipeline, and show that our method is as sensitive and reliable as a traditional high-latency analysis. Since matched filtering represents the vast majority of computing time for a traditional analysis, our method greatly reduces the time and computational burden required to produce the same results as a traditional high-latency analysis. Consequently, it has already been adopted by GstLAL for the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Critical slowing down of black hole phase transition and kinetic crossover in supercritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-Anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) black holes in the extended phase space exhibit critical behavior analogous to the liquid-gas system, with critical exponents matching those of van der Waals-type phase transitions. However, the kinetics of these transitions near spinodal and critical points remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that both the autocorrelation time and the variance of trajectories increase significantly as the system approaches these special points, signaling critical slowing down. This behavior is driven by the flattening of the free energy landscape, as further confirmed by the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker-Planck equation. Moreover, we uncover a clear dynamical crossover separating gas-like and liquid-like regimes in the supercritical region. This kinetic crossover defines the Widom line that closely matches the thermodynamic one obtained from the maxima of the isobaric heat capacity. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the kinetics of RNAdS black holes in the vicinity of spinodal and critical points.</description>

      <title>Study of Curvature-Matter Coupling in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past century, General Relativity (GR) has been a cornerstone of gravitational theory. However, recent cosmological observations, such as the accelerated expansion of the Universe, challenge its completeness and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This has motivated the development of alternative approaches, including dynamical dark energy and modifications to gravity. This thesis investigates the $f(R, L_m)$ gravity framework, which extends $f(R)$ gravity by introducing curvature-matter coupling, to address unresolved issues in modern cosmology.
  Chapter 1 reviews the foundations of cosmology, GR, and $\Lambda$CDM, discussing their challenges and introducing modified gravity theories. Chapter 2 studies cosmic expansion in a specific non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ model, analyzing its dynamics using updated $H(z)$ and Pantheon datasets and demonstrating a deceleration-to-acceleration transition. Chapter 3 introduces a model-independent Hubble parameter parametrization and explores cosmological variables using MCMC and combined data. Chapter 4 incorporates bulk viscosity into $f(R, L_m)$ models to explain late-time acceleration and applies Om diagnostics and energy conditions. Chapter 5 examines non-singular matter bounce cosmologies, analyzing bouncing dynamics and the evolution of cosmographic parameters. Chapter 6 addresses gravitational baryogenesis and shows how $f(R, L_m)$ gravity supports the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Chapter 7 summarizes the results and suggests directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Covariant diffusion and drift of the stochastic GW background with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the covariant diffusion and drift of massless particles on the light cone within the context of quantum gravity phenomenology. Unlike modified dispersion relations that violate Lorentz invariance and grow with frequency, this model introduces a stochastic correction to the massless geodesic equation while preserving Lorentz invariance, and is dominant at lower frequencies due to the larger spacetime support of long-wavelength modes. The effect is phenomenologically described by just two diffusion and drift parameters, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, whose values are already constrained by measurements of the CMB blackbody spectrum. We show that a direct measurement and characterization of a gravitational wave (GW) background frequency spectrum can improve bounds on these diffusion and drift parameters by over 12 orders of magnitude compared to those from the CMB. In particular, we find that detecting a GW background sourced by realistic models of first-order phase transitions or primordial black holes (PBH) with LISA can constrain the parameters down to a value of $\kappa_1,\,\kappa_2\lesssim 10^{-56}\,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Likelihoods for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of likelihood functions used for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) searches. By dividing the data into many short segments, one customarily takes advantage of the Central Limit Theorem to justify a Gaussian crosscorrelation likelihood. We show, with a hierarchy of ever more realistic examples, beginning with a single frequency bin and one detector, and then moving to two and three detectors with white and colored signal and noise, that approximating the exact Whittle likelihood by various Gaussian alternatives can induce systematic biases in the estimation of the SGWB parameters. We derive several approximations for the full likelihood and identify regimes where Gaussianity breaks down. We also discuss the possibility of conditioning the full likelihood on fiducial noise estimates to produce unbiased SGWB parameter estimation. We show that for some segment durations and bandwidths, particularly in space-based and pulsar-timing arrays, the bias can exceed the statistical uncertainty. Our results provide practical guidance for segment choice, likelihood selection, and data-compression strategies to ensure robust SGWB inference in current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: The Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger, demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases, systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like general relativity, metric-affine gravity should be a viable effective quantum theory, otherwise it is a mathematical curiosity without physical application. Assuming a perturbative quantum field theory, the universal, flat limit of metric-affine gravity offers a good foundation for model-building only when symmetry constraints are themselves sufficient to get rid of ghosts and tachyons, without requiring any further tuning of the couplings. Using this symmetry-first criterion, we find that for parity-preserving models with a totally symmetric distortion, only massless spin-one and spin-three modes are possible besides the graviton. Moreover, no viable models result from gauge symmetries generated by a scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>The analytical general solutions of power-law inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power-law inflation has stood as a classical model in inflationary cosmology since the early 1980s, prized for its exact analytical solutions and ability to naturally resolve the Big Bang theory's horizon and flatness problems through exponential expansion. However, its simplest form appears incompatible with modern precision observations, motivating increasingly complex alternatives. In this work, we demonstrate previous predictions with Power-law inflation considered only a particular solution of the field equations, and derive the complete set of general analytical solutions that satisfy current theoretical and observational constraints. This finding revitalizes Power-law inflation as a viable framework, offering new possibilities for cosmological model-building while preserving its original mathematical elegance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search for Gravitational Wave of Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. In this work, a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm is applied to the MBHB signals. It is demonstrated that the quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results indicate that the quantum-enhanced approach significantly reduces computational costs. However, it is also found that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. This highlights the need for more robust and stable quantum search strategies.</description>

Abstract: Sine dilaton gravity is holographically related to DSSYK. We explain how to interpret sine dilaton as 2d quantum cosmology. This paves the way for using two copies of DSSYK as hologram for Big-Bang cosmologies. We study the most basic cosmological observable: the sphere amplitude. Via canonical quantization we find a finite answer that matches the on-shell action of a dual matrix integral. The sphere amplitude (or the norm of the no-boundary wavefunction) also gives a prediction for the universe's size. In the context of slow-roll inflation, the no-boundary state is non-normalizable, and predicts a small universe, in contradiction with experiments. We argue that an avatar of these issues exists in dS JT gravity. By considering sine dilaton as a UV completion of dS JT gravity, the state becomes normalizable. We then consider the observer's no-boundary state and show that this prefers neither small nor large universes. The resulting distribution is flat.</description>

      <title>The Quintom theory of dark energy after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by suggesting that the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy evolves across $w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. Inspired by this development, we present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications as well as possible extensions. We first trace the historical progression from Einstein's static cosmological constant to modern dynamical dark energy, summarizing recent cosmological constraints that favor an evolving $w(z)$ along time. A key focus is the theoretical no-go theorem for dark energy showing that no single canonical field or perfect fluid model can smoothly cross the $w = -1$ boundary. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintom fields with ordinary matter and the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>What solves the Hubble tension in phenomenological dark energy models at background level?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few phenomenological models tend to favour higher values of the Hubble parameter, often at the expense of invoking phantom transitions. These models achieve this without introducing additional parameters, akin to the simplicity of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate two such models -- Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) and Granda-Oliveros Holographic Dark Energy (GOHDE) -- to assess how correlations between $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$, as well as the choice of datasets, influence conclusions regarding their potential to address the Hubble tension at the background level. We find that minimally extended versions of these models favour notably low values for the Hubble parameter, with the perceived preference for higher values driven by the associated prior. Excluding BAO Ly$\alpha$-$H(z)$ data points at a redshift of $\sim 2.3$ results in a Hubble parameter that remains in significant tension with SH0ES measurements. In contrast, including these data points favours a higher $H_0$, as they suggest a relatively lower matter density within the framework of the assumed fiducial cosmology. Additionally, recent DESI DR1 and DR2 data exhibit mild tension with BAO-$H(z)$ estimates from SDSS. We demonstrate that the inclusion of stringent constraints, such as the CMB shift-parameter along with Pantheon$^+$, on the effective pressure less matter density significantly impacts the estimation of the Hubble parameter. Finally, reinterpreting these models in terms of interacting dark sectors with $Q = 3H\gamma_{\Lambda}\tilde{\rho}_{m}$ reveals that addressing the Hubble tension necessitates a varying $\gamma_{\Lambda}$ characterised by a singular sign-switch behaviour. This phantom behaviour, or equivalently, the onset of violation of the null energy condition in the future, is crucial for minimal models to solve the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The effects of the spin and quadrupole moment of SgrA* on the orbits of S stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the astrometric and spectroscopic data of stars orbiting the central black hole in our galaxy (Sgr A*) offers a promising way to measure relativistic effects. In principle, the "no-hair" theorem can be tested at the Galactic Center by monitoring the orbital precession of S-stars due to the angular momentum (spin) and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*. Closer-in stars, more strongly affected by the black hole's rotation, may be required. GRAVITY+ could detect such stars that are currently too faint for GRAVITY. We aim to analytically and numerically characterize orbital reorientations induced by spin-related effects of Sgr A* up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order. We use the two-timescale method to derive the 2PN analytical expressions of the secular evolution of the orbital parameters that are related to the observer. To study the interaction between the orbital and spin orientations, we introduce observer-independent quantities that offer insight into the Kerr geometry. We also use the post-Newtonian code OOGRE to simulate hypothetical stars orbiting closer to Sgr A*, where spin and quadrupole effects are stronger. This enables comparison with our analytical predictions. We exhibit three orbital-timescale precession rates that encode the in-plane pericenter shift and the out-of-plane redirection of the osculating ellipse. We provide the 2PN expressions of these precession rates and express the orbit-integrated associated angular shifts of the pericenter and of the ellipse axes. We relate these orbital-timescale precession rates to the secular-timescale precession of the orbital angular momentum around the black hole spin axis. We consider that the theoretical insight we provide in this article will be useful in constraining the spin effect of Sgr A* with GRAVITY+ observations.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of dark energy during the matter-dominated era through spontaneous cosmological scalarization
  in the scalar-Ricci-Gauss-Bonnet model.Our model aligns with the conjecture that the speed of gravitational waves at low
  redshifts is nearly equal to the speed of light, implying that the Gauss-Bonnet invariant does not directly contribute to late-time
  acceleration and suggesting that scalarization begins in the radiation-dominated era. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling stabilizes the quintessence
  field at an initial fixed point with negligible dark energy density during the radiation era. As the Universe expands, the Ricci coupling induces a tachyonic transition in the quintessence field, driving the evolution of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dark matter: Covariant Brownian motion from Planckian discreteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity has long remained elusive from an observational standpoint. Developing effective cosmological models motivated by the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity is crucial for bridging theory with observations. One key aspect is the granularity of spacetime, which suggests that free particles would deviate from classical geodesics by following a covariant Brownian motion. This notion is further supported by swerves models in causal set theory, a discrete approach to quantum gravity. At an effective level, such deviations are described by a stochastic correction to the geodesic equation. We show that the form of this correction is strictly restricted by covariance and the mass-shell condition. Under minimal coupling to curvature, the resulting covariant Brownian motion is unique. The process is equivalently described by a covariant diffusion equation for the distribution of massive particles in their relativistic phase space. When applied to dark matter particles, covariant Brownian motion results in spontaneous warming at late times, suppressing the matter power spectrum at small scales in a time-dependent manner. Using bounds on the diffusion rate from CMB and growth history measurements of $f\sigma_8$, we show that the model offers a resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Future studies on the model's behavior at non-linear cosmological scales will provide further constraints and, therefore, critical tests for the viability of stochastic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravity -- Fundamental Aspects of Metric Theories and their Implications for Tests of General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guided by the Einstein equivalence principle that identifies the phenomenon of gravitation as a manifestation of the dynamics of spacetime in contrast to a localizable force, we review and explore its consequences on formulating a theory of gravity. The resulting space of metric theories of gravity may address open conceptual and observational puzzles through a wealth of effects beyond general relativity, whose traces can be searched for within today's and tomorrow's gravitational testing grounds. Above all, we offer a generic metric theory generalization of Isaacson's approach to the leading-order field equations of physical perturbations with a well-defined notion of energy-momentum carried by the gravitational waves. Within this framework, we identify the backreaction of the Isaacson energy-momentum flux onto the background spacetime with the displacement memory effect that induces a permanent distortion of space after the passage of a gravitational wave. This effect is a well-known prediction of GR whose dominant contribution captures its inherent non-linear nature, manifest in the ability of gravity to gravitate. However, the novel interpretation of memory as naturally arising within the Isaacson approach to gravitational waves comes with two main advantages. Firstly, it allows for a unified understanding of both the null and the ordinary memory effect, which are respectively sourced by unbound energy fluxes that do and do not reach asymptotic null infinity. Secondly, and most importantly, this approach allows for a consistent derivation of the memory formula for a large class of metric theories with considerable lessons to be learned for upcoming future measurements of the memory effect.</description>

      <title>Strong deflection of massive particles in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16712v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near a gravitating compact object, massive particles traveling along timelike geodesics are gravitationally deflected similarly to light. In this paper, we study the deflection angles of these particles in the strong deflection limit. This analytical approximation applies when particles in unbound orbits approach the compact object very closely, circle around it at a radius close to that of the unstable circular orbit, and eventually escape. While previous studies have provided results for particular metrics, we offer a general solution applicable to any static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime. After briefly reviewing the exact expression for the deflection angle of massive particles, we present a strong deflection limit analysis for this general case. The developed formulas are then applied to three particular metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Janis-Newman-Winicour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the cosmic expansion scenarios in the $f(R, L_m)$ gravity studied by using the dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameters. We proceed with the specific form of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity termed as $f(R, L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_{m}^{\alpha}$. We derive the expansion rate in terms of the red-shift for two different forms of EoS parameter. In first model, EoS parameter varies inversely with the redshift and in second model, it involves the exponential form with the redshift. By using the Bayesian methods based on the $\chi^{2}$-minimization technique, the median values of model parameters are determined for the cosmic chronometer(CC) and Joint (CC+Pantheon) data sets. The behavior of fundamental cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, energy density and pressure are thoroughly examined. Additionally, the nature of Statefinder diagnostics and the present age of universe exemplifies the compatibility with the late-time astronomical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates warm inflation within the context of $f(Q)$ gravity for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We formulate the governing field equations using slow-roll approximations and examine a power-law model to evaluate critical inflationary parameters including slow-roll parameters, scalar and tensor power spectra, and their associated spectral indices. The distinguishing feature of warm inflation lies in its fundamental premise that both radiation and inflaton coexist and interact throughout the inflationary phase. This interaction facilitates energy transfer from the inflaton to radiation through a dissipative process, maintaining the universe's thermal state. In our approach, we innovatively employ $f(Q)$ dark energy as the driving mechanism for warm inflation, exploring its dynamics in a highly dissipative regime through two distinct toy models. Our analysis reveals that $f(Q)$ dark energy can effectively drive warm inflation in the early universe, with both models satisfying essential conditions: the dominance of $f(Q)$ energy density over radiation density and the prevalence of thermal fluctuations over quantum fluctuations ($T &gt; H$). The numerical results demonstrate that as inflation progresses, energy transfers from the $f(Q)$ sector to radiation, eventually bringing both densities to comparable levels near the end of inflation. Importantly, our computed values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) and scalar spectral index ($n_s$) align well with current observational constraints, validating the viability of warm inflation in $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

Abstract: Light, though massless, does not travel in a perfectly straight line when it passes near a massive object. Instead, it follows the curvature of spacetime - a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, occurs because massive bodies like stars, galaxies, or black holes distort the fabric of spacetime around them, bending the path of light much like a lens bends rays in optics. In this work, we study gravitational lensing using the gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] based on four one-dimensional unitary gauge symmetries and formulated as a quantum field theory in the Minkowski spacetime extending the Standard Model to include gravity. The dynamical equation of light in unified gravity contains explicit coupling to the gravity gauge field whereas, in general relativity, gravitational coupling is entirely described through the metric. Despite this fundamental difference, unified gravity can be used to calculate observable effects of gravity, such as the deflection of light near astrophysical objects. Without a single free parameter, perfect agreement between unified gravity and general relativity is obtained for the deflection angle of light in the first power of the gravitational constant. However, the second-order contribution to the deflection angle reveals a measurable relative difference of $1/15\approx6.7\%$ between the predictions of unified gravity and general relativity. Therefore, detailed observations of gravitational lensing or gravitational wave data are expected to enable experimentally differentiating between the two theories in the near future, thus revealing the profound symmetry principles of the Universe.</description>

      <title>On the Identification of Exotic Compact Binaries with Gravitational Waves: a Phenomenological approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has been hailed as a gateway to discovering unexpected phenomena in the universe. Over the last decade there have been close to one hundred GW observations of compact-binary mergers. While these signals are largely consistent with mergers of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, or black hole-neutron star systems, some events suggest the intriguing possibility of binaries involving exotic compact objects (ECOs). Identifying and characterising an ECO merger would require accurate ECO waveform models. Using large numbers of numerical relativity simulations to develop customised models for ECO mergers akin to those used for binary black holes, would be not only computationally expensive but also challenging due to the limited understanding of the underlying physics. Alternatively, key physical imprints of the ECO on the inspiral or merger could in principle be incorporated phenomenologically into waveform models, sufficient to quantify generic properties. In this work we present a first application of this idea to assess the detectability and distinguishability of ECO mergers, and we propose a phenomenological approach that can iteratively incorporate features of ECO mergers, laying the groundwork for an effective exotic compact object identifier in compact binary coalescences. We demonstrate that within this framework the compactness of the objects in GW150914 are consistent with that of black holes. The efficacy of the identifier can be refined by adding information from numerical relativity simulations involving fundamental fields. Conversely, such an identifier framework can help focus future numerical relativity and modeling efforts for exotic objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.10819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If our universe was born as a baby universe on the other side of the event horizon of a black hole existing in a parent universe, then the corresponding white hole at rest provides the absolute frame of reference in the universe. In this frame, the cosmic microwave background radiation is isotropic on large scales. If the parent black hole is rotating, then its axis of rotation becomes a preferred axis in the universe. Accordingly, the absolute frame is non-inertial, although the non-inertial forces are small. To decrease their energies, galaxies tend to align their axes of rotation with the preferred axis, resulting in clockwise-counterclockwise asymmetry. The centrifugal force causes a large-scale bulk flow of galaxy clusters in directions perpendicular to the preferred axis. The astronomical data seem to support these motions. The angular velocity of the universe decreases as the universe expands, which is a consequence of the conservation of the angular momentum of the universe. The centrifugal force in a rotating universe, which also decreases, may be the origin of dark energy, in accordance with recent DES observations showing that dark energy becomes weaker with time.</description>

In $2$d CDT, one can deal with the quantum effects analytically and explore the physics through the continuum limit. The continuum theory is known to be two-dimensional projectable Horava-Lifshitz quantum gravity ($2$d projectable HL QG). In this chapter, we wish to review the very relation between $2$d CDT and $2$d projectable HL QG in detail.</description>

      <title>Do high redshift QSOs and GRBs corroborate JWST?</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the $\Lambda$CDM perspective. Interpreted as a cosmological problem, this necessitates the Planck collaboration underestimating either matter density $\Omega_m$ or physical matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ and remains anomalously large at higher redshifts. We relax the traditional priors by allowing for $\Omega_m &gt; 1$, consistent with negative dark energy density, to locate profile likelihood peaks where possible. While the variation of $\Omega_m$ with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in $\chi^2$ in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to $3.9 \sigma$ and $7.9 \sigma$ tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions. Finally, in the large sample limit, we show that Feldman-Cousins prescription for frequentist confidence intervals in the presence of a boundary (prior) leads to confidence intervals that are bounded above by Wilks' theorem.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum theory on curved space-time with quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies present new opportunities for fundamental tests of nature. One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity - a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atom-like systems can be used to probe time-dilation induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are non-local measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on km-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved space-time, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Minimal Areas from Entangled Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a relational notion of a subsystem in theories of matrix quantum mechanics and show how the corresponding entanglement entropy can be given as a minimisation, exhibiting many similarities to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Our construction brings together the physics of entanglement edge modes, noncommutative geometry and quantum internal reference frames, to define a subsystem whose reduced state is (approximately) an incoherent sum of density matrices, corresponding to distinct spatial subregions. We show that in states where geometry emerges from semiclassical matrices, this sum is dominated by the subregion with minimal boundary area. As in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, it is the computation of the entanglement that determines the subregion. We find that coarse-graining is essential in our microscopic derivation, in order to control the proliferation of highly curved and disconnected non-geometric subregions in the sum.</description>

      <title>Test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity: extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key observational targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Unresolvable EMRI signals contribute to the formation of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Characterizing the statistical features of the GWB from EMRIs is of great importance, as EMRIs will ubiquitously affect large segments of the inference scheme. In this work, we apply a frequentist test for GWB Gaussianity and stationarity, exploring three astrophysically-motivated EMRI populations. We construct the resulting signal by combining state-of-the-art EMRI waveforms and a detailed description of the LISA response with time-delay interferometric variables.Depending on the brightness of the GWB, our analysis demonstrates that the resultant EMRI foregrounds show varying degrees of departure from the usual statistical assumptions that the GWBs are both Gaussian and Stationary. If the GWB is non-stationary with non-Gaussian features, this will challenge the robustness of Gaussian-likelihood model, when applied to global inference results, e.g. foreground estimation, background detection, and individual-source parameters reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects and Bubble Wall Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as a quantum frictional effect on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe. Consequently, this study validates the consistency of our method for constructing meaningful physical quantities in quantum inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

      <title>Properties of the wormhole-dominant phase in two-dimensional quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $N \times N$ Hermitian one-matrix model modified by the double-trace interaction. It is known that the coupling for the double-trace interaction can control the weight for the microscopic wormholes if interpreting the matrix model as the lattice model of random surface; tuning the coupling to its critical value, the effect of wormholes become substantial to change the critical behavior of the pure $2$D quantum gravity, which is characterized by a certain positive value of the string susceptibility. In the large-$N$ limit, we calculate the continuum limit of the disk amplitude in which the wormhole effects are important. The resulting continuum disk amplitude is the same as that of the pure $2$D quantum gravity. We also introduce the renormalized coupling for the double-trace interaction, and show that the newly introduced renormalized coupling can alter the renormalized bulk cosmological constant effectively.</description>

      <title>On the Gauge Invariance of Secondary Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second-order tensor perturbations induced by primordial fluctuations play a crucial role in probing small-scale physics, but gauge dependence of their energy density has remained a fundamental challenge in cosmological perturbation theory. We address this issue by introducing a boundary condition-based filtering method that extracts physical radiation through the Sommerfeld criterion. We demonstrate that after filtering non-physical modes, the energy density of secondary gravitational waves becomes gauge-invariant and exhibits physically consistent behavior in the sub-horizon limit. This approach provides a unified framework for both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations, enhancing theoretical predictions and observational signatures of early universe physics.</description>

      <title>Prompt Periodicity in the GRB 211211A Precursor: Black-hole or magnetar engine?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merger origin long GRB 211211A was a class (re-)defining event. A precursor was identified with a $\sim 1$ s separation from the main burst, as well as a claimed candidate quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a frequency $\sim20$ Hz. Here, we explore the implications of the precursor, assuming the quasi-periodicity is real. The precursor variability timescale requires relativistic motion with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma\gtrsim80$, and implies an engine driven jetted outflow. The declining amplitude of the consecutive pulses requires an episodic engine with an `on/off' cycle consistent with the QPO. For a black-hole central engine, the QPO can have its origin in Lense-Thirring precession of the inner disk at $\sim6-9$ $r_g$ (gravitational radii) for a mass $M_\bullet\leq4.5$ $M_{\odot}$, and $\lesssim 7$ $r_g$ for $M_\bullet&gt;4.5$ $M_{\odot}$ and dimensionless spin $\chi\sim 0.3 - 0.9$. Alternatively, at a disk density of $\sim10^{8 - 12}$ g cm$^{-3}$, the required magnetic field strength for a QPO via magnetohydrodynamic effects will be on the order $B\sim10^{12 - 14}$ G. If the central engine is a short lived magnetar or hypermassive neutron star, then a low-frequency QPO can be produced via instabilities within the disk at a radius of $\sim20 - 70$ km, for a disk density $\sim10^{9 - 12}$ g cm$^{-3}$ and magnetic field $\gtrsim10^{13 - 14}$ G. The QPO cannot be coupled to the neutron star spin, as the co-rotation radius is beyond the scale of the disk. Neither engine can be ruled out -- however, we favour an origin for the precursor candidate QPO as early jet-disk coupling for a neutron star -- black hole merger remnant with mass $M_\bullet&gt;4.5$ $M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Large amplitude mechanical coherent states and detection of weak nonlinearities in cavity optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of large-amplitude coherent states of a massive mechanical resonator, and their quantum-limited detection represent useful tools for quantum sensing and for testing fundamental physics theories. In fact, any weak perturbation may affect the coherent quantum evolution of the prepared state, providing a sensitive probe for such a perturbation. Here we consider a cavity optomechanical setup and the case of the detection of a weak mechanical nonlinearity. We consider different strategies, first focusing on the stationary dynamics in the presence of multiple tones driving the system, and then focusing on non-equilibrium dynamical strategies. These methods can be successfully applied for measuring Duffing-like material nonlinearities, or effective nonlinear corrections associated with quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>A new framework for classical double copies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The double copy relates gauge and gravitational theories, with widespread application to quantum scattering amplitudes and classical perturbative results. It also connects exact classical solutions of abelian gauge and gravitational theories in a small number of specific examples, known as classical double copies. These have a number of special properties, such as being algebraically special, and it remains an open question examples exist for algebraically general spacetimes or with nontrivial dynamics. Here we provide a novel framework for understanding classical double copies at the level of the metric, both organizing the known examples and exploring their properties under a new lens. Utilizing Killing vectors as natural gauge fields on a spacetime, we propose a procedure for generating new classical double copies. As a proof of concept, we provide a flat space single copy for the Kasner metric, an algebraically general spacetime. This example is also a double copy at the level of its curvature, and provides the first type I Weyl double copy on flat spacetime, confirming expectations from perturbation theory. This provides a promising avenue for extending exact double copies to a broader class of general, physically relevant spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles: Connections and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. Alongside other results, we show that once an $\mathbb{R}^\times$-connection has been chosen, there is a canonical affine connection that is torsionless, but, in general, not compatible with the degenerate metric. The construction of an affine connection is intimately tied to a Kaluza-Klein geometry.</description>
