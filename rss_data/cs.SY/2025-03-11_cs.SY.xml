      <title>Real-Time Line Parameter Estimation Method for Multi-Phase Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate distribution network model is crucial for monitoring, state estimation and energy management. However, existing data-driven methods often struggle with scalability or impose a heavy computational burden on large distribution networks. In this paper, leveraging natural load dynamics, we propose a two-stage line estimation method for multiphase unbalanced distribution networks. Simulation results using real-life load and PV data show that the proposed method reduces computational time by one to two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Co-Optimizing Distributed Energy Resources under Demand Charges and Bi-Directional Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the co-optimization of behind-the-meter (BTM) distributed energy resources (DER), including flexible demands, renewable distributed generation (DG), and battery energy storage systems (BESS) under net energy metering (NEM) frameworks with demand charges. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program that accounts for renewable generation uncertainty and operational surplus maximization. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the optimal policy follows a threshold structure. Finally, we show that even a simple algorithm leveraging this threshold structure performs well in simulation, emphasizing its importance in developing near-optimal algorithms. These findings provide crucial insights for implementing prosumer energy management systems under complex tariff structures.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control with Rate-Limited Integral Action for Systems with Matched, Time-Varying Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of controlling a piecewise continuously differentiable system subject to time-varying uncertainties. The uncertainties are decomposed into a time-invariant, linearly-parameterized portion and a time-varying unstructured portion. The former is addressed using conventional model reference adaptive control. The latter is handled using disturbance observer-based control. The objective is to ensure good performance through observer-based disturbance rejection when possible, while preserving the robustness guarantees of adaptive control. A key feature of the observer-based disturbance compensation is a magnitude and rate limit on the integral action that prevents fast fluctuations in the control command due to the observer dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Integration of Grid Edge Resources into Wholesale Electricity Markets via Mean-field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid edge resources refer to distributed energy resources (DERs) located on the consumer side of the electrical grid, controlled by consumers rather than utility companies. Integrating DERs with real-time electricity pricing can better align distributed supply with system demand, improving grid efficiency and reliability. However, DER owners, known as prosumers, often lack the expertise and resources to directly participate in wholesale energy markets, limiting their ability to fully realize the economic potential of their assets. Meanwhile, as DER adoption grows, the number of prosumers participating in the energy system is expected to increase significantly, creating additional challenges in coordination and market participation.
  To address these challenges, we propose a mean-field game framework that enables prosumers to autonomously learn optimal decision policies based on dynamic market prices and their variable solar generation. Our framework is designed to accommodate heterogeneous agents and demonstrates the existence of a mean-field equilibrium (MFE) in a wholesale energy market with many prosumers. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm that automates prosumers' resource control, facilitating real-time decision-making for energy storage management. Numerical experiments suggest that our approach converges towards an MFE and effectively reduces peak loads and price volatility, especially during periods of external demand or supply shocks. This study highlights the potential of a fully decentralized approach to integrating DERs into wholesale markets while improving market efficiency.</description>

      <title>Joint Semantic Transmission and Resource Allocation for Intelligent Computation Task Offloading in MEC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables the provision of high-reliability and low-latency applications by offering computation and storage resources in close proximity to end-users. Different from traditional computation task offloading in MEC systems, the large data volume and complex task computation of artificial intelligence involved intelligent computation task offloading have increased greatly. To address this challenge, we propose a MEC system for multiple base stations and multiple terminals, which exploits semantic transmission and early exit of inference. Based on this, we investigate a joint semantic transmission and resource allocation problem for maximizing system reward combined with analysis of semantic transmission and intelligent computation process. To solve the formulated problem, we decompose it into communication resource allocation subproblem, semantic transmission subproblem, and computation capacity allocation subproblem. Then, we use 3D matching and convex optimization method to solve subproblems based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework. The optimized feasible solutions are derived from an efficient BCD based joint semantic transmission and resource allocation algorithm in MEC systems. Our simulation demonstrates that: 1) The proposed algorithm significantly improves the delay performance for MEC systems compared with benchmarks; 2) The design of transmission mode and early exit of inference greatly increases system reward during offloading; and 3) Our proposed system achieves efficient utilization of resources from the perspective of system reward in the intelligent scenario.</description>

      <title>Integrated Energy Management for Operational Cost Optimization in Community Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an integrated energy management strategy for cost optimization in multi-energy community microgrids (MGs). The proposed approach combines storage-based peak shaving, economic dispatch of diesel generators, and efficient utilization of renewable energy sources to enhance energy management in community MGs. The efficacy of the energy management system (EMS) was validated through a simulation case study for a rural Australian community. The results demonstrate that the proposed EMS effectively reduces the peak energy demand by up to 43%, lowers operational costs by 84.63% (from $189,939/year to $29,188/year), and achieves a renewable energy utilization of 92.3%, up from 47.8% in the base system. Furthermore, the levelized cost of energy was reduced by 14.21% to $0.163/kWh. The strategy ensures an uninterrupted power supply during grid outages by utilizing DGs and battery energy storage systems. The environmental benefits included a 196.4% reduction in CO2 emissions and 100% reductions in CO, unburned hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. These findings validate the feasibility of the proposed EMS in achieving cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable energy management in community MGs. These findings contribute to the field by introducing a novel approach and demonstrating the practical feasibility of multi-energy MGs.</description>

      <title>A Three-Dimensional Pursuit-Evasion Game Based on Fuzzy Actor-Critic Learning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the existing research on pursuit-evasion game (PEG) is conducted in a two-dimensional (2D) environment. In this paper, we investigate the PEG in a 3D space. We extend the Apollonius circle (AC) to the 3D space and introduce its detailed analytical form. To enhance the capture efficiency, we derive the optimal motion space for both the pursuer and the evader. To address the issue arising from a discrete state space, we design a fuzzy actor-critic learning (FACL) algorithm to obtain the agents' strategies. To improve learning performance, we devise a reward function for the agents, which enables obstacle avoidance functionality. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Dynamic Controller Synthesis for Discrete-Time General Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing safety controllers for general nonlinear systems is a highly challenging task, particularly when the system models are unknown, and input constraints are present. While some recent efforts have explored data-driven safety controller design for nonlinear systems, these approaches are primarily limited to specific classes of nonlinear dynamics (e.g., polynomials) and are not applicable to general nonlinear systems. This paper develops a direct data-driven approach for discrete-time general nonlinear systems, facilitating the simultaneous learning of control barrier certificates (CBCs) and dynamic controllers to ensure safety properties under input constraints. Specifically, by leveraging the adding-one-integrator approach, we incorporate the controller's dynamics into the system dynamics to synthesize a virtual static-feedback controller for the augmented system, resulting in a dynamic safety controller for the actual dynamics. We collect input-state data from the augmented system during a finite-time experiment, referred to as a single trajectory. Using this data, we learn augmented CBCs and the corresponding virtual safety controllers, ensuring the safety of the actual system and adherence to input constraints over a finite time horizon. We demonstrate that our proposed conditions boil down to some data-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are easy to satisfy. We showcase the effectiveness of our data-driven approach through two case studies: one exhibiting significant nonlinearity and the other featuring high dimensionality.</description>

      <title>From Data to Global Asymptotic Stability of Unknown Large-Scale Networks with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a compositional data-driven scheme for synthesizing controllers that ensure global asymptotic stability (GAS) across large-scale interconnected networks, characterized by unknown mathematical models. In light of each network's configuration composed of numerous subsystems with smaller dimensions, our proposed framework gathers data from each subsystem's trajectory, enabling the design of local controllers that ensure input-to-state stability (ISS) properties over subsystems, signified by ISS Lyapunov functions. To accomplish this, we require only a single input-state trajectory from each unknown subsystem up to a specified time horizon, fulfilling certain rank conditions. Subsequently, under small-gain compositional reasoning, we leverage ISS Lyapunov functions derived from data to offer a control Lyapunov function (CLF) for the interconnected network, ensuring GAS certificate over the network. We demonstrate that while the computational complexity for designing a CLF increases polynomially with the network dimension using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization, our compositional data-driven approach significantly mitigates it to \emph{linear} with respect to the number of subsystems. We showcase the efficacy of our data-driven approach over a set of benchmarks, involving physical networks with diverse interconnection topologies.</description>

      <title>Electrifying Heavy-Duty Trucks: Battery-Swapping vs Fast Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advantages and disadvantages of Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) for heavy-duty trucks are poorly understood, relative to Fast Charging Stations (FCS) systems. This study evaluates these two charging mechanisms for electric heavy-duty trucks, aiming to compare the systems' efficiency and identify the optimal design for each option. A model was developed to address the planning and operation of BSS in a charging network, considering in-station batteries as assets for various services. We assess performance metrics including transportation efficiency and battery utilization efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that BSS significantly increased transportation efficiency by reducing vehicle downtime compared to fast charging, but may require more batteries. BSS with medium-sized batteries offers improved transportation efficiency in terms of time and labor. FCS-reliant trucks require larger batteries to compensate for extended charging times. To understand the trade-off between these two metrics, a cost-benefit analysis was performed under different scenarios involving potential shifts in battery prices and labor costs. Additionally, BSS shows potential for significant $\text{CO}_2$ emission reductions and increased profitability through energy arbitrage and grid ancillary services. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating BSS into future electric truck charging networks and adopting carbon-aware operational frameworks.</description>

      <title>TRUST: Stability and Safety Controller Synthesis for Unknown Dynamical Models Using a Single Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TRUST is an open-source software tool developed for data-driven controller synthesis of dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models, ensuring either stability or safety properties. By collecting only a single input-state trajectory from the unknown system and satisfying a rank condition that ensures the system is persistently excited according to the Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma, TRUST aims to design either control Lyapunov functions (CLF) or control barrier certificates (CBC), along with their corresponding stability or safety controllers. The tool implements sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs solely based on data to enforce stability or safety properties across four system classes: (i) continuous-time nonlinear polynomial systems, (ii) continuous-time linear systems, (iii) discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems, and (iv) discrete-time linear systems. TRUST is a Python-based web application featuring an intuitive, reactive graphic user interface (GUI) built with web technologies. It can be accessed at https://trust.tgo.dev or installed locally, and supports both manual data entry and data file uploads. Leveraging the power of the Python backend and a JavaScript frontend, TRUST is designed to be highly user-friendly and accessible across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices. We apply TRUST to a set of physical benchmarks with unknown dynamics, ensuring either stability or safety properties across the four supported classes of models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vehicle Platooning Safety via Control Node Placement and Sizing under State and Input Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle platooning with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control improves traffic efficiency, reduces energy consumption, and enhances safety but remains vulnerable to cyber-attacks that disrupt communication and cause unsafe actions. To address these risks, this paper investigates control node placement and input bound optimization to balance safety and defense efficiency under various conditions. We propose a two-stage actuator placement and actuator saturation approach, which focuses on identifying key actuators that maximize the system's controllability while operating under state and input constraints. By strategically placing and limiting the input bounds of critical actuators, we ensure that vehicles maintain safe distances even under attack. Simulation results show that our method effectively mitigates the impact of attacks while preserving defense efficiency, offering a robust solution to vehicle platooning safety challenges.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions for Prescribed-time Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks using Spatiotemporal Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prescribed-time reach-avoid-stay (PT-RAS) specifications are crucial in applications requiring precise timing, state constraints, and safety guarantees. While control carrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as a promising approach, providing formal guarantees of safety, constructing CBFs that satisfy PT-RAS specifications remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel approach using a spatiotemporal tubes (STTs) framework to construct CBFs for PT-RAS tasks. The STT framework allows for the systematic design of CBFs that dynamically manage both spatial and temporal constraints, ensuring the system remains within a safe operational envelope while achieving the desired temporal objectives. The proposed method is validated with two case studies: temporal motion planning of an omnidirectional robot and temporal waypoint navigation of a drone with obstacles, using higher-order CBFs.</description>

      <title>Forecast-Driven Scenario Generation for Building Energy Management Using Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buildings are essential components of power grids, and their energy performance directly affects overall power system operation. This paper presents a novel stochastic optimization framework for building energy management systems, aiming to enhance buildings' energy performance and facilitate their effective integration into emerging intelligent power grids. In this method, solar power generation and building electricity demand forecasts are combined with historical data, leveraging statistical characteristics to generate probability matrices and corresponding scenarios with associated probabilities. These scenarios are then used to solve the stochastic optimization problem, optimizing building energy flow while accounting for existing uncertainties. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively manages inherent uncertainties while maintaining performance and outperforming rule-based and custom build reinforcement learning based solutions.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Path Following of UAVs using Event-Triggered Communication over Networks with Digraph Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel time-coordination algorithm based on event-triggered communication to ensure multiple UAVs progress along their desired paths in coordination with one another. In the proposed algorithm, a UAV transmits its progression information to its neighbor UAVs only when a decentralized trigger condition is satisfied. Consequently, it significantly reduces the volume of inter-vehicle communications required to achieve the goal compared with the existing algorithms based on continuous communication. With such intermittent communications, it is shown that a decentralized coordination controller guarantees exponential convergence of the coordination error to a neighborhood of zero. Furthermore, a lower bound on the difference between two consecutive event-triggered times is provided showing that the Zeno behavior is excluded with the proposed algorithm. Lastly, simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low Power AMOLED Displays for Smart Wearable Applications: Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous advancement and maturity of AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode) technology, smart wearable products such as watches and bracelets are increasingly incorporating related technologies as display screen implementation solutions. Using standby time is the most critical product performance measurement indicator at the moment, according to the power supply system design of smart wearable products and customer usage habits. AMOLED displays, as one of the major power-consuming components in smart wearable products, are also subject to extremely stringent power consumption requirements. This paper divides an AMOLED display into five parts: the power chip, the driver chip, the array substrate, the light-emitting structure, and the light-transmitting structure. In this paper, we propose targeted power-saving solutions for each component based on their respective operating principles, subject areas, and the most recent advances in related fields, and we provide the best overall solution by combining the interactions between each component and even the entire system. The relevant solutions have been validated in practice, and there is clear verification data to demonstrate their feasibility.</description>

      <title>Construction and Control of Validated Highly Configurable Multi-Physics Building Models for Multi-Energy System Analysis in a Co-Simulation Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving energy efficiency by monitoring system behavior and predicting future energy scenarios in light of increased penetration of renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important, especially for energy systems that distribute and provide heat. On this background, digital twins of cities become paramount in advancing urban energy system planning and infrastructure management. The use of recorded energy data from sensors in district digital twins in collaborative co-simulation platforms is a promising way to analyze detailed system behavior and estimate future scenarios. However, the development and coupling of multi-physics energy system models need to be validated before they can be used for further in-depth analyses. In the present paper, a new multi-physics/-modal and highly configurable building model is presented. Its accuracy and reliability are validated by comparison with data from the TABULA project, ensuring its relevance and applicability to real-world scenarios. The modularity and flexibility with regard to the system configurability of the developed building model is evaluated on various real building types. In addition, the applicability of the building model in a multi-energy system is highlighted by implementing the model in a collaborative co-simulation setup and by coupling it to a district heating grid model in yearly co-simulations. The simulation results for the proposed multi-physical/-modal building modeling concept show a very high level of agreement compared to published reference building data and can therefore be used individually as flexible and modular building models including both thermal and electrical systems for future sector-coupled energy system analyses in view of sustainability.</description>

      <title>New Co-Simulation Variants for Emissions and Cost Reduction of Sustainable District Heating Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical heating of residential areas is very energy-intensive, so alternatives are needed, including renewable energies and advanced heating technologies. Thus, the present paper introduces a new methodology for comprehensive variant analysis for future district heating planning, aiming at optimizing emissions and costs. For this, an extensive Modelica-based modeling study comprising models of heating center, heat grid pipelines and heating interface units to buildings are coupled in co-simulations. These enable a comparative analysis of the economic feasibility and sustainability for various technologies and energy carriers to be carried out. The new modular and highly parameterizable building model serves for validation of the introduced heat grid model. The results show that bio-methane as an energy source reduces carbon equivalent emissions by nearly 70% compared to conventional natural gas heating, and the use of hydrogen as an energy source reduces carbon equivalent emissions by 77% when equipped with a heat pump. In addition, the use of ground source heat pumps has a high economic viability when economic benefits are taken into account. The study findings highlight the importance of strategic planning and flexible design in the early stages of district development in order to achieve improved energy efficiency and a reduced carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Generation and Balancing Capacity in Future Electric Power Systems -- Scenario Analysis Using Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of the Finnish electric energy system up to 2035, focusing on the likelihood of different development paths. The primary contribution of this paper is the development of an extensive Bayesian Network, designed to model and analyse the evolution of power generation capacity mix, assess the likelihood of different grid management scenarios, and understand the causal relationships underlying these scenarios. A target optimisation was carried out using the constructed Bayesian Network to explore possibilities to minimise grid management complexity. The results of the optimisation reveal that the authorities and stakeholders should prioritise increasing demand response, gas power, and battery storage capacities. These mature technologies are well-suited to guarantee energy adequacy during peak consumption periods, which in Finland typically occur during consecutive cold, dark and windless winter weeks. Although this study focuses on the evolution of the Finnish power grid, the constructed Bayesian Network approach is broadly applicable and can be utilised to explore causal relationships in other countries by employing the designed questionnaire and engaging a panel of experts specific to the country's energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Geometric Nonlinear Filtering with Almost Global Convergence for Attitude and Bias Estimation on the Special Orthogonal Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric nonlinear filter for attitude and bias estimation on the Special Orthogonal Group $SO(3)$ using matrix measurements. The structure of the proposed filter is similar to that of the continuous-time deterministic multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF). The main difference with the MEKF is the inclusion of curvature correction terms in both the filter gain and gain update equations. These terms ensure that the proposed filter, named the Generalized $SO(3)$-MEKF, renders the desired equilibrium of the estimation error system to be almost globally uniformly asymptotically stable (AGUAS). More precisely, the attitude and bias estimation errors converge uniformly asymptotically to zero for almost all initial conditions except those where the initial angular estimation error equals $\pi$ radians. Moreover, in the case of small estimation errors, the proposed generalized $SO(3)$-MEKF simplifies to the standard $SO(3)$-MEKF with matrix measurements. Simulation results indicate that the proposed filter has similar performance compared to the latter. Thus, the main advantage of the proposed filter over the MEKF is the guarantee of (almost) global uniform asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tubes based Controller Synthesis against Omega-Regular Specifications for Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a discretization-free solution to the synthesis of approx-imation-free closed-form controllers for unknown nonlinear systems to enforce complex properties expressed by $\omega$-regular languages, as recognized by Non-deterministic B\"uchi Automata (NBA). In order to solve this problem, we first decompose NBA into a sequence of reach-avoid problems, which are solved using the Spatiotemporal Tubes (STT) approach. Controllers for each reach-avoid task are then integrated into a hybrid policy that ensures the fulfillment of the desired $\omega$-regular properties. We validate our method through omnidirectional robot navigation and manipulator control case studies.</description>

      <title>Input Delay Compensation for a Class of Switched Linear Systems via Averaging Exact Predictor Feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key challenges in design of predictor-based control laws for switched systems with arbitrary switching and long input delay are the potential unavailability of the future values of the switching signal (at current time) and the fact that dwell time may be arbitrary. In the present paper, we resolve these challenges developing a new predictor-based control law that is, essentially, an average of exact predictor feedbacks, each one corresponding to an exact predictor-feedback law for a system that operates only in a single mode. Because the predictor state in our control design does not correspond to an exact predictor, stability can be guaranteed under a restriction on the differences among the system's matrices and controller's gains. This is an unavoidable limitation, for a switching signal whose future values may be unavailable, when no constraint is imposed on the values of delay and dwell time (as it is the case here). We establish (uniform) stability of the closed-loop system employing a Lyapunov functional. The key step in the stability proof is constructive derivation of an estimate of the mismatch between an exact predictor feedback and the average of predictor feedbacks constructed. We illustrate the performance of the proposed predictor-based control law in simulation, including comparisons with alternative, predictor-based control laws.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Neural Network Transfer-Learning Model for Forecasting Problems with Continuous and Discrete Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a continuous-variable quantum neural network (CV-QNN) model designed as a transfer-learning approach for forecasting problems. The proposed quantum technique features a simple structure with only eight trainable parameters, a single quantum layer with two wires to create entanglement, and ten quantum gates, hence the name QNNet10, effectively mimicking the functionality of classical neural networks. A notable aspect is that the quantum network achieves high accuracy with random initialization after a single iteration. This pretrained model is innovative as it requires no training or parameter tuning when applied to new datasets, allowing for parameter freezing while enabling the addition of a final layer for fine-tuning. Additionally, an equivalent discrete-variable quantum neural network (DV-QNN) is presented, structured similarly to the CV model. However, analysis shows that the two-wire DV model does not significantly enhance performance. As a result, a four-wire DV model is proposed, achieving comparable results but requiring a larger and more complex structure with additional gates. The pretrained model is applied to five forecasting problems of varying sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Landmark-Aided Navigation Approach Using Side-Scan Sonar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cost-effective localization methods for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation are key for ocean monitoring and data collection at high resolution in time and space. Algorithmic solutions suitable for real-time processing that handle nonlinear measurement models and different forms of measurement uncertainty will accelerate the development of field-ready technology. This paper details a Bayesian estimation method for landmark-aided navigation using a Side-scan Sonar (SSS) sensor. The method bounds navigation filter error in the GPS-denied undersea environment and captures the highly nonlinear nature of slant range measurements while remaining computationally tractable. Combining a novel measurement model with the chosen statistical framework facilitates the efficient use of SSS data and, in the future, could be used in real time. The proposed filter has two primary steps: a prediction step using an unscented transform and an update step utilizing particles. The update step performs probabilistic association of sonar detections with known landmarks. We evaluate algorithm performance and tractability using synthetic data and real data collected field experiments. Field experiments were performed using two different marine robotic platforms with two different SSS and at two different sites. Finally, we discuss the computational requirements of the proposed method and how it extends to real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Explanations for Model Ensembles Using Entropic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations indicate the smallest change in input that can translate to a different outcome for a machine learning model. Counterfactuals have generated immense interest in high-stakes applications such as finance, education, hiring, etc. In several use-cases, the decision-making process often relies on an ensemble of models rather than just one. Despite significant research on counterfactuals for one model, the problem of generating a single counterfactual explanation for an ensemble of models has received limited interest. Each individual model might lead to a different counterfactual, whereas trying to find a counterfactual accepted by all models might significantly increase cost (effort). We propose a novel strategy to find the counterfactual for an ensemble of models using the perspective of entropic risk measure. Entropic risk is a convex risk measure that satisfies several desirable properties. We incorporate our proposed risk measure into a novel constrained optimization to generate counterfactuals for ensembles that stay valid for several models. The main significance of our measure is that it provides a knob that allows for the generation of counterfactuals that stay valid under an adjustable fraction of the models. We also show that a limiting case of our entropic-risk-based strategy yields a counterfactual valid for all models in the ensemble (worst-case min-max approach). We study the trade-off between the cost (effort) for the counterfactual and its validity for an ensemble by varying degrees of risk aversion, as determined by our risk parameter knob. We validate our performance on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Development in UAV Network Digital Twins with a Flexible Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance coverage and provide flexible deployment in 5G and next-generation wireless networks. The performance of such wireless networks can be improved by developing new navigation and wireless adaptation approaches in digital twins (DTs). However, challenges such as complex propagation conditions and hardware complexities in real-world scenarios introduce a realism gap with the DTs. Moreover, while using real-time full-stack protocols in DTs enables subsequent deployment and testing in a real-world environment, development in DTs requires high computational complexity and involves a long development time. In this paper, to accelerate the development cycle, we develop a measurement-calibrated Matlab-based simulation framework to replicate performance in a full-stack UAV wireless network DT. In particular, we use the DT from the NSF AERPAW platform and compare its reports with those generated by our developed simulation framework in wireless networks with similar settings. In both environments, we observe comparable results in terms of RSRP measurement, hence motivating iterative use of the developed simulation environment with the DT.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Contact-Rich Trajectory Optimization for Multi-Modal Manipulation using Tight Convex Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing trajectories for manipulation through contact is challenging as it requires reasoning of object \&amp; robot trajectories as well as complex contact sequences simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot \&amp; object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages. We also demonstrate our framework in hardware experiments using a bimanual robot system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous stores leverage advanced sensing technologies to enable cashier-less shopping, real-time inventory tracking, and seamless customer interactions. However, these systems face significant challenges, including occlusion in vision-based tracking, scalability of sensor deployment, theft prevention, and real-time data processing. To address these issues, researchers have explored multi-modal sensing approaches, integrating computer vision, RFID, weight sensing, vibration-based detection, and LiDAR to enhance accuracy and efficiency. This survey provides a comprehensive review of sensing technologies used in autonomous retail environments, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and integration strategies. We categorize existing solutions across inventory tracking, environmental monitoring, people-tracking, and theft detection, discussing key challenges and emerging trends. Finally, we outline future directions for scalable, cost-efficient, and privacy-conscious autonomous store systems.</description>

      <title>Elastic Motion Policy: An Adaptive Dynamical System for Robust and Efficient One-Shot Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) has become a staple imitation learning paradigm in robotics due to its ease of teaching robots complex skills directly from expert demonstrations. However, BC suffers from an inherent generalization issue. To solve this, the status quo solution is to gather more data. Yet, regardless of how much training data is available, out-of-distribution performance is still sub-par, lacks any formal guarantee of convergence and success, and is incapable of allowing and recovering from physical interactions with humans. These are critical flaws when robots are deployed in ever-changing human-centric environments. Thus, we propose Elastic Motion Policy (EMP), a one-shot imitation learning framework that allows robots to adjust their behavior based on the scene change while respecting the task specification. Trained from a single demonstration, EMP follows the dynamical systems paradigm where motion planning and control are governed by first-order differential equations with convergence guarantees. We leverage Laplacian editing in full end-effector space, $\mathbb{R}^3\times SO(3)$, and online convex learning of Lyapunov functions, to adapt EMP online to new contexts, avoiding the need to collect new demonstrations. We extensively validate our framework in real robot experiments, demonstrating its robust and efficient performance in dynamic environments, with obstacle avoidance and multi-step task capabilities.

      <title>Observer-Based Output-Feedback Backstepping Stabilization of Continua of Hyperbolic PDEs and Application to Large-Scale $n+m$ Coupled Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-collocated, observer-based output-feedback law for a class of continua of linear hyperbolic PDE systems, which are viewed as the continuum version of $n+m$, general heterodirectional hyperbolic systems as $n\to\infty$. The design relies on the introduction of a novel, continuum PDE backstepping transformation, which enables the construction of a Lyapunov functional for the estimation error system. Stability under the observer-based output-feedback law is established by using the Lyapunov functional construction for the estimation error system and proving well-posedness of the complete closed-loop system, which allows utilization of the separation principle.
  Motivated by the fact that the continuum-based designs may provide computationally tractable control laws for large-scale, $n+m$ systems, we then utilize the control/observer kernels and the observer constructed for the continuum system to introduce an output-feedback control design for the original $n+m$ system. We establish exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system, which consists of a mixed $n+m$-continuum PDE system (comprising the plant-observer dynamics), introducing a virtual continuum system with resets, which enables utilization of the continuum approximation property of the solutions of the $n+m$ system by its continuum counterpart (for large $n$). We illustrate the potential computational complexity/flexibility benefits of our approach via a numerical example of stabilization of a large-scale $n+m$ system, for which we employ the continuum observer-based controller, while the continuum-based stabilizing control/observer kernels can be computed in closed form.</description>

      <title>Safety-Ensured Control Framework for Robotic Endoscopic Task Automation</title>

Abstract: There is growing interest in automating surgical tasks using robotic systems, such as endoscopy for treating gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. However, previous studies have primarily focused on detecting and analyzing objects or robots, with limited attention to ensuring safety, which is critical for clinical applications, where accidents can be caused by unsafe robot motions. In this study, we propose a new control framework that can formally ensure the safety of automating certain processes involved in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a representative endoscopic surgical method for the treatment of early GI cancer, by using an endoscopic robot. The proposed framework utilizes Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to accurately identify the boundaries of individual tumors, even in close proximity within the GI tract, ensuring precise treatment and removal while preserving the surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, by adopting a model-free control scheme, safety assurance is made possible even in endoscopic robotic systems where dynamic modeling is challenging. We demonstrate the proposed framework in cases where the tumors to be removed are close to each other, showing that the safety constraints are enforced. We show that the model-free CBF-based controlled robot eliminates one tumor completely without damaging it, while not invading another nearby tumor.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Safety Guarantees in Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many practical scenarios of black box optimization, the objective function is subject to constraints that must be satisfied to avoid undesirable outcomes. Such constraints are typically unknown and must be learned during optimization. Safe Bayesian optimization aims to find the global optimum while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied with high probability. However, it is often sample-inefficient due to the small initial feasible set, which requires expansion by evaluating the objective or constraint functions, limiting its applicability to low-dimensional or inexpensive problems. To enhance sample efficiency, additional information from cheap simulations can be leveraged, albeit at the cost of safeness guarantees. This paper introduces a novel safe multi-task Bayesian optimization algorithm that integrates multiple tasks while maintaining high-probability safety. We derive robust uniform error bounds for the multi-task case and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on benchmark functions and a control problem. Our results show a significant improvement in sample efficiency, making the proposed method well-suited for expensive-to-evaluate functions.</description>

      <title>From Classification to Optimization: Slicing and Resource Management with TRACTOR</title>

Abstract: 5G and beyond networks promise advancements in bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework enhances flexibility through network slicing and closed-loop RAN control. Central to this evolution is integrating machine learning (ML) for dynamic network control. This paper presents a framework to optimize O-RAN operation. First, we build and share a robust O-RAN dataset from real-world traffic captured across diverse locations and mobility scenarios, replicated within a full-stack srsRAN-based O-RAN system using the Colosseum RF emulator. This dataset supports ML training and deployment. We then introduce a traffic classification approach leveraging various ML models, demonstrating rapid training, testing, and refinement to improve accuracy. With up to 99% offline accuracy and 92% online accuracy for specific slices, our framework adapts efficiently to different models and network conditions. Finally, we present a physical resource block (PRB) assignment optimization strategy using reinforcement learning to refine resource allocation. Our learned policy achieves a mean performance score (0.631), surpassing a manually configured expert policy (0.609) and a random baseline (0.588), demonstrating improved PRB utilization. More importantly, our approach exhibits lower variability, with the Coefficient of Variation (CV) reduced by up to an order of magnitude in three out of four cases, ensuring more consistent performance. Our contributions, including open-source tools and datasets, accelerate O-RAN and ML-driven network control research.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses the experiences gained from designing, deploying, and maintaining low-power Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in three geothermally active remote locations in Iceland. The network was deployed for environmental monitoring and real-time data collection to assist in investigating the impact of global warming on the (sub)Arctic climate and the resulting carbon release from the region. Functional networks with more than 50 sensor nodes from three sites with extreme weather conditions and hard-to-access terrain have been collecting data since 2021. The networks employ primary cell-powered wireless sensor nodes equipped with DASH7 Alliance Protocol (D7A) for low-power data transmission and solar-powered D7A-cellular gateways for the backend connection. The WSNs have so far achieved over three years of uptime with minimal maintenance required throughout this period. We present a detailed discussion of different network components, their architecture, and the networks' overall performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Assessing Electricity Network Capacity Requirements for Industrial Decarbonisation in Great Britain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decarbonising the industrial sector is vital to reach net zero targets. The deployment of industrial decarbonisation technologies is expected to increase industrial electricity demand in many countries and this may require upgrades to the existing electricity network or new network investment. While the infrastructure requirements to support the introduction of new fuels and technologies in industry, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage are often discussed, the need for investment to increase the capacity of the electricity network to meet increasing industrial electricity demands is often overlooked in the literature. This paper addresses this gap by quantifying the requirements for additional electricity network capacity to support the decarbonisation of industrial sectors across Great Britain (GB). The Net Zero Industrial Pathways model is used to predict the future electricity demand from industrial sites to 2050 which is then compared spatially to the available headroom across the distribution network in GB. The results show that network headroom is sufficient to meet extra capacity demands from industrial sites over the period to 2030 in nearly all GB regions and network scenarios. However, as electricity demand rises due to increased electrification across all sectors and industrial decarbonisation accelerates towards 2050, the network will need significant new capacity (71 GW + by 2050) particularly in the central, south, and north-west regions of England, and Wales. Without solving these network constraints, around 65% of industrial sites that are large point sources of emissions would be constrained in terms of electric capacity by 2040. These sites are responsible for 69% of industrial point source emissions.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Safe Bayesian Optimization for Automotive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controller tuning is a labor-intensive process that requires human intervention and expert knowledge. Bayesian optimization has been applied successfully in different fields to automate this process. However, when tuning on hardware, such as in automotive applications, strict safety requirements often arise. To obtain safety guarantees, many existing safe Bayesian optimization methods rely on assumptions that are hard to verify in practice. This leads to the use of unjustified heuristics in many applications, which invalidates the theoretical safety guarantees. Furthermore, applications often require multiple safety constraints to be satisfied simultaneously. Building on recently proposed Lipschitz-only safe Bayesian optimization, we develop an algorithm that relies on readily interpretable assumptions and satisfies multiple safety constraints at the same time. We apply this algorithm to the problem of automatically tuning a trajectory-tracking controller of a self-driving car. Results both from simulations and an actual test vehicle underline the algorithm's ability to learn tracking controllers without leaving the track or violating any other safety constraints.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Nonlinear Parametric Models under Non-smooth Regularization using EKF and ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of extended Kalman filtering (EKF) with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for learning parametric nonlinear models online under non-smooth regularization terms, including l1 and l0 penalties and bound constraints on model parameters. For the case of linear time-varying models and non-smoothconvex regularization terms, we provide a sublinear regret bound that ensures the proper behavior of the online learning strategy. The approach is computationally efficient for a wide range of regularization terms, which makes it appealing for its use in embedded control applications for online model adaptation. We show the performance of the proposed method in three simulation examples, highlighting its effectiveness compared to other batch and online algorithms.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for residential and commercial HVAC: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. This paper reviews 24 field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Tube-based Model Predictive Control for Cyber-Physical Systems under False Data Injection Attacks with Bounded Probability</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of amplitude-unbounded false data injection (FDI) attacks targeting the sensor-to-controller (S-C) channel in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional knowledge representations in reinforcement learning (RL) facilitate modular, interpretable, and safe task specifications. However, generating compositional models requires the characterization of minimal assumptions for the robustness of the compositionality feature, especially in the case of functional decompositions. Using a categorical point of view, we develop a knowledge representation framework for a compositional theory of RL. Our approach relies on the theoretical study of the category $\mathsf{MDP}$, whose objects are Markov decision processes (MDPs) acting as models of tasks. The categorical semantics models the compositionality of tasks through the application of pushout operations akin to combining puzzle pieces. As a practical application of these pushout operations, we introduce zig-zag diagrams that rely on the compositional guarantees engendered by the category $\mathsf{MDP}$. We further prove that properties of the category $\mathsf{MDP}$ unify concepts, such as enforcing safety requirements and exploiting symmetries, generalizing previous abstraction theories for RL.</description>

      <title>SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.</description>

      <title>Multilinear Extensions in Submodular Optimization for Optimal Sensor Scheduling in Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal sensing nodes selection (SNS) in dynamic systems is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been thoroughly studied in the recent literature. This problem can be formulated within the context of set optimization. For high-dimensional nonlinear systems, the problem is extremely difficult to solve. It scales poorly too. Current literature poses combinatorial submodular set optimization problems via maximizing observability performance metrics subject to matroid constraints. Such an approach is typically solved using greedy algorithms that require lower computational effort yet often yield sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we address the SNS problem for nonlinear dynamical networks using a variational form of the system dynamics, that basically perturb the system physics. As a result, we show that the observability performance metrics under such system representation are indeed submodular. The optimal problem is then solved using the multilinear continuous extension. This extension offers a computationally scalable and approximate continuous relaxation with a performance guarantee. The effectiveness of the extended submodular program is studied and compared to greedy algorithms. We demonstrate the proposed set optimization formulation for SNS on nonlinear natural gas combustion networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new C++/CUDA library for GPU-accelerated stochastic optimization called MPPI-Generic. It provides implementations of Model Predictive Path Integral control, Tube-Model Predictive Path Integral Control, and Robust Model Predictive Path Integral Control, and allows for these algorithms to be used across many pre-existing dynamics models and cost functions. Furthermore, researchers can create their own dynamics models or cost functions following our API definitions without needing to change the actual Model Predictive Path Integral Control code. Finally, we compare computational performance to other popular implementations of Model Predictive Path Integral Control over a variety of GPUs to show the real-time capabilities our library can allow for.

      <title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</description>

      <title>A Parallel-in-Time Newton's Method for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful framework for optimal control of dynamical systems. However, MPC solvers suffer from a high computational burden that restricts their application to systems with low sampling frequency. This issue is further amplified in nonlinear and constrained systems that require nesting MPC solvers within iterative procedures. In this paper, we address these issues by developing parallel-in-time algorithms for constrained nonlinear optimization problems that take advantage of massively parallel hardware to achieve logarithmic computational time scaling over the planning horizon. We develop time-parallel second-order solvers based on interior point methods and the alternating direction method of multipliers, leveraging fast convergence and lower computational cost per iteration. The parallelization is based on a reformulation of the subproblems in terms of associative operations that can be parallelized using the associative scan algorithm. We validate our approach on numerical examples of nonlinear and constrained dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Online Control-Informed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an Online Control-Informed Learning (OCIL) framework, which employs the well-established optimal control and state estimation techniques in the field of control to solve a broad class of learning tasks in an online fashion. This novel integration effectively handles practical issues in machine learning such as noisy measurement data, online learning, and data efficiency. By considering any robot as a tunable optimal control system, we propose an online parameter estimator based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) to incrementally tune the system in an online fashion, enabling it to complete designated learning or control tasks. The proposed method also improves the robustness in learning by effectively managing noise in the data. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the convergence of OCIL. Three learning modes of OCIL, i.e. Online Imitation Learning, Online System Identification, and Policy Tuning On-the-fly, are investigated via experiments, which validate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics Framework for Complex Engineering Systems Exhibiting Multiple Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex engineering systems are often subject to multiple failure modes. Developing a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model that does not consider the failure mode causing degradation is likely to result in inaccurate predictions. However, distinguishing between causes of failure without manually inspecting the system is nontrivial. This challenge is increased when the causes of historically observed failures are unknown. Sensors, which are useful for monitoring the state-of-health of systems, can also be used for distinguishing between multiple failure modes as the presence of multiple failure modes results in discriminatory behavior of the sensor signals. When systems are equipped with multiple sensors, some sensors may exhibit behavior correlated with degradation, while other sensors do not. Furthermore, which sensors exhibit this behavior may differ for each failure mode. In this paper, we present a simultaneous clustering and sensor selection approach for unlabeled training datasets of systems exhibiting multiple failure modes. The cluster assignments and the selected sensors are then utilized in real-time to first diagnose the active failure mode and then to predict the system RUL. We validate the methodology using a simulated dataset of systems exhibiting two failure modes and on NASA turbofan degradation dataset.</description>

      <title>TinySense: A Lighter Weight and More Power-efficient Avionics System for Flying Insect-scale Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce advances in the sensor suite of an autonomous flying insect robot (FIR) weighing less than a gram. FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.</description>

      <title>Intra-day Solar and Power Forecast for Optimization of Intraday Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</description>
