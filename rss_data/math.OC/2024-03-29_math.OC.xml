      <title>Characterizing Controllability and Observability for Systems with Locality, Communication, and Actuation Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a closed-form notion of controllability and observability for systems with communication delays, actuation delays, and locality constraints. The formulation reduces to classical notions of controllability and observability in the unconstrained setting. As a consequence of our formulation, we show that the addition of locality and communication constraints may not affect the controllability and observability of the system, and we provide an efficient sufficient condition under which this phenomenon occurs. This contrasts with actuation and sensing delays, which cause a gradual loss of controllability and observability as the delays increase. We illustrate our results using linearized swing equations for the power grid, showing how actuation delay and locality constraints affect controllability.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of linear Port-Hamiltonian Descriptor Systems via Output Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure preserving stabilization of (possibly non-regular) linear port-Hamiltonian descriptor (pHDAE) systems by output feedback is discussed. While for general descriptor systems the characterization when there exist output feedbacks that lead to an asymptotically stable closed loop system is a very hard and partially open problem, for systems in pHDAE representation this problem can be completely solved. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented that guarantee that there exist a proportional output feedback such that the resulting closed-loop port-Hamiltonian descriptor system is (robustly) asymptotically stable. For this it is also necessary that the output feedback also makes the problem regular and of index at most one. A complete characterization when this is possible is presented as well.</description>

      <title>Policy iteration for discrete-time systems with discounted costs: stability and near-optimality guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a discounted cost, we study deterministic discrete-time systems whose inputs are generated by policy iteration (PI). We provide novel near-optimality and stability properties, while allowing for non stabilizing initial policies. That is, we first give novel bounds on the mismatch between the value function generated by PI and the optimal value function, which are less conservative in general than those encountered in the dynamic programming literature for the considered class of systems. Then, we show that the system in closed-loop with policies generated by PI are stabilizing under mild conditions, after a finite (and known) number of iterations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discrete ensembles of linear, scalar control systems with single-inputs. Assuming that all the individual systems are unstable, we investigate whether there exist linear feedback control laws that can asymptotically stabilize the ensemble system. We provide necessary/sufficient conditions for feasibility of pole placement in the left half plane and for feedback stabilizability of the ensemble systems.</description>

      <title>Locational Marginal Prices Obey DC Circuit Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity markets often utilize the DC approximation of the AC power flow equations to facilitate solving an otherwise complex nonconvex optimization problem. These DC power flow equations have analogies to DC circuit laws such as Kirchhoff's Laws, resulting in an intuitive understanding of power flows under this model. Variables derived from the Lagrangian dual of the DC optimal power flow problem, such as locational marginal prices (LMPs) and congestion cost, are less intuitive without an understanding of optimization theory. Even with this understanding, LMP behavior, such as the conditions in which negative prices occur or the impact of individual congested lines on network-wide LMPs, remain somewhat mysterious. In this paper, we show that prices also obey DC circuit laws, which can help facilitate an intuitive understanding of their behavior and relationships throughout a network without explicitly understanding duality. In particular, prices can be modeled as voltages, and their differences can be modeled as flows, allowing for a physical interpretation of prices. This analogy also lends itself to the use of well-understood DC circuit concepts such as superposition and Kirchhoff's Laws, which can further facilitate a clearer understanding of price behavior.</description>

      <title>Cardinality Constraints in Single-Leader-Multi-Follower games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores bilevel problems in the context of cardinality constraints. More specifically Single-Leader-Multi-Follower games (SLMFG) involving cardinality constraints are considered in two different configurations: one with the cardinality constraint at the leader's level and a mixed structure in which the cardinality constraint is split between leader and followers problem. We prove existence results in both cases and provided equivalent reformulations allowing the numerical treatment of these complex problems. The obtained results are illustrated thanks to an application to a facility location problem.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Time-Varying Optimization via Derivative Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms have a rich and fundamental relationship with ordinary differential equations given by its continuous-time limit. When the cost function varies with time -- typically in response to a dynamically changing environment -- online optimization becomes a continuous-time trajectory tracking problem. To accommodate these time variations, one typically requires some inherent knowledge about their nature such as a time derivative.
  In this paper, we propose a novel construction and analysis of a continuous-time derivative estimation scheme based on "dirty-derivatives", and show how it naturally interfaces with continuous-time optimization algorithms using the language of ISS (Input-to-State Stability). More generally, we show how a simple Lyapunov redesign technique leads to provable suboptimality guarantees when composing this estimator with any well-behaved optimization algorithm for time-varying costs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Nonlinear Model Predictive Control by Leveraging Linear Parameter-Varying Embedding and Sequential Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we are concerned with nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) schemes that, through the linear parameter-varying (LPV) formulation, nonlinear systems can be embedded and with a sequential quadratic program (SQP) can provide efficient solutions for the NMPC. We revisit the different constrained optimization formulations known as simultaneous and sequential approaches tailored with the LPV predictor, constituting, in general, a nonlinear program (NLP). The derived NLPs are represented through the Lagrangian formulation, which enforces the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for the optimization problem to be solvable. The main novelty suggests that the problem can still be efficiently solvable with a significantly lower computational load by approximating certain terms to reduce the computational burden. The proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art approaches on standard performance measures. Moreover, we provide convergence analysis that can assert further theoretical guarantees in control, such as stability and recursive feasibility. Finally, the method is tested through well-studied control benchmarks such as the forced Van der Pol oscillator and the dynamic unicycle.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the Convergence Speed of PDHG to Find Better Primal and Dual Step Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primal-dual algorithms for the resolution of convex-concave saddle point problems usually come with one or several step size parameters. Within the range where convergence is guaranteed, choosing well the step size can make the difference between a slow or a fast algorithm. A usual way to adaptively set step sizes is to ensure that there is a fair balance between primal and dual variable's amount of change. In this work, we show how to find even better step sizes for the primal-dual hybrid gradient. Getting inspiration from quadratic problems, we base our method on a spectral radius estimation procedure and try to minimize this spectral radius, which is directly related to the rate of convergence. Building on power iterations, we could produce spectral radius estimates that are always smaller than 1 and work also in the case of conjugate principal eigenvalues. For strongly convex quadratics, we show that our step size rule yields an algorithm as fast as inertial gradient descent. Moreover, since our spectral radius estimates only rely on residual norms, our method can be readily adapted to more general convex-concave saddle point problems. In a second part, we extend these results to a randomized version of PDHG called PURE-CD. We design a statistical test to compare observed convergence rates and decide whether a step size is better than another. Numerical experiments on least squares, sparse SVM, TV-L1 denoising and TV-L2 denoising problems support our findings.</description>

      <title>Rapid nonlinear convex guidance via overparameterized monomial coordinates and fundamental solution expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework by which the nonlinear trajectory optimization problem is posed as a path-planning problem in a space liberated of dynamics. In this space, general state constraints for continuous and impulsive control problems are encoded as linear constraints on the native overparameterized variables. This framework is enabled by nonlinear expansion in the vicinity of a reference in terms of fundamental solutions and a minimal nonlinear basis of mixed monomials in problem initial conditions. The former can be computed using state transition tensors, differential algebra, or analytic approaches, and the latter is computed analytically. Nonlinear guidance schemes are proposed taking advantage of this framework, including a successive convex programming scheme for delta-V minimizing trajectory optimization. This work enables a stable and highly rapid nonlinear guidance implementation without the need for collocation or real-time integration.</description>

      <title>A diving heuristic for mixed-integer problems with unbounded semi-continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-continuous decision variables arise naturally in many real-world applications. They are defined to take either value zero or any value within a specified range, and occur mainly to prevent small nonzero values in the solution. One particular challenge that can come with semi-continuous variables in practical models is that their upper bound may be large or even infinite. In this article, we briefly discuss these challenges, and present a new diving heuristic tailored for mixed-integer optimization problems with general semi-continuous variables. The heuristic is designed to work independently of whether the semi-continuous variables are bounded from above, and thus circumvents the specific difficulties that come with unbounded semi-continuous variables. We conduct extensive computational experiments on three different test sets, integrating the heuristic in an open-source MIP solver. The results indicate that this heuristic is a successful tool for finding high-quality solutions in negligible time. At the root node the primal gap is reduced by an average of 5 % up to 21 %, and considering the overall performance improvement, the primal integral is reduced by 2 % to 17 % on average.</description>

      <title>The largest-$K$-norm for general measure spaces and a DC Reformulation for $L^0$-Constrained Problems in Function Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the measure of the support for integrable functions on arbitrary measure spaces. It is shown that this non-convex and discontinuous constraint can be equivalently reformulated by the difference of two convex and continuous functions, namely the $L^1$-norm and the so-called largest-$K$-norm. The largest-$K$-norm is studied and its convex subdifferential is derived. An exemplary problem is solved by applying a DC method to the reformulated problem.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows of Linear Programs and State-Action Natural Policy Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kakade's natural policy gradient method has been studied extensively in the last years showing linear convergence with and without regularization. We study another natural gradient method which is based on the Fisher information matrix of the state-action distributions and has received little attention from the theoretical side. Here, the state-action distributions follow the Fisher-Rao gradient flow inside the state-action polytope with respect to a linear potential. Therefore, we study Fisher-Rao gradient flows of linear programs more generally and show linear convergence with a rate that depends on the geometry of the linear program. Equivalently, this yields an estimate on the error induced by entropic regularization of the linear program which improves existing results. We extend these results and show sublinear convergence for perturbed Fisher-Rao gradient flows and natural gradient flows up to an approximation error. In particular, these general results cover the case of state-action natural policy gradients.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a Class of Large-Scale Systems of Linear Hyperbolic PDEs via Continuum Approximation of Exact Backstepping Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that stabilization of a class of linear, hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a large (nevertheless finite) number of components, can be achieved via employment of a backstepping-based control law, which is constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (i.e., as the number of components tends to infinity) of the PDE system. This is achieved by proving that the exact backstepping kernels, constructed for stabilization of the large-scale system, can be approximated (in certain sense such that exponential stability is preserved) by the backstepping kernels constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (essentially an infinite ensemble) of the original PDE system. The proof relies on construction of a convergent sequence of backstepping kernels that is defined such that each kernel matches the exact backstepping kernels (derived based on the original, large-scale system), in a piecewise constant manner with respect to an ensemble variable; while showing that they satisfy the continuum backstepping kernel equations. We present a numerical example that reveals that complexity of computation of stabilizing backstepping kernels may not scale with the number of components of the PDE state, when the kernels are constructed on the basis of the continuum version, in contrast to the case in which they are constructed on the basis of the original, large-scale system. In addition, we formally establish the connection between the solutions to the large-scale system and its continuum counterpart. Thus, this approach can be useful for design of computationally tractable, stabilizing backstepping-based control laws for large-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Network Flow Models for Robust Binary Optimization with Selective Adaptability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive robust optimization problems have received significant attention in recent years, but remain notoriously difficult to solve when recourse decisions are discrete in nature. In this paper, we propose new reformulation techniques for adaptive robust binary optimization (ARBO) problems with objective uncertainty. Without loss of generality, we focus on ARBO problems with "selective adaptability", a term we coin to describe a common class of linking constraints between first-stage and second-stage solutions. Our main contribution revolves around a collection of exact and approximate network flow reformulations for the ARBO problem, which we develop by building upon ideas from the decision diagram literature. Our proposed models can generate feasible solutions, primal bounds and dual bounds, while their size and approximation quality can be precisely controlled through user-specified parameters. Furthermore, and in contrast with existing solution methods, these models are easy to implement and can be solved directly with standard off-the-shelf solvers. Through an extensive set of computational experiments, we show that our models can generate high-quality solutions and dual bounds in significantly less time than popular benchmark methods, often by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Solving the waste bin location problem with uncertain waste generation rate: a bi-objective robust optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient Municipal solid waste (MSW) system is critical to modern cities in order to enhance sustainability and livability of urban life. With this aim, the planning phase of the MSW system should be carefully addressed by decision makers. However, planning success is dependent on many sources of uncertainty that can affect key parameters of the system, e.g., the waste generation rate in an urban area. With this in mind, this paper contributes with a robust optimization model to design the network of collection points (i.e., location and storage capacity), which are the first points of contact with the MSW system. A central feature of the model is a bi-objective function that aims at simultaneously minimizing the network costs of collection points and the required collection frequency to gather the accumulated waste (as a proxy of the collection cost). The value of the model is demonstrated by comparing its solutions with those obtained from its deterministic counterpart over a set of realistic instances considering different scenarios defined by different waste generation rates. The results show that the robust model finds competitive solutions in almost all cases investigated. An additional benefit of the model is that it allows the user to explore trade-offs between the two objectives.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust monopoly pricing: Switching from low to high prices in volatile markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional monopoly pricing assumes sellers have full information about consumer valuations. We consider monopoly pricing under limited information, where a seller only knows the mean, variance and support of the valuation distribution. The objective is to maximize expected revenue by selecting the optimal fixed price. We adopt a distributionally robust framework, where the seller considers all valuation distributions that comply with the limited information. We formulate a maximin problem which seeks to maximize expected revenue for the worst-case valuation distribution. The minimization problem that identifies the worst-case valuation distribution is solved using primal-dual methods, and in turn leads to an explicitly solvable maximization problem. This yields a closed-form optimal pricing policy and a new fundamental principle prescribing when to use low and high robust prices. We show that the optimal policy switches from low to high prices when variance becomes sufficiently large, yielding significant performance gains compared with existing robust prices that generally decay with market uncertainty. This presents guidelines for when the seller should switch from targeting mass markets to niche markets. Similar guidelines are obtained for delay-prone services with rational utility-maximizing customers, underlining the universality and wide applicability of the low-high pricing principle.</description>

      <title>The profit-oriented hub line location problem with elastic demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with an extension of the hub line location problem considering demand elasticity with respect to travel times. The proposed model aims to capture the impact the hub network topology has on demand. The objective is to maximize the total revenue generated by each unit of demand using the hub line. We propose mixed-integer nonlinear formulations to model this problem. We study some properties of the nonlinear objective function associated with these formulations. Due to the inherent complexity involved in solving these nonlinear formulations with state-of-the-art solvers, we also present alternative mixed-integer linear programming formulations. Computational results compare the proposed formulations and the benefits of the presented model using benchmark instances commonly used in hub location. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis study is carried out with real data from the city of Montreal, Canada, to demonstrate the added value of incorporating demand elasticity when using the proposed model for public transportation planning.</description>

      <title>Multi-product maximal covering second-level facility location problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new hierarchical facility location model with three levels: first-level facilities which manufacture different products, second-level facilities which act as warehouses and a third-level consisting of the clients who demand the products that have been manufactured in the first level and stored in the second level. In this model, called multi-product maximal covering second-level facility location problem (SL-MCFLP), the aim is to decide the location of the second-level facilities and the products to be stored in each of them maximizing the overall clients' satisfaction with respect their coverage. To deal with this model, we introduce a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) which is reinforced by some families of valid inequalities. Since some of these families have an exponential number of constraints, separation algorithms are proposed. In addition, three variants of a matheuristic procedure are developed. Computational studies are included, showing the potentials and limits of the formulation and the effectiveness of the heuristic.</description>

      <title>Energy-Optimal Multi-Agent Navigation as a Strategic-Form Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This extended abstracts presents a method to generate energy-optimal trajectories for multi-agent systems as a strategic-form game. Using recent results in optimal control, we demonstrate that an energy-optimal trajectory can be generated in milliseconds if the sequence of constraint activations is known a priori. Thus, rather than selecting an infinite-dimensional action from a function space, the agents select their actions from a finite number of constraints and determine the time that each becomes active. Furthermore, the agents can exactly encode their trajectory in a set of real numbers, rather than communicating their control action as an infinite-dimensional function. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm in simulation and find an optimal trajectory in 45 milliseconds on a tablet PC.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in Large Language Model Integrated 6G Vehicular Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the upcoming 6G era, vehicular networks are shifting from simple Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to the more complex Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity. At the forefront of this shift is the incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into vehicles. Known for their sophisticated natural language processing abilities, LLMs change how users interact with their vehicles. This integration facilitates voice-driven commands and interactions, departing from the conventional manual control systems. However, integrating LLMs into vehicular systems presents notable challenges. The substantial computational demands and energy requirements of LLMs pose significant challenges, especially in the constrained environment of a vehicle. Additionally, the time-sensitive nature of tasks in vehicular networks adds another layer of complexity. In this paper, we consider an edge computing system where vehicles process the initial layers of LLM computations locally, and offload the remaining LLM computation tasks to the Roadside Units (RSUs), envisioning a vehicular ecosystem where LLM computations seamlessly interact with the ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth capabilities of 6G networks. To balance the trade-off between completion time and energy consumption, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the vehicles and RSUs. The problem is then decomposed into two sub-problems, which are solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method and fractional programming technique. The simulation results clearly indicate that the algorithm we have proposed is highly effective in reducing both the completion time and energy consumption of the system.</description>

      <title>Efficient global estimation of conditional-value-at-risk through stochastic kriging and extreme value theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating risk for a system that is modeled by a complex stochastic simulation with many possible input parameter values. Two sources of computational burden can be identified: the effort associated with extensive simulation runs required to accurately represent the tail of the loss distribution for each set of parameter values, and the computational cost of evaluating multiple candidate parameter values. The former concern can be addressed by using Extreme Value Theory (EVT) estimations, which specifically concentrate on the tails. Meta-modeling approaches are often used to tackle the latter concern. In this paper, we propose a framework for constructing a particular meta-modeling framework, stochastic kriging, that is based on EVT-based estimation for a class of coherent measures of risk. The proposed approach requires an efficient estimator of the intrinsic variance, and so we derive an EVT-based expression for it. It then allows us to avoid multiple replications of the risk measure in each design point, which was required in similar previously proposed approaches, resulting in a substantial reduction in computational effort. We then perform a case study, outlining promising use cases, and conditions when the EVT-based approach outperforms simpler empirical estimators.</description>

      <title>The sticky particle dynamics of the 1D pressureless Euler-alignment system as a gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the sticky dynamics for the one-dimensional pressureless Euler-alignment system can be obtained as an $L^2$-gradient flow of a convex functional. This is analogous to the Lagrangian evolution introduced by Natile and Savar\'{e} for the pressureless Euler system, and by Brenier et al. for the corresponding system with a self-interacting force field. Our Lagrangian evolution can be seen as the limit of sticky particle Cucker-Smale dynamics, similar to the solutions obtained by Leslie and Tan from a corresponding scalar balance law, and provides us with a uniquely determined distributional solution of the original system in the space of probability measures with quadratic moments and corresponding square-integrable velocities. Moreover, we show that the gradient flow also provides an entropy solution to the balance law of Leslie and Tan, and how their results on cluster formation follow naturally from (non-)convexity properties of the so-called natural velocity of the flow.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Planning and Control for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic obstacle avoidance is a challenging topic for optimal control and optimization-based trajectory planning problems, especially when in a tight environment. Many existing works use control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce safety constraints within control systems. Inside these works, CBFs are usually formulated under model predictive control (MPC) framework to anticipate future states and make informed decisions, or integrated with path planning algorithms as a safety enhancement tool. However, these approaches usually require knowledge of the obstacle boundary equations or have very slow computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to the iterative MPC with discrete-time CBFs (DCBFs) to generate a collision-free trajectory. The DCBFs are obtained from convex polyhedra generated in sequential grid maps, without the need to know the boundary equations of obstacles. Additionally, a path planning algorithm is incorporated into this framework to ensure the global optimality of the generated trajectory. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our framework enables a unicycle robot to safely and efficiently navigate through tight and dynamically changing environments, tackling both convex and nonconvex obstacles with remarkable computing efficiency and reliability in control and trajectory generation.</description>

      <title>Improving the Bit Complexity of Communication for Distributed Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the communication complexity of some fundamental convex optimization problems in the point-to-point (coordinator) and blackboard communication models. We strengthen known bounds for approximately solving linear regression, $p$-norm regression (for $1\leq p\leq 2$), linear programming, minimizing the sum of finitely many convex nonsmooth functions with varying supports, and low rank approximation; for a number of these fundamental problems our bounds are nearly optimal, as proven by our lower bounds.
  Among our techniques, we use the notion of block leverage scores, which have been relatively unexplored in this context, as well as dropping all but the ``middle" bits in Richardson-style algorithms. We also introduce a new communication problem for accurately approximating inner products and establish a lower bound using the spherical Radon transform. Our lower bound can be used to show the first separation of linear programming and linear systems in the distributed model when the number of constraints is polynomial, addressing an open question in prior work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. Here, we frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in a complex foodweb lead to harder ill-conditioned problems, manifesting as slow modes on a nearly-degenerate solution landscape. Common dimensionality reduction methods precondition ecological dynamics, by isolating fast relaxation from slow solving timescales that exhibit transient chaos for harder problem instances. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using complexity bounds for constrained optimization. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gain-Only Neural Operator Approximators of PDE Backstepping Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the recently introduced deep learning-powered approach to PDE backstepping control, we present an advancement applicable across all the results developed thus far: approximating the control gain function only (a function of one variable), rather than the entire kernel function of the backstepping transformation (a function of two variables). We introduce this idea on a couple benchmark (unstable) PDEs, hyperbolic and parabolic. We alter the approach of quantifying the effect of the approximation error by replacing a backstepping transformation that employs the approximated kernel (suitable for adaptive control) by a transformation that employs the exact kernel (suitable for gain scheduling). A major simplification in the target system arises, with the perturbation due to the approximation shifting from the domain to the boundary condition. This results in a significant difference in the Lyapunov analysis, which nevertheless results in a guarantee of the stability being retained with the simplified approximation approach. The approach of approximating only the control gain function simplifies the operator being approximated and the training of its neural approximation, with an expected reduction in the neural network size. The price for the savings in approximation is paid through a somewhat more intricate Lyapunov analysis, in higher Sobolev spaces for some PDEs, as well as some restrictions on initial conditions that result from higher Sobolev spaces. While the proposed approach appears inapplicable to uses in adaptive control, it is almost certainly applicable in gain scheduling applications of neural operator-approximated PDE backstepping controllers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.09149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical method for calculating the operational value of an energy storage device under multi-stage price uncertainties. Our solution calculates the storage value function from price distribution functions directly instead of sampling discrete scenarios, offering improved modeling accuracy over tail distribution events such as price spikes and negative prices. The analytical algorithm offers very high computational efficiency in solving multi-stage stochastic programming for energy storage and can easily be implemented within any software and hardware platform, while numerical simulation results show the proposed method is up to 100,000 times faster than a benchmark stochastic-dual dynamic programming solver even in small test cases. Case studies are included to demonstrate the impact of price variability on the valuation results, and a battery charging example using historical prices for New York City.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove tight H\"olderian error bounds for all $p$-cones. Surprisingly, the exponents differ in several ways from those that have been previously conjectured; moreover, they illuminate $p$-cones as a curious example of a class of objects that possess properties in 3 dimensions that they do not in 4 or more. Using our error bounds, we analyse least squares problems with $p$-norm regularization, where our results enable us to compute the corresponding KL exponents for previously inaccessible values of $p$. Another application is a (relatively) simple proof that most $p$-cones are neither self-dual nor homogeneous. Our error bounds are obtained under the framework of facial residual functions, and we expand it by establishing for general cones an optimality criterion under which the resulting error bound must be tight.</description>

Abstract: Hierarchical decision making problems, such as bilevel programs and Stackelberg games, are attracting increasing interest in both the engineering and machine learning communities. Yet, existing solution methods lack either convergence guarantees or computational efficiency, due to the absence of smoothness and convexity. In this work, we bridge this gap by designing a first-order hypergradient-based algorithm for Stackelberg games and mathematically establishing its convergence using tools from nonsmooth analysis. To evaluate the \textit{hypergradient}, namely, the gradient of the upper-level objective, we develop an online scheme that simultaneously computes the lower-level equilibrium and its Jacobian. Crucially, this scheme exploits and preserves the original hierarchical and distributed structure of the problem, which renders it scalable and privacy-preserving. We numerically verify the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm on a large-scale hierarchical demand-response model.</description>

Abstract: Funnel control achieves output tracking with guaranteed tracking performance for unknown systems and arbitrary reference signals. In particular, the tracking error is guaranteed to satisfy time-varying error bounds for all times (it evolves in the funnel). However, convergence to zero cannot be guaranteed, but the error often stays close to the funnel boundary, inducing a comparatively large feedback gain. This has several disadvantages (e.g. poor tracking performance and sensitivity to noise due to the underlying high-gain feedback principle). In this paper, therefore, the usually known reference signal is taken into account during funnel controller design, i.e. we propose to combine the well-known internal model principle with funnel control. We focus on linear systems with linear reference internal models and show that under mild adjustments of funnel control, we can achieve asymptotic tracking for a whole class of linear systems (i.e. without relying on the knowledge of system parameters).</description>

      <title>A First Order Method for Linear Programming Parameterized by Circuit Imbalance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various first order approaches have been proposed in the literature to solve Linear Programming (LP) problems, recently leading to practically efficient solvers for large-scale LPs. From a theoretical perspective, linear convergence rates have been established for first order LP algorithms, despite the fact that the underlying formulations are not strongly convex. However, the convergence rate typically depends on the Hoffman constant of a large matrix that contains the constraint matrix, as well as the right hand side, cost, and capacity vectors.
  We introduce a first order approach for LP optimization with a convergence rate depending polynomially on the circuit imbalance measure, which is a geometric parameter of the constraint matrix, and depending logarithmically on the right hand side, capacity, and cost vectors. This provides much stronger convergence guarantees. For example, if the constraint matrix is totally unimodular, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms, whereas the convergence guarantees for approaches based on primal-dual formulations may have arbitrarily slow convergence rates for this class. Our approach is based on a fast gradient method due to Necoara, Nesterov, and Glineur (Math. Prog. 2019); this algorithm is called repeatedly in a framework that gradually fixes variables to the boundary. This technique is based on a new approximate version of Tardos's method, that was used to obtain a strongly polynomial algorithm for combinatorial LPs (Oper. Res. 1986).</description>

Abstract: This article concerns the performance limits of strictly causal state estimation for linear systems with fixed, but uncertain, parameters belonging to a finite set. In particular, we provide upper and lower bounds on the smallest achievable gain from disturbances to the point-wise estimation error. The bounds rely on forward and backward Riccati recursions -- one forward recursion for each feasible model and one backward recursion for each pair of feasible models. We give simple examples where the lower and upper bounds are tight.</description>

We present an episodic learning algorithm, where we for each episode use convex optimization to find a two-layer neural network approximation of the optimal $Q$-function. The convex optimization approach guarantees that the weights calculated at each episode are optimal, with respect to the given sampled states and actions of the current episode. For stable nonlinear systems, we show that the algorithm converges and that the converging parameters of the trained neural network can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal neural network parameters. In particular, if the regularization parameter is $\rho$ and the time horizon is $T$, then the parameters of the trained neural network converge to $w$, where the distance between $w$ from the optimal parameters $w^\star$ is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\rho T^{-1})$. That is, when the number of episodes goes to infinity, there exists a constant $C$ such that \[\|w-w^\star\| \le C\cdot\frac{\rho}{T}.\] In particular, our algorithm converges arbitrarily close to the optimal neural network parameters as the time horizon increases or as the regularization parameter decreases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider stochastic realization theory of Linear Switched Systems (LSS) with i.i.d. switching. We characterize minimality of stochastic LSSs and show existence and uniqueness (up to isomorphism) of minimal LSSs in innovation form. We present a realization algorithm to compute a minimal LSS in innovation form from output and input covariances. Finally, based on this realization algorithm, by replacing true covariances with empirical ones, we propose a statistically consistent system identification algorithm.</description>

      <title>Chattering Phenomena in Time-Optimal Control for High-Order Chain-of-Integrators Systems with Full State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for high-order chain-of-integrators systems with full state constraints and arbitrary given terminal states remains an open and challenging problem in optimal control theory domain. However, optimal control's behaviors in high-order problems lack of precision characterization, even where the existence of chattering phenomena remain unknown and overlooked. This paper establishes a theoretical framework of chattering phenomena in the problem, focusing on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound of switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this paper proves the existence of chattering phenomena in the problems. The chattering optimal control for 4th order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan strictly time-optimal snap-limited trajectories, while other cases of order $n\leq4$ are proved to not allow chattering. The conclusions correct the longstanding misconception in the industry regarding the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with minimal switching times.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Strict Cone Separation Theorems in Real Normed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive some new results for the separation of two not necessarily convex cones by a (convex) cone / conical surface in real (reflexive) normed spaces. In essence, we follow the nonlinear and nonsymmetric separation approach developed by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J. Optim. 20), which is based on augmented dual cones and Bishop-Phelps type (normlinear) separating functions. Compared to Kasimbeyli's separation theorem, we formulate our theorems for the separation of two cones under weaker conditions (concerning convexity and closedness requirements) with respect to the involved cones. By a new characterization of the algebraic interior of augmented dual cones in real normed spaces, we are able to establish relationships between our cone separation results and the results derived by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J. Optim. 20) and by Garcia-Castano, Melguizo-Padial and Parzanese (2023, Math. Meth. Oper. Res. 97).</description>

      <title>Accurate, scalable, and efficient Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design with derivative-informed neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider optimal experimental design (OED) problems in selecting the most informative observation sensors to estimate model parameters in a Bayesian framework. Such problems are computationally prohibitive when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is expensive to evaluate, the parameters are high-dimensional, and the optimization for sensor selection is combinatorial and high-dimensional. To address these challenges, we develop an accurate, scalable, and efficient computational framework based on derivative-informed neural operators (DINOs). The derivative of the PtO map is essential for accurate evaluation of the optimality criteria of OED in our consideration. We take the key advantage of DINOs, a class of neural operators trained with derivative information, to achieve high approximate accuracy of not only the PtO map but also, more importantly, its derivative. Moreover, we develop scalable and efficient computation of the optimality criteria based on DINOs and propose a modified swapping greedy algorithm for its optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed method is scalable to preserve the accuracy for increasing parameter dimensions and achieves high computational efficiency, with an over 1000x speedup accounting for both offline construction and online evaluation costs, compared to high-fidelity Bayesian OED solutions for a three-dimensional nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction example with tens of thousands of parameters.</description>

      <title>Designing a K-state P-bit Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based compute engines utilize the unique capability of a p-bit to probabilistically switch between two states to solve computationally challenging problems. However, when solving problems that require more than two states (e.g., problems such as Max-3-Cut, verifying if a graph is K-partite (K&gt;2) etc.), additional pre-processing steps such as graph reduction are required to make the problem compatible with a two-state p-bit platform. Moreover, this not only increases the problem size by entailing the use of auxiliary variables but can also degrade the solution quality. In this work, we develop a unique framework for implementing a K-state (K&gt;2) p-bit engine. Furthermore, from an implementation standpoint, we show that such a K-state p-bit engine can be implemented using N traditional (2-state) p-bits, and one multi-state p-bit -- a novel concept proposed here. Augmenting traditional p-bit platforms, our approach enables us to solve an archetypal combinatoric problem class requiring multiple states, namely Max-K-Cut (K=3, 4 shown here), without using any additional auxiliary variables. Thus, our work fundamentally advances the functional capability of p-bit engines, enabling them to solve a broader class of computationally challenging problems more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth Implicit Differentiation: Deterministic and Stochastic Convergence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently computing the derivative of the fixed-point of a parametric nondifferentiable contraction map. This problem has wide applications in machine learning, including hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning and data poisoning attacks. We analyze two popular approaches: iterative differentiation (ITD) and approximate implicit differentiation (AID). A key challenge behind the nonsmooth setting is that the chain rule does not hold anymore. Building upon the recent work by Bolte et al. (2022), who proved linear convergence of nondifferentiable ITD, we provide an improved linear rate for ITD and a slightly better rate for AID, both in the deterministic case. We further introduce NSID, a new stochastic method to compute the implicit derivative when the fixed point is defined as the composition of an outer map and an inner map which is accessible only through a stochastic unbiased estimator. We establish rates for the convergence of NSID, encompassing the best available rates in the smooth setting. We present illustrative experiments confirming our analysis.</description>

      <title>Sparse additive function decompositions facing basis transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional real-world systems can often be well characterized by a small number of simultaneous low-complexity interactions. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition and the anchored decomposition are typical techniques to find sparse additive decompositions of functions. In this paper, we are interested in a setting, where these decompositions are not directly spare, but become so after an appropriate basis transform. Noting that the sparsity of those additive function decompositions is equivalent to the fact that most of its mixed partial derivatives vanish, we can exploit a connection to the underlying function graphs to determine an orthogonal transform that realizes the appropriate basis change. This is done in three steps: we apply singular value decomposition to minimize the number of vertices of the function graph, and joint block diagonalization techniques of families of matrices followed by sparse minimization based on relaxations of the zero ''norm'' for minimizing the number of edges. For the latter one, we propose and analyze minimization techniques over the manifold of special orthogonal matrices. Various numerical examples illustrate the reliability of our approach for functions having, after a basis transform, a sparse additive decomposition into summands with at most two variables.</description>

      <title>LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since the first appearance of large language models (LLMs), yet their huge memory consumption has become a major roadblock to large-scale training. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem, but their performance still fails to match full parameter training in most large-scale fine-tuning settings. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an uncommon skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freeze most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over $11\%$-$37\%$ in terms of MT-Bench scores. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA achieves on-par or better performance than LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.</description>
