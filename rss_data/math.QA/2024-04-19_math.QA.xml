      <title>Line bundles on Contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$ via Conformal Block Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of stable curves of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points, $\overline{\rm{M}}_{g,n}$, is a central object in algebraic geometry, and plays a crucial role in $2$-dimensional conformal field theory. In this paper, we apply the sheaf of coinvariants and conformal block divisors to study the geometry of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$. The main theorem characterizes the line bundles on certain contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$ via F-curves, using Fakhruddin's basis for the Picard group given by conformal block divisors. This reveals a distinguished property of Knudsen's construction of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$. As a notable consequence of this property, using the global generation of sheaves of coinvariants by Fakhruddin, we refine Knudsen's construction by describing every possible contraction of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$ over it. An application of this refinement is given, and its potential for generalization is discussed.</description>

      <title>Weyl group twists and representations of quantum affine Borel algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define categories $\mathcal{O}^w$ of representations of Borel subalgebras $\mathcal{U}_q\mathfrak{b}$ of quantum affine algebras $\mathcal{U}_q\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$, which come from the category $\mathcal{O}$ twisted by Weyl group elements $w$. We construct inductive systems of finite-dimensional $\mathcal{U}_q\mathfrak{b}$-modules twisted by $w$, which provide representations in the category $\mathcal{O}^w$. We also establish a classification of simple modules in these categories $\mathcal{O}^w$.
  We explore convergent phenomenon of $q$-characters of representations of quantum affine algebras, which conjecturally give the $q$-characters of representations in $\mathcal{O}^w$.
  Furthermore, we propose a conjecture concerning the relationship between the category $\mathcal{O}$ and the twisted category $\mathcal{O}^w$, and we propose a possible connection with shifted quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>The Chern-Weil homomorphism for deformed Hopf-Galois extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the Chern-Weil map introduced by Hajac and Maszczyk associated with a Hopf-Galois extension in the case of $2$-cocycle deformation of the latter. We analyze the cases where the $2$-cocycle belongs to the structure Hopf algebra, an external symmetry, and the combined case. Moreover, we prove the naturality of the Chern-Weil map both in the deformed and not deformed case generalizing the classical result to the non-commutative case.</description>

      <title>Remote detectability from entanglement bootstrap I: Kirby's torus trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote detectability is often taken as a physical assumption in the study of topologically ordered systems, and it is a central axiom of mathematical frameworks of topological quantum field theories. We show under the entanglement bootstrap approach that remote detectability is a necessary property; that is, we derive it as a theorem. Starting from a single wave function on a topologically-trivial region satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, we can construct states on closed manifolds. The crucial technique is to immerse the punctured manifold into the topologically trivial region and then heal the puncture. This is analogous to Kirby's torus trick. We then analyze a special class of such manifolds, which we call pairing manifolds. For each pairing manifold, which pairs two classes of excitations, we identify an analog of the topological $S$-matrix. This pairing matrix is unitary, which implies remote detectability between two classes of excitations. These matrices are in general not associated with the mapping class group of the manifold. As a by-product, we can count excitation types (e.g., graph excitations in 3+1d). The pairing phenomenon occurs in many physical contexts, including systems in different dimensions, with or without gapped boundaries. We provide a variety of examples to illustrate its scope.</description>

      <title>The Hilb-vs-Quot Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be the complete local ring of a complex plane curve germ and $S$ its normalization. We propose a "Hilb-vs-Quot" conjecture relating the virtual weight polynomials of the Hilbert schemes of $R$ to those of the Quot schemes that parametrize $R$-submodules of $S$. By relating the Quot side to a type of compactified Picard scheme, we show that our conjecture generalizes a conjecture of Cherednik's, and that it would relate the perverse filtration on the cohomology of the Picard side to a more elementary filtration. Next, we propose a Quot version of the Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende conjecture, relating parabolic refinements of our Quot schemes to Khovanov-Rozansky link homology. It becomes equivalent to the original version under (refined) Hilb-vs-Quot, but can also be strengthened to incorporate polynomial actions and $y$-ification. For germs $y^n = x^d$, where $n$ is either coprime to or divides $d$, we prove the Quot version of ORS through combinatorics. When $n = 3$ and $3 \nmid d$, we deduce Hilb-vs-Quot by an asymptotic argument, and hence, establish the original ORS conjecture for these germs.</description>

      <title>Averaging multipliers on locally compact quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an averaging procedure for completely bounded multipliers on a locally compact quantum group with respect to a compact quantum subgroup. As a consequence we show that central approximation properties of discrete quantum groups are equivalent to the corresponding approximation properties of their Drinfeld doubles. This is complemented by a discussion of the averaging of Fourier algebra elements. We compare the biinvariant Fourier algebra of the Drinfeld double of a discrete quantum group with the central Fourier algebra. In the unimodular case these are naturally identified, but we show by exhibiting a family of counter-examples that they differ in general.</description>
