      <title>An Algebraic Proof of Hrushovski's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his paper on the Mordell-Lang conjecture, Hrushovski employed techniques from model theory to prove the function field version of the conjecture. In doing so he was able to answer a related question of Voloch, which we refer to henceforth as Hrushovski's theorem. In this paper we shall give an alternative proof of said theorem in the characteristic $p$ setting, but using purely algebro-geometric ideas.</description>

      <title>Notes on $2D$ $\mathbb F_p$-Selberg integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a two-dimensional $\mathbb F_p$-Selberg integral formula, in which the two-dimensional $\mathbb F_p$-Selberg integral $\bar S(a,b,c;l_1,l_2)$ depends on positive integer parameters $a,b,c$, $l_1,l_2$ and is an element of the finite field $\mathbb F_p$ with odd prime number $p$ of elements. The formula is motivated by the analogy between multidimensional hypergeometric solutions of the KZ equations and polynomial solutions of the same equations reduced modulo $p$.</description>

      <title>Cubic fourfolds with symplectic automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine projective equations of smooth complex cubic fourfolds with symplectic automorphisms by classifying 6-dimensional projective representations of Laza and Zheng's 34 groups. In particular, we determine the number of irreducible components for moduli spaces of cubic fourfolds with symplectic actions by these groups. We also discuss the fields of definition of cubic fourfolds in six maximal cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for a Brauer-Severi surface bundle over a rational 3-fold to not be stably rational. Additionally, we present an example that satisfies this condition and demonstrate the existence of families of Brauer-Severi surface bundles whose general members are smooth and not stably rational.</description>

      <title>On retract rationality for finite connected group schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we prove the retract rationality of the classifying spaces $BG$ for several types of finite connected group schemes $G$ over algebraically closed fields $k$ of positive characteristic $p&gt;0$. In particular, we prove the retract rationality for the finite simple group schemes $G$ associated with the generalized Witt algebras in specific cases. To this end, we study the automorphism group schemes of the generalized Witt algebras and establish triangulations for them. Moreover, we extend the notion of Witt--Ree algebra to general base rings and discuss their properties.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph associahedra and compactifications of moduli spaces of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every Hassett compactification of the moduli space of weighted stable rational curves that admits both a reduction map from the Losev-Manin compactification and a reduction map to projective space is a toric variety, whose corresponding polytope is a hypergraph associahedron (also known as a nestohedron). In addition, we present an analogous result for the moduli space of labeled weighted points in affine space up to translation and scaling. These results are interconnected, and we make their relationship explicit through the concept of ``inflation" of a hypergraph associahedron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper performs the following steps toward the proof of GLC in the de Rham setting:
  (i) We deduce GLC for G=GL_n;
  (ii) We prove that the Langlands functor L_G constructed in [GLC1], when restricted to the cuspidal category, is ambidextrous;
  (iii) We reduce GLC to the study of a certain classical vector bundle with connection on the stack of irreducible local systems;
  (iv) We prove that GLC is equivalent to the contractibility of the space of generic oper structures on irreducible local systems;
  (v) Using [BKS], we deduce GLC for classical groups.</description>

Abstract: We define a class of skeletons on Berkovich analytic spaces, which we call "accessible", which contains the standard skeleton of the n-dimensional torus for every n and is preserved by G-glueing, by taking the inverse image along a morphism of relative dimension zero, and by taking the direct image along a morphism whose restriction to the involved skeleton is topologically proper.</description>

      <title>A stacky $p$-adic Riemann--Hilbert correspondence on Hitchin-small locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be an algebraically closed perfectoid field over $\Qp$ with the ring of integer $\calO_C$ and the infinitesimal thickening $\Ainf$. Let $\frakX$ be a smooth formal scheme over $\calO_C$ with a fixed smooth lifting $\wtx$ over $\Ainf$. Let $X$ be the generic fiber of $\frakX$ and $\wtX$ be its lifting over $\BdRp$ induced by $\wtx$. Let $\MIC_r(\wtX)^{{\rm H-small}}$ and $\rL\rS_r(X,\BBdRp)^{{\rm H-small}}$ be the $v$-stacks of rank-$r$ Hitchin-small integrable connections on $\wtX_{\et}$ and $\BBdRp$-local systems on $X_{v}$, respectively. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between this two stacks by introducing a new period sheaf with connection $(\calO\bB_{\dR,\pd}^+,\rd)$ on $X_{v}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce tools for transferring nonnegativity certificates for global sections between line bundles on real algebraic surfaces. As applications, we improve Hilbert's degree bounds on sum-of-squares multipliers for nonnegative ternary forms, give a complete characterization of nonnegative real forms of del Pezzo surfaces, and establish quadratic upper bounds for the degrees of sum-of-squares multipliers for nonnegative forms on real ruled surfaces.</description>

      <title>Faber--Pandharipande Cycles vanish for Shimura curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of Green and Griffiths states that for the generic curve $C$ of genus $g \geq 4$ with the canonical divisor $K$, its Faber--Pandharipande 0-cycle $K\times K-(2g-2)K_\Delta$ on $C\times C$ is nontorsion in the Chow group of rational equivalence classes. For Shimura curves, however, we show that their Faber--Pandharipande 0-cycles are rationally equivalent to 0. This is predicted by a conjecture of Beilinson and Bloch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an abelian surface $A$, we consider stable vector bundles on a generalized Kummer variety $K_n(A)$ with $n&gt;1$. We prove that the connected component of the moduli space which contains the tautological bundles associated to line bundles of degree $0$ is isomorphic to the blowup of the dual abelian surface in one point. We believe that this is the first explicit example of a component which is smooth with a non-trivial canonical bundle.</description>

      <title>Eventual tightness of projective dimension growth bounds: quadratic in the degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In projective dimension growth results, one bounds the number of rational points of height at most $H$ on an irreducible hypersurface in $\mathbb P^n$ of degree $d&gt;3$ by $C(n)d^2 H^{n-1}(\log H)^{M(n)}$, where the quadratic dependence in $d$ has been recently obtained by Binyamini, Cluckers and Kato in 2024 [1]. For these bounds, it was already shown by Castryck, Cluckers, Dittmann and Nguyen in 2020 [3] that one cannot do better than a linear dependence in $d$. In this paper we show that, for the mentioned projective dimension growth bounds, the quadratic dependence in $d$ is eventually tight when $n$ grows. More precisely the upper bounds cannot be better than $c(n)d^{2-2/n} H^{n-1}$ in general. Note that for affine dimension growth (for affine hypersurfaces of degree $d$, satisfying some extra conditions), the dependence on $d$ is also quadratic by [1], which is already known to be optimal by [3]. Our projective case thus complements the picture of tightness for dimension growth bounds for hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties over finite fields with commutative endomorphism algebra: theory and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a categorical description of all abelian varieties with commutative endomorphism ring over a finite field with $q=p^a$ elements in a fixed isogeny class in terms of pairs consisting of a fractional $\mathbb Z[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal and a fractional $W\otimes_{\mathbb Z_p} \mathbb Z_p[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal, with $\pi$ the Frobenius endomorphism and $W$ the ring of integers in an unramified extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ of degree $a$. The latter ideal should be compatible at $p$ with the former and stable under the action of a semilinear Frobenius (and Verschiebung) operator; it will be the Dieudonn\'e module of the corresponding abelian variety. Using this categorical description we create effective algorithms to compute isomorphism classes of these objects and we produce many new examples exhibiting exotic patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X\subset \mathbb P^d$ be a $m$-dimensional variety in $d$-dimensional projective space. Let $k$ be a positive integer such that $\binom{m+k}k \le d$. Consider the following interpolation problem: does there exist a variety $Y\subset \mathbb P^d$ of dimension $\le \binom{m+k}k -1$, with $X\subset Y$, such that the tangent space to $Y$ at a point $p\in X$ is equal to the $k$th osculating space to $X$ at $p$, for almost all points $p\in X$? In this paper we consider this question in the toric setting. We prove that if $X$ is toric, then there is a unique toric variety $Y$ solving the above interpolation problem. We identify $Y$ in the general case and we explicitly compute some of its invariants when $X$ is a toric curve.</description>

      <title>Isotrivial Lagrangian fibrations of compact hyper-K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article initiates the study of isotrivial Lagrangian fibrations of compact hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. We present four foundational results that extend well-known facts about isotrivial elliptic fibrations of K3 surfaces. First, we prove that smooth fibers of an isotrivial Lagrangian fibration are isogenous to a power of an elliptic curve. Second, we exhibit a dichotomy between two types of isotrivial Lagrangian fibrations, which we call A and B. Third, we give a classification result for type A isotrivial Lagrangian fibrations. Namely, if a type A isotrivial Lagrangian fibration admits a rational section, then it is birational to one of two straightforward examples of isotrivial fibrations of hyper-K\"ahler manifolds of $\text{K3}^{[n]}$-type and $\text{Kum}_n$-type. Finally, we prove that a genericity assumption on the smooth fiber of an isotrivial Lagrangian fibration ensures that the fibration is of type A.</description>

  (1) Formulate and prove the Fundamental Local Equivalence (FLE) at the critical level;
  (2) Study the interaction between Kac-Moody localization and the global geometric Langlands functor of ref. [GLC1].
  This paper contains an extensive Appendix, whose primary goals are:
  (a) Development the theory of ind-coherent sheaves in infinite type;
  (b)Development of the formalism of factorization categories.</description>

Abstract: In a seminal work, Bessis gave a geometric interpretation of the noncrossing lattice $NC(W)$ associated to a well-generated complex reflection group $W$. Chief component of this was the trivialization theorem, a fundamental correspondence between families of chains of $NC(W)$ and the fibers of a finite quasi-homogeneous morphism, the $LL$ map.
  We consider a variant of the $LL$ map, prescribed by the trivialization theorem, and apply it to the study of finer enumerative and structural properties of $NC(W)$. In particular, we extend work of Bessis and Ripoll and enumerate the so-called "primitive factorizations" of the Coxeter element $c$. That is, length additive factorizations of the form $c=w\cdot t_1\cdots t_k$, where $w$ belongs to a given conjugacy class and the $t_i$'s are reflections.</description>

      <title>Complete verification of strong BSD for many modular abelian surfaces over $\mathbf{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory and algorithms necessary to be able to verify the strong Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture for absolutely simple modular abelian varieties over $\mathbf{Q}$. We apply our methods to all 28 Atkin--Lehner quotients of $X_0(N)$ of genus $2$, all 97 genus $2$ curves from the LMFDB whose Jacobian is of this type and six further curves originally found by Wang. We are able to verify the strong BSD Conjecture unconditionally and exactly in all these cases; this is the first time that strong BSD has been confirmed for absolutely simple abelian varieties of dimension at least $2$. We also give an example where we verify that the order of the Tate--Shafarevich group is $7^2$ and agrees with the order predicted by the BSD Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Finding all solutions to the KZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>

Abstract: The KZ equations are differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the $n$-point functions of affine primary fields. In [SV1] the KZ equations were identified with equations for flat sections of suitable Gauss-Manin connections, and solutions of the KZ equations were constructed in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In [SV2] the KZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$, and, for rational levels, polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ were constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we study in detail the first nontrivial example of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$. In particular, if the level is irrational, we prove a version of the steepest descent result that relates the KZ local system to the space of functions on the critical locus of the master function. We use this result to prove the generic irreducibility of the KZ local system at any irrational level. If the level is rational, we describe all solutions of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Finally, we prove a Lagrangian property of the subbundle of the KZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections.</description>
