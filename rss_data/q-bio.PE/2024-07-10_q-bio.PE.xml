      <title>The Path-Label Reconciliation (PLR) Dissimilarity Measure for Gene Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of comparing gene trees reconciled with the same species tree using a novel semi-metric, called the Path-Label Reconciliation (PLR) dissimilarity measure. This approach not only quantifies differences in the topology of reconciled gene trees, but also considers discrepancies in predicted ancestral gene-species maps and speciation/duplication events, offering a refinement of existing metrics such as Robinson-Foulds (RF) and their labeled extensions LRF and ELRF. A tunable parameter {\alpha} also allows users to adjust the balance between its species map and event labeling components. We show that PLR can be computed in linear time and that it is a semi-metric. We also discuss the diameters of reconciled gene tree measures, which are important in practice for normalization, and provide initial bounds on PLR, LRF, and ELRF. To validate PLR, we simulate reconciliations and perform comparisons with LRF and ELRF. The results show that PLR provides a more evenly distributed range of distances, making it less susceptible to overestimating differences in the presence of small topological changes, while at the same time being computationally efficient. Our findings suggest that the theoretical diameter is rarely reached in practice. The PLR measure advances phylogenetic reconciliation by combining theoretical rigor with practical applicability. Future research will refine its mathematical properties, explore its performance on different tree types, and integrate it with existing bioinformatics tools for large-scale evolutionary analyses. The open source code is available at: https://pypi.org/project/parle/.</description>

      <title>Quantifying "just-right" APC inactivation for colorectal cancer initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dysregulation of the tumour suppressor gene Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) is a canonical step in colorectal cancer development. Curiously, most colorectal tumours carry biallelic mutations that result in only partial loss of APC function, suggesting that a "just-right" level of APC inactivation, and hence Wnt signalling, provides the optimal conditions for tumorigenesis. Mutational processes act variably across the APC gene, which could contribute to the bias against complete APC inactivation. Thus the selective consequences of partial APC loss are unclear. Here we propose a mathematical model to quantify the tumorigenic effect of biallelic APC genotypes, controlling for somatic mutational processes. Analysing sequence data from &gt;2500 colorectal cancers, we find that APC genotypes resulting in partial protein function confer about 50 times higher probability of progressing to cancer compared to complete APC inactivation. The optimal inactivation level varies with anatomical location and additional mutations of Wnt pathway regulators. We use this context dependency to assess the regulatory effect of secondary Wnt drivers in combination with APC in vivo, and provide evidence that mutant AMER1 combines with APC genotypes that lead to relatively low Wnt. The fitness landscape of APC inactivation is consistent across microsatellite unstable and POLE-deficient colorectal cancers and tumours in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, suggesting a general "just-right" optimum, and pointing to Wnt hyperactivation as a potential cancer vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics under demographic and environmental stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the study of the long term dynamics of diffusion processes modelling a single species that experiences both demographic and environmental stochasticity. In our setting, the long term dynamics of the diffusion process in the absence of demographic stochasticity is determined by the sign of $\Lambda_0$, the external Lyapunov exponent, as follows: $\Lambda_0&lt;0$ implies (asymptotic) extinction and $\Lambda_0&gt;0$ implies convergence to a unique positive stationary distribution $\mu_0$. If the system is of size $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ for small $\epsilon&gt;0$ (the intensity of demographic stochasticity), demographic effects will make the extinction time finite almost surely. This suggests that to understand the dynamics one should analyze the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) $\mu_\epsilon$ of the system. The existence and uniqueness of the QSD is well-known under mild assumptions.
  We look at what happens when the population size is sent to infinity, i.e., when $\epsilon\to 0$. We show that the external Lyapunov exponent still plays a key role: 1) If $\Lambda_0&lt;0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \delta_0$, the mean extinction time is of order $|\ln \epsilon|$ and the extinction rate associated with the QSD $\mu_{\epsilon}$ has a lower bound of order $\frac{1}{|\ln\epsilon|}$; 2) If $\Lambda_0&gt;0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \mu_0$, the mean extinction time is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ and the extinction rate is polynomial in $\epsilon^{2}$. Furthermore, when $\Lambda_0&gt;0$ we are able to show that the system exhibits multiscale dynamics: at first the process quickly approaches the QSD $\mu_\epsilon$ and then, after spending a polynomially long time there, it relaxes to the extinction state. We give sharp asymptotics in $\epsilon$ for the time spent close to $\mu_\epsilon$.</description>
