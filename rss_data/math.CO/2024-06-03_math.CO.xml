      <title>Landscapes of the Octahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscapes of a polyhedron are subsets of its nets one must consider to identify all shortest paths. Landscapes of cubes and tetrahedra have been used to identify coordinate based formulas for the lengths of the shortest paths between points on these surfaces. We extend these results to develop formulas for the lengths of the shortest paths between points on the surface of octahedra.</description>

      <title>Sphere packing proper colorings of an expander graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of error-correcting codes on $[q]^n$ where a code is a set of proper $q$-colorings of some fixed $n$-vertex graph $G$. For a pair of proper $q$-colorings $X, Y$ of $G$, we define their distance as the minimum Hamming distance between $X$ and $\sigma(Y)$ over all $\sigma \in S_q$. We then say that a set of proper $q$-colorings of $G$ is $\delta$-distinct if any pair of colorings in the set have distance at least $\delta n$.
  We investigate how one-sided spectral expansion relates to the largest possible set of $\delta$-distinct colorings on a graph. For fixed $(\delta, \lambda) \in [0, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ and positive integer $d$, let $f_{\delta, \lambda, d}(n)$ denote the maximal size of a set of $\delta$-distinct colorings of any $d$-regular graph on at most $n$ vertices with normalized second eigenvalue at most $\lambda$. We study the growth of $f$ as $n$ goes to infinity. We partially characterize regimes of $(\delta, \lambda)$ where $f$ grows exponentially, is finite, and is at most $1$, respectively. We also prove several sharp phase transitions between these regimes.</description>

      <title>Monomial identities in the Weyl algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question and some enumerative conjectures of Richard Stanley, we explore the equivalence classes of words in the Weyl algebra, $\mathbf{k} \langle D,U\rangle/(DU-UD=1)$. We show that each class is generated by the swapping of adjacent *balanced subwords*, i.e., those which have the same number of $D$'s as $U$'s, and give several other characterizations.
  Armed with this we deduce a number of enumerative results about the number of such equivalence classes and their sizes. We extend these results to the class of $c$-Dyck words, where every prefix has at least $c$ times as many $U$'s as $D$'s. We also connect these results to previous work on bond percolation and rook theory, and generalize them to some other algebras.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of intersection graphs of $x$-monotone curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A curve in the plane is $x$-monotone if every vertical line intersects it at most once. A family of curves are called pseudo-segments if every pair of them have at most one point in common. We construct $2^{\Omega(n^{4/3})}$ families, each consisting of $n$ labelled $x$-monotone pseudo-segments such that their intersection graphs are different. On the other hand, we show that the number of such intersection graphs is at most $2^{O(n^{3/2-\varepsilon})}$, where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a suitable constant. Our proof uses a new upper bound on the number of set systems of size $m$ on a ground set of size $n$, with VC-dimension at most $d$. Much better upper bounds are obtained if we only count bipartite intersection graphs, or, in general, intersection graphs with bounded chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Long cycles and spectral radii in planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a rich history of studying the existence of cycles in planar graphs. The famous Tutte theorem on the Hamilton cycle states that every 4-connected planar graph contains a Hamilton cycle. Later on, Thomassen (1983), Thomas and Yu (1994) and Sanders (1996) respectively proved that every 4-connected planar graph contains a cycle of length $n-1, n-2$ and $n-3$. Chen, Fan and Yu (2004) further conjectured that every 4-connected planar graph contains a cycle of length $\ell$ for $\ell\in\{n,n-1,\ldots,n-25\}$ and they verified that $\ell\in \{n-4, n-5, n-6\}$. When we remove the ``4-connected" condition, how to guarantee the existence of a long cycle in a planar graph? A natural question asks by adding a spectral radius condition: What is the smallest constant $C$ such that for sufficiently large $n$, every graph $G$ of order $n$ with spectral radius greater than $C$ contains a long cycle in a planar graph? In this paper, we give a stronger answer to the above question. Let $G$ be a planar graph with order $n\geq 1.8\times 10^{17}$ and $k\leq \lfloor\log_2(n-3)\rfloor-8$ be a non-negative integer, we show that if $\rho(G)\geq \rho(K_2\vee(P_{n-2k-4}\cup 2P_{k+1}))$ then $G$ contains a cycle of length $\ell$ for every $\ell\in \{n-k, n-k-1, \ldots, 3\}$ unless $G\cong K_2\vee(P_{n-2k-4}\cup 2P_{k+1})$.</description>

      <title>Properties of regular Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Tangle is a smooth simple closed curve formed from arcs (or ``links'') of circles with fixed radius. Most previous study of Tangles has dealt with the case where these arcs are quarter-circles, but Tangles comprised of thirds and sixths of circles are introduced. Together, these three families of Tangles are related to the three regular tilings of the plane by squares, regular hexagons, and equilateral triangles. This relationship is harnessed to prove results about the number of links comprising a Tangle and the area that it encloses.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma_4$ be the graph whose vertices are the chambers of the finite projective $4$-space PG(4,q), with two vertices being adjacent if the corresponding chambers are in general position. For $q\geq 749 $ we show that $\alpha:=(q^2+q+1)(q^3+2q^2+q+1)(q+1)^2$ is the independence number of $\Gamma_4$ and the geometric structure of independent sets with $\alpha$ vertices is described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every simple finite graph $G$ has an associated Lov\'asz-Saks-Schrijver ring $R_G(d)$ that is related to the $d$-dimensional orthogonal representations of $G$. The study of $R_G(d)$ lies at the intersection between algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and combinatorics. We find a link between algebraic properties such as normality, factoriality and strong $F$-regularity of $R_G(d)$ and combinatorial invariants of the graph $G$. In particular we prove that if $d \geq \text{pmd}(G)+k(G)$ then $R_G(d)$ is $F$-regular in finite characteristic and rational singularity in characteristic $0$ and furthermore if $d \geq \text{pmd}(G)+k(G)+1$ then $R_G(d)$ is UFD. Here $\text{pmd}(G)$ is the positive matching decomposition number of $G$ and $k(G)$ is its degeneracy number.</description>

      <title>Practical implementation of geometric quasi-cyclic LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail for the first time a complete explicit description of the quasi-cyclic structure of all classical finite generalized quadrangles. Using these descriptions we construct families of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes derived from the point-line incidence matrix of the quadrangles by explicitly calculating quasi-cyclic generator and parity check matrices for these codes. This allows us to construct parity check and generator matrices of all such codes of length up to 400000. These codes cover a wide range of transmission rates, are easy and fast to implement and perform close to Shannon's limit with no visible error floors. We also include some performance data for these codes. Furthermore, we include a complete explicit description of the quasi-cyclic structure of the point-line and point-hyperplane incidences of the finite projective and affine spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitch Cheney's 5-card trick was introduced in 1950. In 2013, Mulcahy invented a 4-card trick in which the cards are allowed to be displayed face down. We suggest our own invention: a 3-card trick in which the cards can be face down and also allowed to be placed both vertically and horizontally. We discuss the theory behind all the tricks and estimate the maximum deck size given the number of chosen cards. We also discuss the cases of hiding several cards and the deck that has duplicates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph matching aims to find correspondences between two graphs. It is a fundamental task in pattern recognition. The classical spectral matching algorithm has time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ and space complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Such a complexity limits the applicability to large-scale graph matching tasks. This paper proposes an efficient redesign of spectral matching by transforming the graph matching problem into a 1D linear assignment problem, which can be solved efficiently by sorting two $n \times 1$ vectors. The resulting algorithm is named the lightning spectral assignment method (LiSA), which enjoys a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and the theoretical analysis of the strategy.</description>

      <title>On the interval coloring impropriety of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An improper interval (edge) coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to the edges of $G$ satisfying the condition that, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, the set of colors assigned to the edges incident with $v$ forms an integral interval. An interval coloring is $k$-improper if at most $k$ edges with the same color all share a common endpoint. The minimum integer $k$ such that there exists a $k$-improper interval coloring of the graph $G$ is the interval coloring impropriety of $G$, denoted by $\mu_{int}(G)$. In this paper, we provide a construction of an interval coloring of a subclass of complete multipartite graphs. This provides additional evidence to the conjecture by Casselgren and Petrosyan that $\mu_{int}(G)\leq 2$ for all complete multipartite graphs $G$. Additionally, we determine improved upper bounds on the interval coloring impropriety of several classes of graphs, namely 2-trees, iterated triangulations, and outerplanar graphs. Finally, we investigate the interval coloring impropriety of the corona product of two graphs, $G\odot H$.</description>

Abstract: For integers $k\geq 1$ and $n\geq 2k+1$, the Schrijver graph $S(n,k)$ has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that contain no two cyclically adjacent elements, and an edge between any two disjoint sets. More generally, for integers $k\geq 1$, $s\geq 2$, and $n \geq sk+1$, the $s$-stable Kneser graph $S(n,k,s)$ has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ in which any two elements are in cyclical distance at least $s$. We prove that all the graphs $S(n,k,s)$, in particular Schrijver graphs $S(n,k)=S(n,k,2)$, admit a Hamilton cycle that can be computed in time $\mathcal{O}(n)$ per generated vertex.</description>

      <title>A census of graph-drawing algorithms based on generalized transversal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two graph drawing algorithms based on the recently defined "grand-Schnyder woods", which are a far-reaching generalization of the classical Schnyder woods. The first is a straight-line drawing algorithm for plane graphs with faces of degree 3 and 4 with no separating 3-cycle, while the second is a rectangular drawing algorithm for the dual of such plane graphs.
  In our algorithms, the coordinates of the vertices are defined in a global manner, based on the underlying grand-Schnyder woods. The grand-Schnyder woods and drawings are computed in linear time.
  When specializing our algorithms to special classes of plane graphs, we recover the following known algorithms: (1) He's algorithm for rectangular drawing of 3-valent plane graphs, based on transversal structures, (2) Fusy's algorithm for the straight-line drawing of triangulations of the square, based on transversal structures, (3) Bernardi and Fusy's algorithm for the orthogonal drawing of 4-valent plane graphs, based on 2-orientations, (4) Barriere and Huemer's algorithm for the straight-line drawing of quadrangulations, based on separating decompositions. 
  Our contributions therefore provide a unifying perspective on a large family of graph drawing algorithms that were originally defined on different classes of plane graphs and were based on seemingly different combinatorial structures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we apply the tools developed in [4] in order to present some consequences of the study of UMP algebras and the ramifications graph of a monomial bound quiver algebra. In particular, we prove that every weakly connected component of the ramifications graph of a UMP monomial algebra is unilaterally connected. Furthermore, we use this characterization to show that, in the case of quadratic monomial algebras, the class of UMP algebras coincides with the class of special multiserial algebras.</description>

      <title>Tournaments and random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between tournaments and random walks. This connection was first observed by Erd\H{o}s and Moser. Winston and Kleitman came close to showing that $S_n=\Theta(4^n/n^{5/2})$. Building on this, and works by Tak\'acs, these asymptotic bounds were confirmed by Kim and Pittel.
  In this work, we verify Moser's conjecture that $S_n\sim C4^n/n^{5/2}$, using limit theory for integrated random walk bridges. Moreover, we show that $C$ can be described in terms of random walks. Combining this with a recent proof and number-theoretic description of $C$ by the second author, we obtain an analogue of Louchard's formula, for the Laplace transform of the squared Brownian excursion/Airy area measure. Finally, we describe the scaling limit of random score sequences, in terms of the Kolmogorov excursions, studied recently by B\"{a}r, Duraj and Wachtel.
  Our results can also be interpreted as answering questions related to a class of random polymers, which began with influential work of Sina\u{i}. From this point of view, our methods yield the precise asymptotics of a persistence probability, related to the pinning/wetting models from statistical physics, that was estimated up to constants by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, as conjectured by Caravenna and Deuschel.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Sina\u{i} excursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of random polymers, introduced by Sina\u{i}, which are related to persistence probabilities in integrated simple random walk bridges. We find the precise asymptotics of these probabilities, and describe their combinatorics, using limit theory for infinitely divisible distributions, and the number-theoretic subset counting formulas of von Sterneck from the early 1900s. Our results sharpen estimates by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, and respond to a conjecture of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the pinning/wetting models, for random linear chains exhibiting entropic repulsion. Our key combinatorial result is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula.</description>

      <title>Framization and Deframization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the geometric construction of the framed braid group, we define and study the framization of several Brauer-type monoids and also the set partition monoid, all of which appear in knot theory. We introduce the concept of deframization, which is a procedure to obtain a tied monoid from a given framed monoid. Furthermore, we show in detail how this procedure works on the monoids mentioned above. We also discuss the framization and deframization of some algebras, which are deformations, respectively, of the framized and deframized monoids discussed here.</description>
