      <title>On the chain of commuting operators on Banach spaces and Lomonosov's invariant subspace theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An operator $T$ on a Banach space is said to be of chain $N$ if there exist non-scalar operators $S_1,...,S_{N-1}$ and a non-zero compact $K$ such that $$T \leftrightarrow S_1 \leftrightarrow S_2 \leftrightarrow ...\leftrightarrow S_{N-1} \leftrightarrow K,$$ where $A\leftrightarrow B$ means $AB=BA$. A connection of this theory to the Lomonosov's Invariant Subspace Theorem is highlighted. It is shown that for every weighted shift $T$ it is of chain $3$. In particular, every non-Lomonosov operator from from the work of Hadwin et al. is of chain $3$. An example of an operator on a separable Hilbert space is given, such that it fails to be connected to a compact operator via a chain of any length.</description>

      <title>Product of nonnegative selfadjoint operators in unbounded settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions are established for the factorization of a closed, in general, unbounded operator $T=AB$ into a product of two nonnegative selfadjoint operators $A$ and $B.$ Already the special case, where $A$ or $B$ is bounded, leads to new results and is of wider interest, since the problem is connected to the notion of similarity of the operator $T$ to a selfadjoint one, but, in fact, goes beyond this case. It is proved that this subclass of operators can be characterized not only by means of quasi-affinity of $T^*$ to an operator $S=S^* \geq 0$, but also via Sebesty\'en inequality, a result known in the setting of bounded operators $T.$ Another subclass of operators $T,$ where $A$ or $B$ has a bounded inverse, leads to a similar analysis. This gives rise to a reversed version of Sebesty\'en inequality which is introduced in the present paper. It is shown that this second subclass, where $A^{-1}$ or $B^{-1}$ is bounded, can be characterized in a similar way by means of quasi-affinity of $T,$ rather that $T^*,$ to an operator $S=S^*\geq 0$. Furthermore, the connection between these two classes and weak-similarity as well as quasi-similarity to some $S=S^*\geq 0$ is investigated. Finally, the special case where $ S$ is bounded is considered.</description>

      <title>Operators associated with the hexablock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hexablock is a domain arising from a special case of the $\mu$-synthesis problem. We study the commuting operator tuples having the hexablock as a spectral set. Such a tuple is called a hexablock-contraction or simply $\mathbb H$-contraction. We characterize the unitaries and isometries associated with $\mathbb H$-contractions. Two different types of dilation results for $\mathbb H$-contractions are obtained. We find connection of this theory with the operators associated with the symmetrized bidisc and tetrablock, two other domains related to the $\mu$-synthesis problem.</description>

      <title>BGD domains in p.c.f. self-similar sets II: spectral asymptotics for Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a p.c.f. self-similar set equipped with a strongly recurrent Dirichlet form. Under a homogeneity assumption, for an open set $\Omega\subset K$ whose boundary $\partial \Omega$ is a graph-directed self-similar set, we prove that the eigenvalue counting function $\rho^\Omega(x)$ of the Laplacian with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions (Neumann only for connected $\Omega$) has an explicit second term as $x\to +\infty$, beyond the dominant Weyl term. If $\partial\Omega$ has a strong iterated structure, we establish that \begin{equation*} \rho^\Omega(x)=\nu(\Omega)G\Big(\frac{\log x}2\Big)x^{\frac{d_S}2}+\kappa(\partial\Omega)G_1\Big(\frac{\log x}2\Big)x^{\frac d2}+o\big(x^{\frac d2}\big), \end{equation*} where $G$ and $G_1$ are bounded periodic functions, $\nu$ and $\kappa$ are certain reference measures, and $d_S$ and $d$ are dimension-related parameters.</description>

      <title>Sharp perturbation bounds on the Frobenius norm of subunitary and positive polar factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging tools from convex analysis and incorporating additional singular value information of matrices, we completely resolve the problem of establishing perturbation bounds for the Frobenius norm of subunitary and positive polar factors. We derive corresponding sharp upper and lower bounds. As corollaries, we refine the results of Li and Sun [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 23 (2002), pp. 1183--1193] and strengthen the classical Araki-Yamagami inequality [Comm. Math. Phys., 81 (1981), no. 1, pp. 89--96]. The versatility of our method also allows us to strengthen Lee's conjecture, providing a sharper version along with a matching sharp lower bound. Furthermore, we generalize the classical matrix arithmetic-geometric mean inequality and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality into tighter and more robust forms. Finally, we establish a sharp lower bound for a result by Kittaneh [Comm. Math. Phys., 104 (1986), no. 2, pp. 307--310].</description>

      <title>On Strongly Convex Sets and Farthest Distance Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polarity notion for sets in a Banach space is introduced in such a way that the second polar of a set coincides with the smallest strongly convex set with respect to R that contains it. Strongly convex sets are characterized in terms of their associated farthest distance functions, and farthest distance functions associated with strongly convex sets are characterized, too.</description>

      <title>Schatten-von Neumann classes of tensors of invariant operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study Schatten-von Neumann classes of tensor products of invariant operators on Hilbert spaces. In the first part we first deduce some spectral properties for tensors of anharmonic oscillators thanks to the knowledge on corresponding Schatten-von Neumann properties. In the second part we specialised on tensors of invariant operators. In the special case where a suitable Fourier analysis associated to a fixed partition of a Hilbert space into finite dimensional subspaces is available we also give the corresponding formulae in terms of symbols. We also give a sufficient condition for Dixmier traceability for a class of finite tensors of pseudo-differential operators on the flat torus.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness in asymptotic $L_p$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness theorem to the setting of asymptotic $L_p$ spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$. These are nonlocally convex $\mathrm{F}$-spaces that contain the standard $L_p$ spaces as dense subspaces and include all measurable functions supported on sets of finite measure. As an application of our main result, we deduce a well-known characterization of relatively compact families of measurable functions in terms of almost equiboundedness and almost equicontinuity. We conclude with illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>On a dense set of functions determined by sampled Gabor magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of recovering a function from the magnitude of its Gabor transform sampled on a discrete set. While it is known that uniqueness fails for general square integrable functions, we show that phase retrieval is possible for a dense class of signals: specifically, those whose Bargmann transforms are entire functions of exponential type. Our main result characterises when such functions can be uniquely recovered (up to a global phase) from magnitude only data sampled on uniformly discrete sets of sufficient lower Beurling density. In particular, we prove that every entire function of exponential type is uniquely determined (up to a global phase) among all second order entire functions by its modulus on a sufficiently dense shifted lattice.</description>

      <title>Affine AP-frames and Stationary Random Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that, in general, an affine or Gabor AP-frame is an $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-frame and conversely. In part as a consequence of the Ergodic Theorem, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for an affine (wavelet) system $\mathcal{A}=\{a^{j/2} \psi_{j,k}(t):=a^{-j/2} \psi (a^{-j} t -k) :j\in\mathbb{Z}, k\in\mathbb{K}:=b\mathbb{Z}\}$ to be an affine AP-Frame in terms of Gaussian stationary random processes expanding in this way what we have done recently for Gabor systems. Likewise, we study a connection between the decay of the associated stationary sequences $\{\langle{X,\psi_{j,k}}\rangle : k\in\mathbb{K}\}$ for each $j\in\mathbb{Z}$, and a smoothness condition on a Gaussian stationary random process $X=(X(t))_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell bounds via parallel coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any log-concave random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with mean zero and identity covariance, $$ \mathbb{E} (|X| - \sqrt{n})^2 \leq C $$ where $C &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Thus, most of the mass of the random vector $X$ is concentrated in a thin spherical shell, whose width is only $C / \sqrt{n}$ times its radius. This confirms the thin-shell conjecture in high dimensional convex geometry. Our method relies on the construction of a certain coupling between log-affine perturbations of the law of $X$ related to Eldan's stochastic localization and to the theory of non-linear filtering. A crucial ingredient is a recent breakthrough technique by Guan that was previously used in our proof of Bourgain's slicing conjecture, which is known to be implied by the thin-shell conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, a new class of operators, termed Ad-contractions, is introduced to extend the framework of A-contractions to the setting of dislocated metric spaces. Fixed point results are established for single mappings, sequences of mappings, integral type contractions, and for mappings on a set with two dislocated metrics. The demonstrated theorems generalize foundational results on A-contractions and their integral-type variations to the more challenging setting of dislocated metric spaces. The work is supported by illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions on the complex unit disk which solve bicomplex versions of the Beltrami and related equations. Using representations in terms of their complex-valued counterparts, we show these bicomplex-valued functions recover the boundary behavior associated with the classic holomorphic Hardy spaces. This work generalizes known results for complex-valued functions and continues recent work in the setting of bicomplex analogues of Hardy spaces of both holomorphic and generalized analytic functions. Also, we show Schwarz and Dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the bicomplex Beltrami equation are solvable and provide solution formulas.</description>

      <title>Doubly transitive equiangular tight frames that contain regular simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An equiangular tight frame (ETF) is a finite sequence of equal norm vectors in a Hilbert space that achieves equality in the Welch bound, and so has minimal coherence. The binder of an ETF is the set of all subsets of its indices whose corresponding vectors form a regular simplex. An ETF achieves equality in Donoho and Elad's spark bound if and only if its binder is nonempty. When this occurs, its binder is the set of all linearly dependent subsets of it of minimal size. Moreover, if members of the binder form a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) then its incidence matrix can be phased to produce a sparse representation of its dual (Naimark complement). A few infinite families of ETFs are known to have this remarkable property. In this paper, we relate this property to the recently introduced concept of a doubly transitive equiangular tight frame (DTETF), namely an ETF for which the natural action of its symmetry group is doubly transitive. In particular, we show that the binder of any DTETF is either empty or forms a BIBD, and moreover that when the latter occurs, any member of the binder of its dual is an oval of this BIBD. We then apply this general theory to certain known infinite families of DTETFs. Specifically, any symplectic form on a finite vector space yields a DTETF, and we compute the binder of it and its dual, showing that the former is empty except in a single notable case, and that the latter consists of affine Lagrangian subspaces. This unifies and generalizes several results from the existing literature. We then consider the binders of four infinite families of DTETFs that arise from quadratic forms over the field of two elements, showing that two of these are empty except in a finite number of cases, whereas the other two form BIBDs that relate to each other, and to Lagrangian subspaces, in nonobvious ways.</description>

      <title>A strong Bishop-Phelps property and a new class of Banach spaces with the property $(A)$ of Lindenstrauss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12611v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a class of bounded closed sets $C$ in a Banach space satisfying a generalized and stronger form of the Bishop-Phelps property studied by Bourgain in \cite{Bj} for dentable sets. A version of the {\it ``Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as"} theorem will be also given. The density and the residuality of bounded linear operators attaining their maximum on $C$ (known in the literature) will be replaced, for this class of sets, by being the complement of a $\sigma$-porous set. The result of the paper is applicable for both linear operators and non-linear mappings. When we apply our result to subsets (from this class) whose closed convex hull is the closed unit ball, we obtain a new class of Banach spaces involving property $(A)$ introduced by Lindenstrauss. We also establish that this class of Banach spaces is stable under $\ell_1$-sum when the spaces have a same ``modulus". Applications to norm attaining bounded multilinear mappings and Lipschitz mappings will also be given.</description>

      <title>Sharp Riesz conjugate functions theorems for quasiregular mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the celebrated results by Riesz \cite{Rie} is the Riesz conjugate functions theorem for analytic functions in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. The study on the Riesz conjugate functions theorem for functions in higher dimensional spaces has attracted much attention. Fefferman and Stein \cite{FS-1972} established the Riesz conjugate functions theorem for the Cauchy-Riemann systems in the upper half real space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_{+}$. Astala and Koskela \cite{AS-2} investigated the Riesz conjugate functions theorem for quasiconformal mappings of the unit ball $\mathbf{B}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and posed an open problem which is as follows: Does there exist a quasiconformal analog for the Riesz theorem on conjugate functions? The purpose of this paper is to develop some methods to study this topic further, in particular, Astala-Koskela's open problem. First, we prove a sharp Riesz conjugate functions theorem for a class of quasiregular mappings of $\mathbf{B}^{n}$ for all $n\geq 2$ which satisfy the so-called Heinz's nonlinear differential inequality. As a direct consequence of this result, we find that the answer to Astala-Koskela's open problem is affirmative for harmonic quasiregular mappings of $\mathbf{B}^{n}$ for all $n\geq 2$. Second, we obtain a sharp Riesz conjugate functions theorem for invariant harmonic $K$-quasiregular mappings of $\mathbf{B}^{n}$ for all $n\geq 2$ which shows that the answer to Astala-Koskela's open problem is affirmative for these mappings. At last, we introduce the family of $\kappa$-pluriharmonic mappings of the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$, and establish a sharp Riesz conjugate functions theorem for these mappings for all $n\geq 1$. Consequently, we generalize and improve all main results by Liu and Zhu \cite{L-Z}.</description>

      <title>Free Banach lattices over pre-ordered Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study free Banach lattices over pre-ordered Banach spaces in the category of Banach lattices of a given convexity type. These generalise the free Banach lattices under convexity conditions over Banach spaces in the literature. Their existence is shown from the existence of free vector lattices over pre-ordered vector spaces, which are also investigated. We determine when the positive contraction from the pre-ordered Banach space into the free Banach lattice is injective or bipositive, and when it has closed range. It is a bipositive embedding with closed range if and only if the positive wedge of the space is a closed normal cone. Even for a Banach lattice it can be non-isometric. By analysing the norm of the free $p$-convex Banach lattice with convexity constant 1 over a pre-ordered Banach space, it becomes clear that it can be realised as a function lattice on the positive part of the dual unit ball. This generalises the known realisation for a free Banach lattice of that type over a Banach space. 
As a preparation for this analysis of the norm, characterisations of $p$-convex Banach lattices in terms of vector lattice homomorphisms into $\mathrm{L}_p(\mu)$-spaces for probability measures $\mu$ are given.</description>

      <title>The Operator Norm of Paraproducts on Bi-parameter Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that for $0&lt;p,q,r&lt;\infty$, with $\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{r}$, the operator norm of the dyadic paraproduct of the form
  \[
  \pi_g(f) := \sum_{R \in \mathcal{D}\otimes\mathcal{D}} g_R \left\langle f \right\rangle_{R} h_R,
  \]
  from the bi-parameter dyadic Hardy space $H_d^p(\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{R})$ to $\dot{H}_d^q(\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{R})$ is comparable to $\|g\|_{\dot{H}_d^r(\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{R})}$. We also prove that for all $0 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, there holds
  \[
  \|g\|_{BMO_d(\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{R})} \simeq \|\pi_g\|_{H_d^p(\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{R}) \to \dot{H}_d^p(\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{R})}.
  \]
  Similar results are obtained for bi-parameter Fourier paraproducts of the same form.</description>

      <title>Weighted estimates for a bilinear fractional integral operator and its commutator: A union condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main theme of this paper is to give sufficient conditions for the weighted boundedness of the bilinear fractional integral operator $\mathsf{BI}_\al$. The proposed condition involves the union of multilinear Muckenhoupt-type conditions. We have achieved new results in an unknown case and remarkably improved other known results by utilizing the hidden convolution nature inside the operator. We also study the effects of the general product commutators on the main operator and the weighted estimates for a related maximal operator that norm-wise dominates the main operator.</description>

      <title>Universal Gluing and Contextual Choice: Categorical Logic and the Foundations of Analytic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new categorical and constructive foundation for analytic approximation based on a Contextual Choice Principle (CCP), which enforces locality and compatibility in the construction of mathematical objects. Central to our approach is the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT), which establishes that functions in broad spaces -- including C(K), Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Omega), and distributions D'(Omega) -- can be explicitly approximated by finite-rank linear projections, each with a constructive, algorithmically verifiable certificate of accuracy.
  These constructions are governed categorically by a functorial adjunction between local logical probes and analytic models, making analytic existence both formally certifiable and programmatically extractable. As a key result, we prove a uniform certificate stability theorem, ensuring that approximation certificates persist under uniform convergence.
  The CCP avoids classical pathologies (e.g., non-measurable sets, Banach--Tarski paradoxes) by eliminating non-constructive choice and replacing it with a coherent, local-to-global semantic logic. Our framework strengthens the foundations of constructive analysis while contributing tools relevant to formal verification, type-theoretic proof systems, and computational mathematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically develop the theory of $L^{0}$-simplicial subdivisions of $L^{0}$-simplexes by grasping the inherent connection between $L^{0}$-simplexes and usual simplexes. We establish a key representation theorem of a proper $L^0$-labeling function by usual proper labeling functions. Based on the representation theorem, we can establish a general random Sperner lemma. Next, as an application of the random Sperner lemma, we give a complete proof of the known random Brouwer fixed theorem in random Euclidean spaces. Besides, all the works currently available and closely related to the randomization of the classical Brouwer fixed point theorem are unified.</description>

      <title>Energy inequalities for cutoff functions of $p$-energies on metric measures spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, and for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, we establish equivalent conditions for the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality. In particular, we employ a technique of Trudinger and Wang [Amer. J. Math. 124 (2002), no. 2, 369--410] to derive a Wolff potential estimate for superharmonic functions, and a method of Holopainen [Contemp. Math. 338 (2003), 219--239] to prove the elliptic Harnack inequality for harmonic functions. As applications, we make progress toward the capacity conjecture of Grigor'yan, Hu, and Lau [Springer Proc. Math. Stat. 88 (2014), 147--207], and we prove that the $p$-energy measure is singular with respect to the Hausdorff measure on the Sierpi\'nski carpet for all $p&gt;1$, resolving a problem posed by Murugan and Shimizu [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78 (2025), no. 9, 1523--1608].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar{\'e} inequality, a space-time Poincar{\'e} inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Marcus and Ree proved that any bistochastic matrix $A$ satisfies $\Delta_n(A):= \max_{\sigma\in S_n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}A(i, \sigma(i))-\sum_{i, j=1}^n A(i, j)^2 \geq 0$. Erd\H{o}s asked to characterize the bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_n(A)=0$. This problem remains largely open, and very recently, a complete list of such matrices was obtained in dimension $n=3$ by Bouthat, Mashreghi, and Morneau-Gu\'erin. Soon after, Tripathi proved that there were only finitely many such matrices in any dimension $n$. In this paper, we continue the investigation initiated in these two works. We characterize all $4\times 4$ bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_4(A)=0$. Furthermore, we show that for $n\geq 3$, $\Delta_n(A)=\alpha$ has uncountably many solutions when $\alpha\in (0, (n-1)/4)$. This answers a question raised in [Tripathi, R., $\textit{Some observations on Erd\H{o}s matrices}$, Linear Algebra and Its Applications 708 (2025)]. We also extend the Marcus\unicode{x2013}Ree inequality to infinite bistochastic arrays and bistochastic kernels. Our investigation into $4\times 4$ Erd\H{o}s matrices also leads to several intriguing questions of independent interest. We propose several questions and conjectures and present numerical evidence for them.</description>

      <title>Composition structure of polyconvolution associated with index Kontorovich-Lebedev transform and Fourier integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Kakichev's classical concept and extending Yakubovich-Britvina's approach (\textit{Results. Math.} 55(1-2):175-197, 2009) and (\textit{Integral Transforms Spec. Funct.} 21(4):259--276, 2010) for setting up Kontorovich-Lebedev convolution operators, this paper proposes a new polyconvolution structure associated with the KL-transform and Fourier integrals. Our main contributions include demonstrating a one-dimensional Watson-type transform, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for this transform to serve as unitary on $L_2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, and inferring its inverse operator in symmetric form. The existence of this structure over specific function spaces and its connection with previously known convolutions are pointed out. Establish the Plancherel-type theorem, prove the convergence in the mean-square sense in $L_2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, and prove the boundedness of dual spaces via Riesz-Thorin's theorem. Derives new weighted $L_p$-norm inequalities and boundedness in a three-parametric family of Lebesgue spaces. These theoretical findings are applied to solve specific classes of the Toeplitz-Hankel equation, providing a priori estimations based on the established conditions for $L_1$ solvability.</description>

      <title>Exact Confining Solution of the Planar QCD Loop Equation via a Matrix Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the planar QCD loop equation in four-dimensional Euclidean space using a novel matrix-valued momentum loop formalism. Central to this construction is a new loop calculus, in which functional derivatives act directly on the loop velocity \( \dot{C}(\theta) \). This framework yields finite, well-defined expressions for point and area derivatives in loop space and reveals the role of the loop-space Bianchi identity in ensuring gauge consistency.
  The Wilson loop is expressed as an average over matrix-valued momentum loops \( P(\theta) \) tracing closed paths in a compact complex manifold, constrained by self-duality and boundary conditions. Self-duality dynamically nullifies the classical Yang--Mills term in the loop equation, while the boundary constraints eliminate the contact terms in the planar (\( N \to \infty \)) limit. Thus, the full planar QCD loop equation is satisfied exactly and without modification.
  We further argue that these random walks define a self-dual minimal surface in an extended matrix space, and \textbf{prove} that the area of this matrix minimal surface scales proportionally to the Euclidean minimal area bounded by the same loop \( C \), thereby providing a sufficient condition for quark confinement. In the example of an elliptic loop, we construct the exact surface and compute its area analytically, finding that it equals the Euclidean area multiplied by a universal factor of \( 1/\sqrt{2} \), independent of the ellipse parameters.
  These results provide the first known explicit construction of a quark-confining minimal surface that solves the planar QCD loop equation exactly, and open a new path toward understanding gauge--string duality from first principles.</description>

Abstract: We study quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for two different perimeter-type functionals. We first consider classical capillarity functionals, which measure the perimeter of sets in a Euclidean half-space, assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1, 1)$ to the portion of the boundary that lies on the boundary of the half-space. We then consider the relative perimeter of sets contained in some suitable convex cone in the Euclidean space. In both settings, we establish sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in the so-called strong form. More precisely, we show that the isoperimetric deficit of a competitor not only controls the Fraenkel asymmetry, but it also controls an oscillation asymmetry that measures how much the unit normals to the boundary of a competitor deviate from those of an isoperimetric set. Our technique is also able to explicitly identify a center that can be employed to compute the asymmetries. In particular, we also derive barycentric versions of these quantitative isoperimetric inequalities (both in the classical and in the strong form). The proofs are based on the derivation of Fuglede-type estimates for graphs defined on general spherically convex domains, in combination with a new application of the selection principle that directly provides the inequalities in barycentric form.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence to initial data of heat and Poisson equations in Modulation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize weighted modulation spaces (data space) for which the heat semigroup $e^{-tL}f$ converges pointwise to the initial data $f$ as time $t$ tends to zero. Here $L$ stands for the standard Laplacian $-\Delta $ or Hermite operator $H=-\Delta +|x|^2$ on the whole domain. Similar result also holds for Poisson semigroup $e^{-t\sqrt{L}}f.$ We also prove that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator operates on certain modulation spaces. This may be of independent interest.</description>
