      <title>Maestro: Intelligent Execution for Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation remains essential for developing and validating quantum algorithms, especially as current quantum hardware is limited in scale and quality. However, the growing diversity of simulation methods and software tools creates a high barrier to selecting the most suitable backend for a given circuit. We introduce Maestro, a unified interface for quantum circuit simulation that integrates multiple simulation paradigms - state vector, MPS, tensor network, stabilizer, GPU-accelerated, and p-block methods - under a single API. Maestro includes a predictive runtime model that automatically selects the optimal simulator based on circuit structure and available hardware, and applies backend-specific optimizations such as multiprocessing, GPU execution, and improved sampling. Benchmarks across heterogeneous workloads demonstrate that Maestro outperforms individual simulators in both single-circuit and large batched settings, particularly in high-performance computing environments. Maestro provides a scalable, extensible platform for quantum algorithm research, hybrid quantum-classical workflows, and emerging distributed quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Polynomiogram: An Integrated Framework for Root Visualization and Generative Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the Polynomiogram framework, an integrated computational platform for exploring, visualizing, and generating art from polynomial root systems. The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Batched BLAS/LAPACK Kernels on GPUs for Parallel Solutions of Block Tridiagonal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block-tridiagonal systems are prevalent in state estimation and optimal control, and solving these systems is often the computational bottleneck. Improving the underlying solvers therefore has a direct impact on the real-time performance of estimators and controllers. We present a GPU-based implementation for the factorization and solution of block-tridiagonal symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems. Our method employs a recursive Schur-complement reduction, transforming the original system into a hierarchy of smaller, independent systems that can be solved in parallel using batched BLAS/LAPACK routines. Performance benchmarks with our cross-platform (NVIDIA and AMD) implementation, BlockDSS, show substantial speed-ups over state-of-the-art CPU direct solvers, including CHOLMOD and HSL MA57, while remaining competitive with NVIDIA cuDSS. At the same time, the current implementation still invokes batched routines sequentially at each recursion level, and high efficiency requires block sizes large enough to amortize kernel launch overhead.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Adaptive Isotropic and Anisotropic Image-to-mesh Conversion for Numerical Simulations Involving Cerebral Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presented are two techniques that are designed to help streamline the discretization of complex vascular geometries within the numerical modeling process. The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</description>
