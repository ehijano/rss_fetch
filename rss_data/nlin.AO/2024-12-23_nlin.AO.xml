      <title>What Leads to Administrative Bloat? A Dynamic Model of Administrative Cost and Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantitative, dynamic model that captures how environmental change, alignment with the environment, managerial decisions, and resource constraints interact to give rise to administrative bloat in organizations, resulting in organizational failure. Inspired by empirical findings, we model codified processes that, while initially useful, become obsolete as conditions change, consuming resources until actively removed. Our model predicts a critical threshold in management decision parameters -- the propensity to create processes in response to problems, and the propensity to prune obsolete processes in response to administrative burden. This threshold determines two possible outcomes: a sustainable equilibrium, where administrative costs stabilize below resource limits, and runaway administrative bloat, where costs -- dominated by obsolete processes -- grow to resource capacity. The threshold worsens with faster environmental changes. A short-term environmental shock exceeding a critical threshold can push organizations from sustainability into bloat cycles, highlighting the risks posed by events like technological upheaval. Importantly, process creation and pruning propensities have asymmetrical impacts on outcomes. Avoiding administrative bloat requires carefully balancing codified and ad-hoc solutions, weighing error costs, and anticipating future process obsolescence. Finally, We also discuss how our model may be applied to generate insight from existing and future data.</description>

      <title>Does the brain behave like a (complex) network? I. Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph theory is now becoming a standard tool in system-level neuroscience. However, endowing observed brain anatomy and dynamics with a complex network structure does not entail that the brain actually works as a network. Asking whether the brain behaves as a network means asking whether network properties count. From the viewpoint of neurophysiology and, possibly, of brain physics, the most substantial issues a network structure may be instrumental in addressing relate to the influence of network properties on brain dynamics and to whether these properties ultimately explain some aspects of brain function. Here, we address the dynamical implications of complex network, examining which aspects and scales of brain activity may be understood to genuinely behave as a network. To do so, we first define the meaning of networkness, and analyse some of its implications. We then examine ways in which brain anatomy and dynamics can be endowed with a network structure and discuss possible ways in which network structure may be shown to represent a genuine organisational principle of brain activity, rather than just a convenient description of its anatomy and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Self-organization in a stably stratified, valley-shaped enclosure heated from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe the spontaneous onset of three-dimensional motion from a quiescent, purely conductive state of a stably stratified fluid in a V-shaped enclosure heated from below, which ultimately self-organizes into a two-dimensional steady state without any external forcing to the initial configuration. We identify a dominant three-dimensional instability through modal stability analysis. Direct numerical simulations confirm this instability but also reveal that, after an initial period of spontaneous three-dimensional growth, the flow gradually self-organizes into a steady two-dimensional state without external intervention. This self-organization manifests consistently for any arbitrary infinitesimal three-dimensional disturbance to the initial quiescent configuration. We demonstrate that the mechanism driving this self-organization is the increasing dominance of viscous dissipation over buoyant production of disturbance kinetic energy at later stages of flow evolution from the initial quiescent state. Our investigation reveals a flow scenario in which the most natural transition pathway to the final state involves passing through an intermediate state with a higher dimension than the final state itself. Specifically, our final flow state is less complex than the three-dimensional most unstable eigenvector predicted by linear stability analysis. We demonstrate that the entire flow evolution remains non-turbulent throughout and closely aligns with results from linear stability analysis, distinguishing the present flow dynamics from transient chaos, which also features complex transient states that eventually converge to a less complex final state.</description>
