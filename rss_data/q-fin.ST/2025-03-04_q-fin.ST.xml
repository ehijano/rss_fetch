      <title>Understanding the Commodity Futures Term Structure Through Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signature methods have been widely and effectively used as a tool for feature extraction in statistical learning methods, notably in mathematical finance. They lack, however, interpretability: in the general case, it is unclear why signatures actually work. The present article aims to address this issue directly, by introducing and developing the concept of signature perturbations. In particular, we construct a regular perturbation of the signature of the term structure of log prices for various commodities, in terms of the convenience yield. Our perturbation expansion and rigorous convergence estimates help explain the success of signature-based classification of commodities markets according to their term structure, with the volatility of the convenience yield as the major discriminant.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a portion of short-term price jumps in crypto assets results from liquidity fluctuations induced by wash trading. We develop a model decomposing liquidity into two components: liquidity jump (size of fluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (probability of fluctuation). High values for both liquidity measures indicate wash trading, while high liquidity jump with low liquidity diffusion suggests legitimate high-demand trading. Together, these liquidity measures enable detection of wash trades and help market participants understand liquidity dynamics, and make informed decisions in crypto trading.</description>

      <title>Market-Derived Financial Sentiment Analysis: Context-Aware Language Models for Crypto Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial Sentiment Analysis (FSA) traditionally relies on human-annotated sentiment labels to infer investor sentiment and forecast market movements. However, inferring the potential market impact of words based on their human-perceived intentions is inherently challenging. We hypothesize that the historical market reactions to words, offer a more reliable indicator of their potential impact on markets than subjective sentiment interpretations by human annotators. To test this hypothesis, a market-derived labeling approach is proposed to assign tweet labels based on ensuing short-term price trends, enabling the language model to capture the relationship between textual signals and market dynamics directly. A domain-specific language model was fine-tuned on these labels, achieving up to an 11% improvement in short-term trend prediction accuracy over traditional sentiment-based benchmarks. Moreover, by incorporating market and temporal context through prompt-tuning, the proposed context-aware language model demonstrated an accuracy of 89.6% on a curated dataset of 227 impactful Bitcoin-related news events with significant market impacts. Aggregating daily tweet predictions into trading signals, our method outperformed traditional fusion models (which combine sentiment-based and price-based predictions). It challenged the assumption that sentiment-based signals are inferior to price-based predictions in forecasting market movements. Backtesting these signals across three distinct market regimes yielded robust Sharpe ratios of up to 5.07 in trending markets and 3.73 in neutral markets. Our findings demonstrate that language models can serve as effective short-term market predictors. This paradigm shift underscores the untapped capabilities of language models in financial decision-making and opens new avenues for market prediction applications.</description>
