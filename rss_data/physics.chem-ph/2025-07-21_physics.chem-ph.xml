      <title>Spin-free Generalised Normal Ordered Coupled Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spin-free, size-extensive, and size-consistent coupled cluster method based on a generalised normal ordered exponential ansatz. This approach is a natural generalisation of single-reference coupled cluster theory for arbitrary spin eigenfunctions. The working equations are size-extensive through the generalised normal order formalism, and made spin-free with the spin-ensemble approach. Redundancies amongst excitations are eliminated by selecting only those excitations that project the reference function onto the first-order interacting space. Furthermore, by utilising localised orbitals, the proposed method describes dissociation into open-shell fragments size-consistently. Numerical results on prototypical multireference systems at the singles and doubles level of theory are competitive with existing multireference approaches, yet with more compact working equations.</description>

      <title>Robust Surface-Induced Enhancement of Exciton Transport in Magic-Angle-Oriented Molecular Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton transport in molecular aggregates with magic-angle orientation is expected to be strongly suppressed due to their negligible dipole-dipole interactions. However, recent reports show that light-matter interactions can significantly enhance exciton transport attributed to the effective long-range coupling mediated by the photonic fields. To elucidate their interplay, we employ the macroscopic quantum electrodynamics framework to simulate exciton transport within a chromophore array arranged in a magic-angle configuration in proximity to a silver surface. Our results show a significant enhancement of the exciton diffusion coefficient that is robust across variations in chromophore-surface separation, intermolecular distance, and molecular transition frequency. Furthermore, based on the image-dipole method, we derive analytical expressions that agree well with numerical simulations, revealing the enhancement's origin in the near-field coupling term as induced by the radiative scattering at the metallic surface. More importantly, we observe non-trivial differences in the diffusion coefficient's scaling near metallic surfaces compared to free space. Our findings highlight the potential to control exciton transport by designing coupled exciton-photon systems and engineering the dielectric environments.</description>

      <title>Harnessing multi-mode optical structure for chemical reactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospect of controlling chemical reactivity using frequency-tunable optical microcavities has materialized over the past decade, evolving into a fascinating yet challenging new field of polaritonic chemistry, a multidisciplinary domain at the intersection of quantum optics, chemical dynamics, and non-equilibrium many-body physics. While most theoretical efforts to date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in polaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a series of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry. In this work, we present a numerically exact, fully quantum-mechanical study of chemical reactions in few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios by which multi-mode effects can enhance cavity-modified reactivity. The first scenario emerges when the free spectral range is comparable to the single-mode Rabi splitting. In such cases, hybridization between a rate-decisive molecular vibration and a central resonant cavity mode reshapes the resonance landscape, enabling additional reaction pathways mediated by adjacent cavity modes. The second scenario exploits the intrinsic anharmonicity of molecular vibrations, which gives rise to multiple dipole-allowed transitions with distinct energies. Under multi-mode strong coupling, where different cavity modes individually resonate with these distinct transitions, multi-photon processes involving sequential absorption across multiple modes become accessible. This leads to a nontrivial and non-additive rate enhancement via cascade-like vibrational ladder climbing. Together, these findings offer new strategies for tailoring chemical reactivity by harnessing the structural richness of multi-mode structure, offering valuable insights for optimal experimental designs in polaritonic catalysis.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological characterization of the isomerization transition state of carbonyl sulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures of excited-state quantum phase transitions in the bending degree of freedom of triatomic systems that undergo an isomerization reaction have been recently evinced. In this work, we study the carbonyl sulfide bending motion using an effective Hamiltonian within the two-dimensional limit of the vibron model framework, which has been shown to accurately describe critical phenomena in molecular bending spectra within experimental precision. To estimate the transition state energy barrier, we propose an improvement to a phenomenological formula proposed by Baraban et al.[1] , introducing a new term to capture the anharmonicity change that characterizes quasilinear molecules</description>

      <title>Single spin exact gradients for the optimization of complex pulses and pulse sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient computer optimization of magnetic resonance pulses and pulse sequences involves the calculation of a problem-adapted cost function as well as its gradients with respect to all controls applied. The gradients generally can be calculated as a finite difference approximation, as a GRAPE approximation, or as an exact function, e.g. by the use of the augmented matrix exponentiation, where the exact gradient should lead to best optimization convergence. However, calculation of exact gradients is computationally expensive and analytical exact solutions to the problem would be highly desirable. As the majority of todays pulse optimizations involve a single spin 1/2, which can be represented by simple rotation matrices in the Bloch space or by their corresponding Cayley-Klein/quaternion parameters, the derivations of analytical exact gradient functions appear to be feasible. Taking two optimization types, the optimization of point-to-point pulses using 3D-rotations and the optimization of universal rotation pulses using quaternions, analytical solutions for gradients with respect to controls have been derived. Controls in this case can be conventional $x$ and $y$ pulses, but also $z$-controls, as well as gradients with respect to amplitude and phase of a pulse shape. In addition, analytical solutions with respect to pseudo controls, involving holonomic constraints to maximum rf-amplitudes, maximum rf-power, or maximum rf-energy, are introduced. Using the hyperbolic tangent function, maximum values are imposed in a fully continuous and differentiable way. The obtained analytical gradients allow the calculation two orders of magnitude faster than the augmented matrix exponential approach. The exact gradients for different controls are finally compared in a number of optimizations involving broadband pulses for $^{15}$N, $^{13}$C, and $^{19}$F applications.</description>

      <title>Competing Length Scales and Symmetry Frustration Govern Non-Universal Melting in 2D Core-softened Colloidal Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the melting behavior of two-dimensional colloidal crystals stabilized by a core-softened potential featuring two competing interaction length scales. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze three polymorphic solid phases -- low-density triangular, stripe, and kagome -- and uncover distinct melting pathways. The triangular and kagome crystals undergo abrupt first-order transitions, driven by the interplay between energetic frustration and structural reorganization. In particular, the LDT phase melts through a sharp transition induced by a crossover between the two characteristic length scales. In contrast, the stripe phase exhibits a continuous transition with liquid-crystalline features: orientational and translational order decay gradually, while intra-stripe mobility persists, consistent with a KTHNY-like scenario. These findings demonstrate that melting in 2D soft-matter systems is inherently non-universal and governed by the competition between lattice symmetry, frustration, and multiple interaction scales. Our results provide microscopic insight into melting mechanisms beyond classical universality classes and offer guiding principles for the design of self-assembled materials with tunable phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium origin of cavity-induced resonant modifications of chemical reactivities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of light-matter coupling on reaction dynamics and equilibrium properties of a single molecule inside an optical cavity. The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned into resonance with a vibrational transition directly leading to the formation of the corresponding product, even when that transition is spectroscopically dark. However, tuning cavity frequency to match an absorption-dominant transition shared across both reaction pathways does not necessarily result in pronounced rate enhancements and selectivity. Together with an additional analysis using an asymmetric double-well model, we highlight the greater complexity of underlying factors governing chemical reactivity, which extend beyond considerations of transition dipole strengths and thermal population distributions that shape linear spectroscopy. Furthermore, we found that in all scenarios, the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our study confirms at a fully quantum-mechanical level that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.</description>

      <title>MC-PDFT Nuclear Gradients and L-PDFT Energies with Meta and Hybrid Meta On-Top Functionals for Ground- and Excited-State Geometry Optimization and Vertical Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) is a post-MCSCF multireference electronic-structure method that explicitly models strong electron correlation, and linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed multi-state extension that can accurately model conical intersections and locally-avoided crossings. Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23 performs the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical excitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2 multireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our MC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and find that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density functional.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Pretraining for Molecular Property Prediction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in property prediction, but they often require large amounts of labeled data. The challenge is that, in real-world applications, labels are extremely scarce, as obtaining them through laboratory experimentation is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we introduce MoleVers, a versatile pretrained molecular model designed for various types of molecular property prediction in the wild, i.e., where experimentally-validated labels are scarce. MoleVers employs a two-stage pretraining strategy. In the first stage, it learns molecular representations from unlabeled data through masked atom prediction and extreme denoising, a novel task enabled by our newly introduced branching encoder architecture and dynamic noise scale sampling. In the second stage, the model refines these representations through predictions of auxiliary properties derived from computational methods, such as the density functional theory or large language models. Evaluation on 22 small, experimentally-validated datasets demonstrates that MoleVers achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of its two-stage framework in producing generalizable molecular representations for diverse downstream properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generative Deep Learning Framework for Inverse Design of Fuels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model can be adapted to different target properties, enabling systematic exploration of large chemical spaces relevant to fuel design applications. Furthermore, the demonstrated framework can be readily extended by incorporating additional synthesizability criteria to improve applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.</description>
