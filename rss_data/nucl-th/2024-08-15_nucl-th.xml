      <title>Collective behaviour in proton number fluctuations seen in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.4 GeV Au+Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At energies of a few GeV per nucleon, nuclear collisions exhibit phenomena more complex than the individualistic nucleon interactions observed at much higher energies. From recent results on proton number fluctuations in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$~GeV obtained by the HADES experiment at GSI, we suggest that measuring the multiplicity distributions heavy-ion collisions can be used to probe density fluctuations associated with correlation phenomena. By using the combinant analysis, one can obtain new information contained in them and otherwise unavailable, which may broaden our knowledge of the particle interactions mechanism.</description>

      <title>Ab initio computations from $^{78}$Ni towards $^{70}$Ca along neutron number $N=50$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present coupled-cluster computations of nuclei with neutron number $N=50$ "south" of $^{78}$Ni using nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory. We find an erosion of the magic number $N=50$ toward $^{70}$Ca manifesting itself by an onset of deformation and increased complexity in the ground states. For $^{78}$Ni, we predict a low-lying rotational band consistent with recent data, which up until now has been a challenge for ab initio nuclear models. Ground states are deformed in $^{76}$Fe, $^{74}$Cr, and $^{72}$Ti, although the spherical states are too close in energy to unambiguously identify the shape of the ground state within the uncertainty estimates. In $^{70}$Ca, the potential energy landscape from quadrupole-constrained Hartree-Fock computations flattens, and the deformation becomes less rigid. We also compute the low-lying spectra and $B({\rm E2})$ values for these neutron-rich $N=50$ nuclei.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel scattering emulator utilizing the complex scaling method to enhance nuclear reaction analysis. This approach leverages a single set of reduced bases, allowing for efficient and simultaneous emulation across multiple channels and potential parameters, significantly reducing computational storage and accelerating calculations. Demonstrated through \(n\)+\(^{40}\)Ca and \(^{11}\)Be+\(^{64}\)Zn elastic scattering, our method achieves high accuracy and efficiency. This emulator exhibits stable and reliable performance without anomalies inherent in other techniques, showcasing its robustness.</description>

      <title>Collision Energy Dependence of Particle Ratios and Freeze-out Parameters in Ultra Relativistic Nucleus Nucleus Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how the theoretically calculated particle ratios and freeze-out parameters for a multi-component hot and dense non-ideal hadron resonance gas system, formed during the pre freeze-out stage in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, are affected by van der Waals type interactions, incorporating both repulsive and attractive interactions among hadrons. The baryons (antibaryons) are treated as hard incompressible objects. Using this theoretical approach, we analyze experimental particle ratios involving like-mass as well as unlike-mass hadrons. We also try to understand the existence of horn-like structures seen in the ratios of strange particles to pion as a function of the collision energy. Using information about the dependence of experimental particle ratios on $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ over a wide range of collision energies, we have extracted several model freeze-out parameters and examined their dependence on $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ The correlation between the $\bar{p}/p$ and $K^-/K^+$ ratios is also examined.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference analysis of jet quenching using inclusive jet and hadron suppression measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JETSCAPE Collaboration reports a new determination of the jet transport parameter $\hat{q}$ in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) using Bayesian Inference, incorporating all available inclusive hadron and jet yield suppression data measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. This multi-observable analysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian Inference determination of $\hat{q}$, which was based solely on a selection of inclusive hadron suppression data. JETSCAPE is a modular framework incorporating detailed dynamical models of QGP formation and evolution, and jet propagation and interaction in the QGP. Virtuality-dependent partonic energy loss in the QGP is modeled as a thermalized weakly-coupled plasma, with parameters determined from Bayesian calibration using soft-sector observables. This Bayesian calibration of $\hat{q}$ utilizes Active Learning, a machine--learning approach, for efficient exploitation of computing resources. The experimental data included in this analysis span a broad range in collision energy and centrality, and in transverse momentum. In order to explore the systematic dependence of the extracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are reported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data separately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and hadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing new insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical formulation.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays Spectrum in Heavy Ion Reactions with Richardson-Lucy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high momentum tail (HMT) in the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi surface has been regarded as an evidence of short-range correlations (SRCs) in atomic nuclei. It has been showcased recently that the $np$ Bremsstrahlung radiation in heavy ion reactions can be used to extract HMT information. The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm is introduced to the reconstruction of the original Bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray energy spectrum from experimental measurements. By solving the inverse problem of the detector response to the $\gamma$-rays, the original energy spectrum of the Bremsstrahlung $\gamma$ in 25 MeV/u $^{86}$Kr + $^{124}$Sn has been reconstructed and compared to the isospin- and momentum-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) simulations. The analysis based on hypothesis test suggests the existence of the HMT of nucleons in nuclei, in accordance with the previous conclusions. With its effectiveness being demonstrated, it is feasible to apply the RL algorithm in future experiments of measuring the Bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays in heavy ion reactions.</description>

      <title>Effects of pairing strength on the nuclear structure and double-$\beta$ decay predictions within the mapped interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy nuclear structure and two-neutrino double-$\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decay are studied within the interacting boson model (IBM) that is based on the nuclear energy density functional (EDF). The IBM Hamiltonian describing the initial and final even-even nuclei, and the interacting boson fermion-fermion Hamiltonian producing the intermediate states of the neighboring odd-odd nuclei are determined by the microscopic inputs provided by the self-consistent mean-field (SCMF) calculations employing a relativistic EDF and a separable pairing force. Sensitivities of the low-lying structure and $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay properties to the pairing strength are specifically analyzed. It is shown that the SCMF calculations with decreased and increased pairing strengths lead to quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strengths in the IBM that are, respectively, significantly enhanced and reduced in magnitude. When the increased pairing is adopted, in particular, the energy levels of the excited $0^+$ states are lowered, and the predicted $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) increase in magnitude systematically. The mapped IBM employing the increased pairing force generates effective NMEs and half-lives that are in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data for the $^{76}$Ge$\to^{76}$Se, $^{82}$Se$\to^{82}$Kr, and $^{100}$Mo$\to^{100}$Ru decays in particular, whereas the calculation with the standard pairing strength is adequate to provide an overall good description of the effective NMEs in agreement with data.</description>

      <title>Determining the $CP$ Property of $ht\bar{t}$ Coupling via a Novel Jet Substructure Observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the $CP$ property of the Higgs boson is important for a precision test of the Standard Model as well as for the search for new physics. We propose a novel jet substructure observable based on the azimuthal anisotropy in a linearly polarized gluon jet that is produced in association with a Higgs boson at hadron colliders, and demonstrate that it provides a new $CP$-odd observable for determining the $CP$ property of the Higgs-top interaction. We introduce a factorization formalism to define a polarized gluon jet function with the insertion of an infrared-safe azimuthal observable to capture the linear polarization.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions of spin-1 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>
