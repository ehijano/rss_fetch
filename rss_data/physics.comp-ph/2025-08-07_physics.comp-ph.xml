      <title>FFTArray: A Python Library for the Implementation of Discretized Multi-Dimensional Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations describing the dynamics of physical systems rarely have closed-form solutions. Fourier spectral methods, which use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to approximate solutions, are a common approach to solving these equations. However, implementing those requires careful attention to grid selection and coordinate-dependent phase and scale factors when mapping the Fourier integrals to discrete FFTs. Most existing software packages integrate the Fourier transform discretization tightly into their full-stack implementations. This integrated design sacrifices generality, making it difficult to adapt to new coordinate systems, boundary conditions, or problem-specific requirements. To address these challenges, we present FFTArray, a Python library that automates the general discretization of Fourier transforms. It allows to easily define valid coordinate grids and efficiently applies the coordinate grid specific corrections with minimal impact on computational performance. Built on the Python Array API Standard, FFTArray supports GPU acceleration and integrates seamlessly with array backends like NumPy, JAX and PyTorch. Its interface enables the direct translation of textbook equations and complex research problems into code, while its modular design scales naturally to multiple dimensions. FFTArray allows scientists to focus on their core scientific challenges and thereby reduces the barrier to developing high-performance, maintainable code for pseudo-spectral Fourier methods.

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network for Elastic Wave-Mode Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode conversion in non-homogeneous elastic media makes it challenging to interpret physical properties accurately. Decomposing these modes correctly is crucial across various scientific areas. Recent machine learning approaches have been proposed to address this problem, utilizing the Helmholtz decomposition technique. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) in separating P and S modes by solving a scalar Poisson equation. This scalar formulation offers a dimensionally scalable reduction in computational cost compared to the traditional vector formulation. We verify the proposed method in both homogeneous and realistic non-homogeneous elastic models as showcases. The obtained separated modes closely match those from conventional numerical techniques, while exhibiting reduced transverse wave leakage.</description>

      <title>MD-LLM-1: A Large Language Model for Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful approach for modelling molecular systems, but it remains computationally intensive on spatial and time scales of many macromolecular systems of biological interest. To explore the opportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a Molecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how LLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in training. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach, obtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein systems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the prediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1 can learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes of proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics and kinetics.</description>

      <title>Calculating Vibronic Spectra with a linear algorithm based on Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately simulating molecular vibronic spectra remains computationally challenging due to the exponential scaling of required calculations. Here, we show that employing the linear coupling model within the gaussian boson sampling framework effectively addresses this limitation. We implement the algorithm for simulating the pentacene molecule through three distinct approaches, using numerical simulation on a classical computer and experimentally using two optical setups equipped with different photon detectors (SNSPD and SPAD). High fidelity $(F&gt;0.999)$ was achieved between the simulated Franck-Condon profiles and analytically calculated profiles obtained by enumerating all possible transitions within the linear coupling model. Furthermore, simulations were performed for larger molecular systems using 48 vibrational modes of naphthalene and 64 vibrational modes of anthracene. Comparison with experimental data confirms that the simulated spectra accurately reproduce both the positions and shapes of the measured spectral bands. A notable advantage of our algorithm is its scalability, requiring only a fixed minimal set of optical components irrespective of the size of the studied system.</description>

      <title>A high-order deterministic dynamical low-rank method for proton transport in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dose calculations in proton therapy require the fast and accurate solution of a high-dimensional transport equation for a large number of (pencil) beams with different energies and directions. Deterministically solving this transport problem at a sufficient resolution can however be prohibitively expensive, especially due to highly forward peaked scattering of the protons. We propose using a model order reduction approach, the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), which evolves the solution on the manifold of low-rank matrices in (pseudo-)time. For this, we compare a collided-uncollided split of the linear Boltzmann equation and its Fokker-Planck approximation. We treat the uncollided part using a ray-tracer and combine high-order phase space discretizations and a mixture model for materials with DLRA for the collided equation. Our method reproduces the results of a full-rank reference code at significantly lower rank, and thus computational cost and memory, and further makes computations feasible at much higher resolutions. At higher resolutions, we also achieve good accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous materials. Finally, we demonstrate that several beam sources with different angles can be computed with little cost increase compared to individual beams.</description>

      <title>Simulations of dielectric permittivity of water by Machine Learned Potentials with long-range Coulombic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</description>

      <title>GPU-based compressible lattice Boltzmann simulations on non-uniform grids using standard C++ parallelism: From best practices to aerodynamics, aeroacoustics and supersonic flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, creating accurate, robust, and efficient lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) on non-uniform grids with seamless GPU acceleration remains challenging. This work introduces a novel strategy to address this challenge by integrating simple yet effective components: (1) parallel algorithms in modern C++, (2) conservative cell-centered grid refinement, (3) local boundary conditions, and (4) robust collision models. Our framework supports multiple lattices (D2Q9, D2Q13, D2Q21, D2Q37, D3Q27, etc) tailored to various flow conditions. It includes collision models with polynomial and numerical equilibria, a second distribution for polyatomic behavior, a Jameson-like shock sensor, and generalizes Rohde's refinement strategy.
  The framework's accuracy and robustness is validated across diverse benchmarks, including lid-driven cavity flows, Aeolian noise, 30P30N airfoil aerodynamics, inviscid Riemann problems, and viscous flows past a NACA airfoil in transonic and supersonic regimes. Modern C++ further enables our framework to reach GPU-native performance, while ensuring high portability, modularity, and ease of implementation. Notably, weakly compressible LBMs achieve state-of-the-art GPU efficiency on non-uniform grids, while fully compressible LBMs benefit from acceleration equivalent to thousands of CPU cores in the most compute-intensive cases. Our advanced performance models incorporate neighbor-list and asynchronous time-stepping effects, providing new insights into the performance decomposition of LB simulations on non-uniform grids.
  Overall, this study sets a new standard for portable, tree-based LBMs, demonstrating that a combination of well-chosen components can achieve high performance, accuracy, and robustness across various flow conditions. As a final proof-of-concept, adaptive mesh refinement is proposed for subsonic and supersonic applications.</description>

      <title>DBSCAN in domains with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many scientific problems involve data that is embedded in a space with periodic boundary conditions. This can for instance be related to an inherent cyclic or rotational symmetry in the data or a spatially extended periodicity. When analyzing such data, well-tailored methods are needed to obtain efficient approaches that obey the periodic boundary conditions of the problem. In this work, we present a method for applying a clustering algorithm to data embedded in a periodic domain based on the DBSCAN algorithm, a widely used unsupervised machine learning method that identifies clusters in data. The proposed method internally leverages the conventional DBSCAN algorithm for domains with open boundaries, such that it remains compatible with all optimized implementations for neighborhood searches in open domains. In this way, it retains the same optimized runtime complexity of $O(N\log N)$. We demonstrate the workings of the proposed method using synthetic data in one, two and three dimensions and also apply it to a real-world example involving the clustering of bubbles in a turbulent flow. The proposed approach is implemented in a ready-to-use Python package that we make publicly available.</description>

      <title>A general formalism for machine-learning models based on multipolar-spherical harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.</description>

      <title>Empirical Hyper Element Integration Method (EHEIM) with Unified Integration Criteria for Efficient Hyper Reduced FE$^2$ Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical homogenization for mechanical multiscale modeling by means of the finite element method (FEM) is an elegant way of obtaining structure-property relations, if the behavior of the constituents of the lower scale is well understood. However, the computational costs of this so-called FE$^2$ method are so high that reduction methods are essential. While the construction of a reduced basis for the microscopic nodal displacements using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has become a standard technique, the reduction of the computational effort for the projected nodal forces, the so-called hyper reduction, is an additional challenge, for which different strategies have been proposed in the literature. The empirical cubature method (ECM), which has been proven to be very robust, implemented the conservation of the total volume is used as a constraint in the resulting optimization problem, while energy-based criteria have been proposed in other contributions.
  The present contribution presents a unified integration criteria concept, involving the aforementioned criteria, among others. These criteria are used both with a Gauss point-based as well as with an element-based hyper reduction scheme, the latter retaining full compatibility with the common modular finite element framework. The methods are combined with a previously proposed clustered training strategy and a monolithic solver. Numerical examples empirically demonstrate that the additional criteria improve the accuracy for a given number of modes. Vice verse, less modes and thus lower computational costs are required to reach a given level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Toda lattice formed in nonequilibrium steady states of SWCNT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toda lattice or FPUT chain-like dynamics have been regarded as the prerequisite condition to explain the length dependency of high thermal conductivity of low-dimensional systems at the nanoscale. In this paper, a hypothetical condition is introduced that establishes a theoretical connection between the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale low-dimensional system in nonequilibrium steady states(NESS) and the canonical motion of the equation in the Toda lattice in equilibrium. The hypothesis relies on a numerically driven coarse grained molecular dynamics system acquired from the trajectory data of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) simulation. It models the macroscopic motion from longitudinal and flexural modulation observed in NEMD as a separate Hamiltonian in CGMD with a perturbation term governed by an overdamping process, which is assumed to be dominant during heat transfer. The Smoluchowski equation for the perturbation, which is derived from the cross correlated states between two degrees of freedom, suggests that the potential energy function induced from NESS is identical to that of Toda Lattice under the specific condition in the partition function for CG particles. The restrictions derived from the model are well confirmed by the data from the numerically driven CG model.</description>
