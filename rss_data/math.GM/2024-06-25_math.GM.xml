      <title>New averaged type algorithms for solving split common fixed-point problem for demicontractive mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose new averaged iterative algorithms designed for solving a split common fixed-point problem in the class of demicontractive mappings. The algorithms are obtained by inserting an averaged term into the algorithms used in [Li, R. and He, Z., A new iterative algorithm for split solution problems of quasi-nonexpansive mappings {\it J. Inequal. Appl.} {\bf 131} (2015), 1--12.] for solving the same problem but in the class of quasi-nonexpansive mappings, which is a subclass of demicontractive mappings. Basically, our investigation is based on the embedding of demicontractive operators in the class of quasi-nonexpansive operators by means of averaged mappings. For the considered algorithms we prove weak and strong convergence theorems in the setting of a real Hilbert space and also provide examples to show that our results are effective generalizations of existing results in literature.</description>

      <title>On approximately Convex and Affine Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our primary objective is to study a possible decomposition of an approximately convex sequence. For a given $\varepsilon&gt;0$; a sequence $\big&lt;u_n\big&gt;_{n=0}^{\infty}$ is said to be $\varepsilon$-convex, if for any $i,j\in\mathbb{N}$ with $i&lt;j$ there exists an $n\in]i,j]\cap \mathbb{N}$ such that the following discrete functional inequality holds \begin{equation*} { u_i-u_{i-1}-\dfrac{\varepsilon}{n-i}\leq u_j-u_{j-1}. } \end{equation*} We show that such a sequence can be represented as the algebraic summation of a convex and a controlled sequence which is bounded in between $\left[-\dfrac{\varepsilon}{2}, \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2}\right].$ On the other hand, if for any $i,j\in\mathbb{N}$ with $i&lt;j$, if a sequence $\big&lt;u_n\big&gt;_{n=0}^{\infty}$ satisfies the following form of inequality \begin{equation*} { \left|\big(u_i-u_{i-1}\big)-\big(u_j-u_{j-1}\big)\right|\leq\dfrac{\varepsilon}{n-i}\quad \quad\mbox{for some} \quad n\in]i,j]\cap\mathbb{N}; } \end{equation*} then we term it as $\varepsilon$-affine sequence. Such a sequence can be decomposed as the algebraic summation of an affine and a bounded sequence whose supremum norm doesn't exceed $\varepsilon.$</description>

      <title>The stability of a biadditive functional equation via a new direct method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing stability in functional equations is a critical task with broad implications across mathematics and its applications. In this paper, we present a novel direct method for proving the stability of the following equation, \begin{eqnarray*} f(x,y)=\alpha f(f_1(x,y))+\beta f(f_2(x,y)) \end{eqnarray*} subjecting to certain constraints on the constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$, as well as the functions $f_1(x,y)$ and $f_2(x,y)$. We introduce the direct method to prove the stability of the following functional equation and inequality, \begin{eqnarray*} \|f(x+y,z-w)+f(x-y,z+w)-2f(x,z)+2f(y,w)\| \leq \|x\|^p\|y\|^p\|z\|^p\|w\|^p; \end{eqnarray*} \begin{eqnarray*} \begin{split} \;&amp;\|f\left(x+y,z-w\right)+af\left(\frac{x-y}{a},z+w\right)-2f(x,z)+2f(y,w) \|\\ \;&amp;\leq \left\| \rho\left(f(x+y,z-w)+f(x-y,z+w)-2f(x,z)+2f(y,w)\right)\right\|. \end{split} \end{eqnarray*} This technique efficiently confirms stability, outperforming traditional proof methods in simplicity and efficacy. The application of our direct approach to various equations solidifies its validity, ensuring stable behavior across different mathematical contexts.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci-Lucas Spinors Obtained from Hybrid Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to provide the contributors to journals or Hybrid numbers, akin to spinors, possess a broad range of applications in mathematical physics, geometry, and mathematics. In this study, these two significant topics were collectively addressed, introducing a new perspective to spinors and defining hybrid spinors, from which several basic properties were derived. Furthermore, by considering the Fibonacci and Lucas number sequences, subjects widely explored in number theory, the study defined hybrid Fibonacci and Lucas spinor sequences, examining some of their properties. Lastly, hybrid Fibonacci and Lucas polynomial spinor sequences have been introduced through the utilization of the polynomials associated with these number sequences.</description>

      <title>Towards Point-Free Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we propose and study a theory of ordered locales, a type of point-free space equipped with a preorder structure on its frame of opens. It is proved that the Stone-type duality between topological spaces and locales lifts to a new adjunction between a certain category of ordered topological spaces and the newly introduced category of ordered locales.
  As an application, we use these techniques to develop point-free analogues of some common aspects from the causality theory of Lorentzian manifolds. In particular, we show that so-called indecomposable past sets in a spacetime can be viewed as the points of the locale of futures. This builds towards a point-free causal boundary construction. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of causal coverage that leads naturally to a generalised notion of Grothendieck topology incorporating the order structure. From this naturally emerges a localic notion of domain of dependence.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the Manhattan distance in $n$-dimensions: Estimating multidimensional scenarios in empirical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding distance metrics in high-dimensional spaces is crucial for various fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and optimization. The Manhattan distance, a fundamental metric in multi-dimensional settings, measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences along each dimension. This study investigates the behavior of Manhattan distance as the dimensionality of the space increases, addressing the question: how does the Manhattan distance between two points change as the number of dimensions n increases?. We analyze the theoretical properties and statistical behavior of Manhattan distance through mathematical derivations and computational simulations using Python. By examining random points uniformly distributed in fixed intervals across dimensions, we explore the asymptotic behavior of Manhattan distance and validate theoretical expectations empirically. Our findings reveal that the mean and variance of Manhattan distance exhibit predictable trends as dimensionality increases, aligning closely with theoretical predictions. Visualizations of Manhattan distance distributions across varying dimensionalities offer intuitive insights into its behavior. This study contributes to the understanding of distance metrics in high-dimensional spaces, providing insights for applications requiring efficient navigation and analysis in multi-dimensional domains.</description>

      <title>On the cyclic 3-manifold covers of the type surface x R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article contains a proof of the fact that, under certain mild technical conditions, the action of the automorphism group of a cyclic 3-manifold cover of the type SxR, where S is a compact surface, yields a compact quotient. This result is then immediately applied to extend a theorem on the fiberings over the circle of certain compact 3-manifolds which are torus sums. As a corollary, I prove the validity of the conditional main theorem in my article titled "A fibering theorem for 3-manifolds", which appeared in the Journal of Groups, Complexity, Cryptology in 2021 and its subsequent erratum. This paper also furnishes a proof of the irreducibility of the summands of compact 3-manifolds which are torus sums and irreducible.</description>
