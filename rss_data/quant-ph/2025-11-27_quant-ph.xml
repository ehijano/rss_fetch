      <title>Centipedes Leap into the Quantum Realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centipede game is a two-player non-zero-sum game. Each turn, a player can choose whether they want to take or pass a growing reward. The classical, rational solution of this game shows defection in the first round, when in reality, players cooperate much more often. Inspired by prior work employing quantum strategies in the prisoners dilemma, we showed that when similar quantum mechanics principles are applied to the centipede game, it leads to two new quantum Nash equilibria that are superior to the classical solution. Furthermore, by implementing our algorithm on Qiskit, we confirmed that leveraging quantum strategies, rather than strategies like backward induction, to solve the centipede game provided better payoffs for both players and more accurately modeled the games real-life outcomes. Ultimately, we propose a generalized conjecture for similarly structured quantum games.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum-Speed Limit for Gaussian Systems and Prospective Experimental Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timing and phase resolution in satellite QKD, kilometre-scale gravitational-wave detectors, and space-borne clock networks hinge on quantum-speed limits (QSLs), yet benchmarks omit relativistic effects for coherent and squeezed probes. We derive first-order relativistic corrections to the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds. Starting from the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion and treating $-p^{4}/(8 m^{3} c^{2})$ as a harmonic-oscillator perturbation, we propagate Gaussian states to obtain closed-form QSLs and the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. Relativistic kinematics slow evolution in an amplitude- and squeezing-dependent way, increase both bounds, and introduce an $\epsilon^{2} t^{2}$ phase drift that weakens timing sensitivity while modestly increasing the squeeze factor. A single electron ($\epsilon \approx 1.5\times 10^{-10}$) in a $5.4\,\mathrm{T}$ Penning trap, read out with $149\,\mathrm{GHz}$ quantum-limited balanced homodyne, should reveal this drift within $\sim 15\,\mathrm{min}$ -- within known hold times. These results benchmark relativistic corrections in continuous-variable systems and point to an accessible test of the quantum speed limit in high-velocity or strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Comment on Classical-Gravity--Quantum-Matter Claims About Gravity-Mediated Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper by Aziz and Howl (Nature 2025) argues that, once quantum matter is described at the level of quantum field theory and coupled to a classical gravitational field, higher order processes can generate entanglement between two spatially separated masses. A contemporaneous critical note (Marletto, Oppenheim, Vedral, Wilson, arXiv:2511.07348v1) shows that, in the actual nonrelativistic limit employed there, the interaction becomes ultra local, the total unitary factorizes, and no entanglement is generated from a product input. In this comment we (i) restate the core point of that critique, (ii) give a channel theoretic reformulation that makes the conclusion model independent, and (iii) clarify the distinction between activation of entanglement in already quantum matter and genuine mediation of entanglement by a classical field. Once these clarifications are in place, the standard BMV inference that observation of gravity mediated entanglement strongly indicates nonclassical gravitational degrees of freedom remains intact.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Phase-Coherence Compensation for Superconducting Qubits Integrated Computational and Hardware Validation of the Aurora Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an emulator-based and hardware feasibility study of Aurora-DD, a phase-coherence compensation method that integrates a sign-based feedback update of a global phase offset (Delta phi) with a fixed-depth XY8 dynamical decoupling (DD) scaffold. The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an "offline closed-loop, online open-loop" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value &lt;Z&gt;, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution. Overall, the combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Inter-system Crossing of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center up to Megabar Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers into diamond anvil cells has opened the door to quantum sensing at megabar pressures. Despite a multitude of experimental demonstrations and applications ranging from quantum materials to geophysics, a detailed microscopic understanding of how stress affects the NV center remains lacking. In this work, using a combination of first principles calculations as well as high-pressure NV experiments, we develop a complete description of the NV's optical properties under general stress conditions. In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes. Our work lays the foundation for optimizing the performance of NV high-pressure sensors by controlling the local stress environment, and more generally, suggests that symmetry-breaking stresses can be utilized as a novel tuning knob for generic solid-state spin defects.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal quantum information processing with superconducting diodes in circuit quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing new components and functionalities into quantum devices is critical in advancing state-of-the-art hardware. Here, we propose superconducting diodes (SDs) as a coherent nonreciprocal element in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures. In particular, we use an asymmetric SQUID as an SD controlled with a flux bias. We spectroscopically characterize SD and show that flux bias acts cooperatively with the nonlinear diode response to induce direction-dependent resonance shifts in the transmission spectrum. We use the SD as an elementary component to realize coherent nonreciprocal qubit-qubit coupling. With a minimal two qubit system, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal half-iSWAP gate with tunable Bell-state generation, thereby showcasing the potential of intrinsic nonreciprocity as a tool in coherent control in quantum technologies. Our work enables high-fidelity signal routing and entanglement generation in all-to-all connected microwave quantum networks, where nonreciprocity is embedded at the device level.</description>

      <title>Multi-Field Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic continuous matrix product states (RCMPS) are a powerful variational ansatz for quantum field theories of a single field. However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line. This makes RCMPS usable for a far larger class of problems than before.</description>

      <title>Real-time Monitoring of Neon Film Growth for Electron-on-Neon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states coupled to superconducting circuits are a promising platform for quantum computing. Control over the formation of these charge states requires techniques to track and control the growth of solid Ne films on the circuit surface. We demonstrate a real-time Ne film-growth monitor using high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) YBCO microwave resonators. The high $T_c$ enables tracking of the film thickness near Ne's triple temperature and below. Across more than 300 solidification experiments, we find that the final Ne thickness varies stochastically from a few nm to a few $\mu$m for films solidified from the liquid phase. By increasing the driving power in the resonator, we consistently reduce the final thickness to below 100 nm. These results represent an important step toward controlled formation of Ne films for eNe qubits and highlight the broader utility of high-$T_c$ resonators for hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges of Computational Electromagnetics Methods for Superconducting Circuit Quantum Device Modeling: A Practical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity numerical methods that model the physical layout of a device are essential for the design of many technologies. For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Zeno sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect typically refers to freezing the dynamics of a quantum system through frequent observations. In general, quantum Zeno dynamics is obtained with an error of order $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$, where $N$ is the number of projective measurements performed within a fixed evolution time. In this work, we develop higher-order Zeno sequences that achieve faster convergence to Zeno dynamics, yielding an improved error scaling of $\mathcal{O}(1/N^{2k})$, where $k$ describes the order of the Zeno sequence. This is achieved by relating higher-order Zeno sequences to higher-order Trotter formulas that achieve similar convergence behavior. We leverage this relation to develop higher-order Zeno sequences for different manifestations of the quantum Zeno effect, including frequent projective measurements and unitary kicks. We go on to discuss achieving quantum Zeno dynamics through periodic control fields of high frequency. We explicitly develop control fields that yield a second-order type improvement in the Zeno error scaling and present shorter Zeno sequences. Finally, we discuss the connection to randomized and Uhrig dynamical decoupling to develop more efficient implementations in the weak coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Entanglement in Solid-State Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation and control of quantum states lie at the heart of quantum information science (QIS). Recent advances in solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) and nanophotonics have transformed the landscape of quantum photonic technologies, enabling scalable generation of quantum states of light and matter. A new frontier in solid-state quantum photonics is the engineering of many-body interactions between QEs and photons to achieve robust coherence and controllable many-body entanglement. These entangled states, including photonic graph and cluster states, superradiant emission, and emergent quantum phases, are promising for quantum computation, sensing, and simulation. However, intrinsic inhomogeneities and decoherence in solid-state platforms pose significant challenges to realize such complex entangled states. This review provides an overview of the fundamental many-body interactions and dynamics at the light-matter interfaces of solid-state QEs, and discusses recent advances in mitigating decoherence and harnessing robust many-body coherence.</description>

      <title>Nonextensive statistics for a 2D electron gas in noncommutative spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian operator in a two dimensional noncommutative space. The system consists of an electron subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, coupled to a harmonic potential and an external electric field $\mathbf{E}$, within the context of non-extensive statistical thermodynamics. The noncommutative geometry introduces a fundamental minimal length that modifies the phase space structure. The thermodynamics of this quantum system is developed within the framework of Tsallis statistics through the derivation of $q$-generalized versions of the partition function, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility, following the application of a generalized Hilhorst transformation adapted to non-commutative geometry. The combined effects of the non-extensivity parameter $q$ and the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$ are analyzed by considering the limit $q \rightarrow 1$, revealing new thermodynamic regimes and anomalous electromagnetic properties specific to quantum systems in non-commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Mode multiplexing for scalable cavity-enhanced operations in neutral-atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays provide a versatile platform for quantum information processing. However, in large-scale arrays, efficient photon collection remains a bottleneck for key tasks such as fast, non-destructive qubit readout and remote entanglement distribution. We propose a cavity-based approach that enables fast, parallel operations over many atoms using multiple modes of a single optical cavity. By selectively shifting the relevant atomic transitions, each atom can be coupled to a distinct cavity mode, allowing independent simultaneous processing. We present practical system designs that support cavity-mode multiplexing with up to 50 modes, enabling rapid mid-circuit syndrome extraction and significantly enhancing entanglement distribution rates between remote atom arrays. This approach offers a scalable solution to core challenges in neutral atom arrays, advancing the development of practical quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Restoring a Missing Meta-Symmetry of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional quantum mechanics, all unitary evolution takes place within the space-time Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{xt}=L^2(\mathcal M_{xt})$, with time as the sole evolution parameter. The momentum-energy representation $\phi(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert. Here we restore the fundamental symmetry between the conjugate pairs $(x,t)$ and $(k,E)$ by extending the quantum theory to an enlarged Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{\text{total}} = \mathcal H_{xt} \oplus \mathcal H_{kE}$, within which the momentum-energy sector $\mathcal H_{kE}=L^2(\mathcal M_{kE})$ carries its own autonomous unitary evolution generated by a self-adjoint operator $\hat{\mathcal T}$. The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity.</description>

      <title>Fusion of classical and quantum kernels enables accurate and robust two-sample tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-sample tests have been extensively employed in various scientific fields and machine learning such as evaluation on the effectiveness of drugs and A/B testing on different marketing strategies to discriminate whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution or not. Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.</description>

      <title>Generalized Heralded Generation of Non-Gaussian States Using an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heralded optical parametric amplifier (OPA) has emerged as a promising tool for quantum state engineering. However, its potential has been limited to coherent state inputs. Here, we introduce a generalized heralded OPA protocol that unlocks a vastly expanded class of quantum phenomena by accepting arbitrary non-classical inputs. With a squeezed vacuum input, the setup functions as an integrated two-photon subtractor, deterministically generating high-fidelity, larger-amplitude squeezed Schr\"odinger cat states -- an operation previously requiring complex, discrete setups. Furthermore, when fed a small-amplitude SC state, the protocol acts as a non-Gaussianity amplifier, distilling it into high-purity approximations of key quantum resources like specific photon-number superpositions. This work transforms the OPA from a specialized source into a versatile and practical platform for advanced quantum state engineering, enabling the generation of a wide array of non-Gaussian states from a single, integrated setup.</description>

      <title>Compilation Pipeline for Predicting Algorithmic Break-Even in an Early-Fault-Tolerant Surface Code Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in realizing surface code on hardware, including demonstrations of break-even logical memory on devices with up to hundreds of physical qubits, has materially advanced the prospects for fault-tolerant quantum computation. This progress creates urgency for the development of compilation workflows that directly target the forthcoming generation of devices with thousands of physical qubits, for which algorithm execution becomes practical. We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our pipeline integrates several open-source software tools, and leverages recent advances in error-aware unitary gate synthesis, high-fidelity magic state production, and the calculation of correlation surfaces in the surface code. We perform classical simulations of physical Clifford proxy circuits produced by our pipeline, and find that both 5-qubit QAOA and QPE can reach algorithmic break-even with 2517 physical qubits (surface code distance $d=11$) at physical error rates of $p=10^{-3}$, or 1737 physical qubits ($d=9$) at $p=5\times 10^{-4}$. Our work thereby identifies conditions for achieving algorithmic break-even with near-term quantum hardware and paves the way towards an end-to-end compiler for early-fault-tolerant surface code architectures.</description>

      <title>Mirror subspace diagonalization: a quantum Krylov algorithm with near-optimal sampling cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a promising approach for ground-state energy estimation in the near-term quantum computing era. A major challenge, however, lies in their inherently substantial sampling cost, primarily due to the individual measurement of each term in the Hamiltonian. While various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the sampling overhead remains a significant bottleneck, especially for practical large-scale electronic structure problems. In this work, we introduce an alternative method, dubbed mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD), which approaches the theoretical lower bound of the sampling cost for quantum Krylov algorithms. MSD leverages a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian operator as a linear combination of time-evolution unitaries with symmetrically shifted timesteps, enabling efficient estimation of the Hamiltonian matrix within the Krylov subspace. In this scheme, the finite difference and statistical errors are simultaneously minimized by optimizing the timestep parameter and shifting the energy spectrum. Consequently, MSD attains the lower bound of the sampling cost of the quantum Krylov algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we employ classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, which are used to mitigate the ground state energy error based on the Lanczos scheme. Through theoretical analysis of the sampling cost, we demonstrate that MSD is particularly effective when the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian is significantly smaller than its 1-norm. Such a situation arises, for example, in high-accuracy simulations of molecules using large basis sets that incorporate strong electronic correlations. Numerical results for various molecular models reveal that MSD can achieve sampling cost reductions ranging from approximately 10 to 10,000 times compared to the conventional quantum Krylov algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multi-path vector entanglement engineering via dark mode control in optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($\phi$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($\phi=\pi/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime. Our work sheets light on new possibilities to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources that are useful for plethora of modern quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Witness wedges in fidelity-deviation plane: separating teleportation advantage and Bell-inequality violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework to analyze $d$-dimensional quantum teleportation through the joint geometry of two complementary figures of merit: average fidelity $F$ (how well a protocol works on average) and fidelity deviation $D$ (how uniformly it works across the inputs). Technically, we formulate a representation-theoretical framework based on Schur-Weyl duality and permutation symmetry calculus that reduce the higher-moment Haar averages to a finite set of trace invariants of the composed correction unitaries. This yields closed-form expressions for $F$ and $D$ in arbitrary Hilbert-space dimension and delivers tight bounds that link the admissible deviation directly to the gap from the optimal average performance. In particular, any measured pair $(F, D)$ can be ported into a visibility estimate for isotropic channel resources, turning the $(F, D)$-plane into a calibrated diagnostic map. We further cast the teleportation advantage and CGLMP-inequality violation as two witnesses lines in the $(F,D)$ plane: one line certifies that $F$ beats the classical benchmark $2/(d{+}1)$, while the other line certifies the Bell nonlocality. Their identical slope but distinct intercepts expose a quantitative gap between "entangled yet local" and "genuinely nonlocal" resources.</description>

      <title>Tip-enhanced quantum-sensing spectroscopy for bright and reconfigurable solid-state single-photon emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom-like defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide room-temperature single-photon emission and coherent spin states, making them attractive for quantum-computing and -sensing applications. However, their random spatial and spectral characteristics hamper deterministic coupling with nano-optical cavities, limiting their use as bright single-photon sources and sensitive quantum sensors. Here, we present tip-enhanced quantum-sensing spectroscopy of single-photon emitters in hBN. Through precise spatial positioning of individual emitters within tip-cavities with different plasmon resonances, we adaptively control the enhancement rates of both excitation and emission, as well as the single-photon purity. In this way, optimal selection of their relative contributions can effectively reconfigure solid-state single-photon sources, with simultaneous nano-spectroscopic space- and time-resolved analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate tip-enhanced quantum-sensing with single spin defects through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments in tip-coupled hBN nanoflakes. Our approach provides a unique pathway toward highly-sensitive and deterministic quantum-sensing with room-temperature single-photon emitters.</description>

      <title>Vortex-Enhanced Zitterbewegung in Relativistic Electron Wave Packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zitterbewegung (ZBW), the trembling motion predicted by the Dirac equation, has long remained unobservable in free electrons due to its sub-Compton scale. We elaborately construct a relativistic vortex electron wave packet as a coherent superposition of both positive- and negative-energy Dirac states and derive their space-time dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that introducing orbital angular momentum provides a mechanism for amplifying the ZBW amplitude far beyond that of conventional Gaussian packets, while maintaining coherence. The resulting relativistic vortex states unify Gaussian and Bessel-Gaussian models within a single framework and opens new possibilities for observing relativistic quantum dynamics in structured electron wave packets.</description>

      <title>Geometric Entanglement Entropy on Projective Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement for pure bipartite states is most commonly quantified in a state-by-state manner to each pure state of a bipartite system a scalar quantity, such as the von Neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix. This provides a precise local characterization of how entangled a given state is. At the same time, this local description naturally invites a set of complementary, more global questions about the structure of the space of pure states: How abundant are the states with a given amount of entanglement within the full state space? Do the manifolds of constant entanglement exhibit distinct geometric regimes? These questions shift the focus from assigning an entanglement value to a single state to understanding the global organization and geometry of entanglement across the entire manifold of pure states.
  In this work, we develop a geometric framework in which these questions become natural. We regard the projective Hilbert space of pure states, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, as a Riemannian manifold and promote bipartite entanglement to a macroscopic functional on this manifold. Its level sets stratify the space of pure states into hypersurfaces of constant entanglement, and we define a geometric entanglement entropy as the log-volume of these hypersurfaces, weighted by the Fubini-Study gradient of entanglement. This quantity plays the role of a microcanonical entropy in entanglement space: it measures the degeneracy of a given entanglement value in the natural quantum geometry.
  The framework is illustrated first in the simplest case of a single spin-1/2 and then for bipartite entanglement of spin systems, including a two-qubit example where explicit calculations can be carried out, along with a sketch of the extension to spin chains.</description>

      <title>Phase Estimation with Compressed Controlled Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many optimally scaling quantum simulation algorithms employ controlled time evolution of the Hamiltonian, which is typically the major bottleneck for their efficient implementation. This work establishes a compression protocol for encoding the controlled time evolution operator of translationally invariant, local Hamiltonians into a quantum circuit. It achieves a near-optimal scaling in circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(t \text{ polylog}(t N/\epsilon))$, while reducing the control overhead from a multiplicative to an additive factor. We report that this compression protocol enables the implementation of Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation with as few as 414 CNOT gates for a frustrated quantum spin system on a 6x6 triangular lattice and delivers ground state energy errors below 1% (with $\pm$ 1.5% variation, calculated with a hardware noise aware pipeline) on a 4x4 triangular lattice using the noisy emulator of the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a cost-effective quantum error mitigation technique that builds on the recent Ansatz-based gate and readout error mitigation method (M0). The technique, tiled M0, leverages the unique structure of tiled Ans\"atze (e.g., tUPS, QNP, hardware-efficient circuits) to apply a locality approximation to M0 that results in an exponential reduction in the QPU cost of the noise characterization. We validate the technique for molecular ground state energy calculations with the tUPS Ansatz on LiH, molecular hydrogen, water, butadiene, and benzene ($4-12$ qubits), demonstrating little to no loss in accuracy compared to M0 in noisy simulations. We also show the performance of the technique in quantum experiments, highlighting its potential use in near-term applications.</description>

      <title>The effects of decoherence on Fermi's golden rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule which describes the transition rates between two electronic levels under external stimulations is used ubiquitously in different fields of physics. The original Fermi's golden rule was derived from perturbative time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger's equation without the direct contribution by decoherence effect. However, as a result of recent developments of quantum computing and ultra fast carrier dynamics, the decoherence becomes a prominent topic in fundamental research.Here, by using the non-adiabatic molecular dynamics which goes beyond the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger's equation by introducing decoherence, we study the effect of decoherence on Fermi's golden rule for the fixed basis and the adiabatic basis, respectively. We find that when the decoherence time becomes short, there is a significant deviation from the Fermi's golden rule for both bases. By using monolayer $\mathrm{WS_2}$ as an example, we investigate the decoherence effect in the carrier transitions induced by the electron-phonon coupling with first-principle method.</description>

      <title>Finite-key security analysis of the decoy-state BB84 QKD with passive measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decoy-state Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol is widely regarded as the de facto standard for practical implementations. On the receiver side, passive basis choice is attractive because it significantly reduces the need for random number generators and eliminates the need for optical modulators. Despite these advantages, a finite-key analytical security proof for the decoy-state BB84 protocol, where the basis is chosen passively with a biased probability, has been lacking. In this work, we present a simple analytical finite-key security proof for this setting, yielding a closed-form secret-key rate formula that can be directly evaluated using experimentally accessible parameters. Numerical simulations show that the key rates of passiveand active-measurement implementations are nearly identical, indicating that passive measurement does not compromise key-generation efficiency in practical QKD systems.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Agreement Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and prove an Agreement Theorem for quantum mechanics (QM), describing when two agents, represented by separate laboratories, can or cannot maintain differing probability estimates of a shared quantum property of interest. Building on the classical framework (Aumann, 1976), we define the modality of "common certainty" through a hierarchy of certainty operators acting on each agent's Hilbert space. In the commuting case -- when all measurements and event projectors commute -- common certainty leads to equality of the agents' conditional probabilities, recovering a QM analog of the classical theorem. By contrast, when non-commuting operators are allowed, the certainty recursion can stabilize with different probabilities. This yields common certainty of disagreement (CCD) as a distinctive QM phenomenon. Agreement is restored once measurement outcomes are recorded in a classical register. The classical Agreement Theorem can therefore be seen as emergent from the quantum world via recording. We establish an impossibility result stating that QM forbids a scenario where one agent is certain that a property of interest occurs, and is also certain that the other agent is certain that the property does not occur. In this sense, QM admits non-classical disagreement, but disagreement is still bounded in a disciplined way. We argue that our analysis offers a rigorous approach to the longstanding issue of how to understand intersubjectivity across agents in QM.</description>

Abstract: Permutation symmetry plays a central role in the understanding of collective quantum dynamics. On the other hand, interactions are rarely uniform in real systems. By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $\alpha$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $\alpha$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $\alpha=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $\alpha$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $\alpha=0$, we find that for small $\alpha$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $\alpha=0$. At intermediate $\alpha$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $\alpha$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $\tau$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $\alpha$ when $\tau$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $\alpha$. We further confirm these results using effective dimension and spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Large-scale portfolio optimization using Pauli Correlation Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a cornerstone of financial decision-making, traditionally relying on classical algorithms to balance risk and return. Recent advances in quantum computing offer a promising alternative, leveraging quantum algorithms to efficiently explore complex solution spaces and potentially outperform classical methods in high-dimensional settings. However, conventional quantum approaches typically assume a one-to-one correspondence between qubits and variables (e.g. financial assets), which severely limits the applicability of gate-based quantum systems due to current hardware constraints. As a result, only quantum annealing-like methods have been used in realistic scenarios. In this work, we show how a gate-based variational quantum algorithm can be applied to a real-world portfolio optimization problem by assigning multiple variables per qubit. Specifically, we address a problem involving over 250 variables, where the market graph representing a real stock market is iteratively partitioned into sub-portfolios of highly correlated assets. This approach enables improved scalability compared to traditional variational methods and opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced financial applications.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Generalised Born Rule from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A basic postulate of modern compositional approaches to generalised physical theories is the generalised Born rule, in which probabilities are postulated to be computable from the composition of states and effects. In this paper we consider whether this postulate, and the strength of the identification between scalars and probabilities, can be argued from basic principles. To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds. We proceed to consider introduction of noise into any such theory, and observe that the result of doing so is a strengthening of the identification between scalars and probabilities; from bare monoid homomorphisms to semiring isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Excited core-level dependence of entanglement between a photoelectron and an emitted X-ray photon in X-ray inner-shell excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated how the quantum entanglement between the spin of the photoelectron and the polarization of the emitted X-ray photon depends on the excited core-level, using the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ and 3$d\rightarrow\ $3$p$ SPR-XEPECS (spin- and polarization-resolved XEPECS) processes for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$-type system, and the 4$f\rightarrow\ $4$d$ SPR-XEPECS process for $\rm CeF_{3}$-type system. In the calculation for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$-type system, we used $\rm TiO_{6}$ cluster model with the full-multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. For $\rm CeF_{3}$-type system, we used ionic model with the full-multiplet structure of the Ce ion. We found two distinct mechanisms for entanglement generation in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ and 4$f\rightarrow\ $4$d$ cases. The first is generated by the spin-orbit interaction of the 2$p$ core electron, whereas the second is generated by the spin-orbit interaction of the 4$f$ valence electron and strong exchange interaction between the 4$f$ and 4$d$ electrons. However, in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $3$p$ case with the strong 3$d-$3$p$ exchange interaction, we found that the entanglement is not generated due to the crystal field effect. These results reveal the existence of two distinct mechanisms for entanglement generation in X-ray inner-shell excitation processes.</description>

      <title>Phase-Dependent Photon Emission Rates in Quantum Gravity-Induced Entangled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, as one of the fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics, has garnered significant attention over the past few decades for its extraordinary nonlocality. With the advancement of quantum technology, quantum entanglement holds promising application for exploring fundamental physical theories. The experimental scheme of Quantum Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) was proposed to investigate the quantum effects of gravity based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theory. In this study, we analyze the quantum properties of the entangled final states generated in the QGEM scheme. Our findings reveal that the photon emission rates (transition rates) are closely related to the degree of entanglement. Specifically, the transition rate decreases as the degree of entanglement increases when the distance between particle pairs is small, then it gradually approaches an asymptotic value that is independent of entanglement as the distance increases. We then discuss the possibility of using photon emission rates to detect quantum entanglement with these results.</description>

      <title>Quantum electrodynamic description of the neutral hydrogen molecule ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionization dynamics of a hydrogen molecule, serving as a fundamental benchmark in quantum chemistry, is investigated within a comprehensive framework combining quantum electrodynamics and the Lindblad master equation. This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\rm{H}_2\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($\gamma_\Omega$), electrons ($\gamma_e$), and phonons ($\gamma_\omega$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $\gamma_\Omega$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($\mu_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\rm{H},\rm{H}\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization. This study provides a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question about the existence of so-called ``hidden'' variables in quantum mechanics and the perception of the completeness of quantum mechanics are two sides of the same coin. Quantum analytical mechanics constitutes a completion of standard quantum mechanics based on the concept of stochastic trajectories in the configuration space of a quantum system. For particle systems, configuration space is made up out of their coordinates and, if relevant, their orientation. Quantum analytical mechanics derives equations of motion for these variables which allow a description of the measurement process as a dynamical physical process. After all, it is exactly these variables experiments are designed to interact with. The theory is not a replacement of Hilbert space quantum mechanics but a mathematical completion enriching our toolset for the description of quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or quantum magic, presents a valuable resource in quantum error correction and computation. We study the dynamics of locally injected magic in unitary Clifford circuits, where the total magic is conserved. However, the absence of physical observables quantifying magic precludes a direct microscopic or hydrodynamic description of its local distribution and dynamics. Using insights from stabilizer quantum error correcting codes, we rigorously show that the spatial distribution of magic can be inferred from a canonical representation of low-magic states, dubbed the bipartite magic gauge. Moreover, we propose two operationally relevant magic length scales. We numerically establish that, at early times, both length scales grow ballistically at distinct velocities set by the entanglement velocity, after which magic delocalizes. Our work sheds light on the spatiotemporal structure of quantum resources and complexity in many-body dynamics, opening up avenues for investigating their transport properties and further connections with quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of electrically levitated nanoparticle-ion systems: Motional dynamics and sympathetic cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter denotes a system of particles immersed in an external environment, from which the particles extract energy continuously in order to perform motion. Extending the paradigm of active matter to a quantum framework requires an open quantum system description. In this work, we consider a driven quantum particle whose external driving exhibits characteristics of classical activity. We model the dynamics with time-local master equations and analyze the particle motion at different time scales for different forms of the master equations. By systematically comparing several types of master equations, we uncover how the particle motion evolves under the interplay of quantum effects and active-like dynamics. These results are essential for guiding possible experiments aimed at realizing quantum analogues of classical active systems.</description>

      <title>Metastability in the Dissipative Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissipative quantum Rabi model exhibits rich non-equilibrium physics, including a dissipative phase transition from the normal phase to the superradiant phase. In this work, we investigate the stability of the superradiant phase in the presence of a weak spin relaxation. We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state. Such dynamical processes lead to a finite lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states and restore the symmetry in the steady state. To substantiate these results, we combine mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses with exact numerical simulations. The lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states are analyzed in finite-size systems, and the conclusions are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via finite-size scaling. Our findings establish the metastable nature of the symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and reveal the complexity of the dissipative phase transition beyond their equilibrium counterpart. The mechanisms uncovered here can be generalized to a broad class of open quantum systems, highlighting fundamental distinctions between equilibrium phase transitions and steady-state phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Latent Gauge and Coherence Selective Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hidden U(1) gauge interaction that couples exclusively to quantum coherence in massive systems. The central innovation is a conserved coherence current operator constructed from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining. This current vanishes for classical matter distributions but is nonzero for spatial superpositions and entangled states, yielding a gauge interaction that is dormant in classical regimes but activated by quantum coherence. The framework predicts three distinctive signatures: (i) interferometric phase shifts scaling linearly with fringe visibility, (ii) decoherence rates with characteristic m^2 scaling and spatial dependence distinct from collapse models, and (iii) entanglement-selective forces between distant massive qubits. The theory maintains full gauge invariance, causality, and positive time evolution. We show that state-of-the-art atom interferometers and levitated nanoparticles can place first constraints on this interaction class, complementary to classical fifth-force searches. This approach provides a novel theoretical framework for probing coherence-selective fundamental interactions and their potential role in the quantum-classical transition. To make this more concrete, we also spell out a simple benchmark latent-field model and work out, in detail, how a representative large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer constrains the corresponding coupling strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new way of deriving classical mechanics from quantum mechanics. A key feature of the method is its compatibility with the standard approach used to derive transition rates between quantum states due to interactions. We apply the developed method to derive the main formulas of physical kinetics. We observe that, through the Liouville equation, we can deduce the non-collision part of the Boltzmann equation, and that, through the matrix of transition rates, we can deduce the collision integral. As a final result of the manuscript, we derive the Boltzmann equation from the Schr\"odinger equation as a single piece of formal mathematical manipulation, without any non-rigorous plausible reasoning used to glue together its different parts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks, the quantum analogue to the classical random walk, have been shown to model fluid dynamics. Neutral atom hardware is a promising choice of platform for implementing quantum walks due to its ability to implement native multiqubit ($\geq\!3$-qubit) gates and to dynamically re-arrange qubits. Using error modelling for multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid passage, we present the gate sequences and predicted final state fidelities for some toy quantum walks, including `lazy' quantum walks. These `lazy' quantum walks include a rest state and therefore provide an integral step towards quantum walks for fluid simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Versatile, tunable, and potentially scalable single-photon sources are a key asset in emergent photonic quantum technologies. In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order correlation measurement, revealing a $g^{(2)}(\tau=0)$ value of 0.3. A detailed analysis of the spectrally selective, cavity enhanced emission features shows the impact of a pronounced acoustic phonon emission sideband, which contributes specifically to the non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling in this system. The achieved level of cavity-emitter control highlights the potential of open-cavity systems to tailor the emission properties of atomically thin quantum emitters, advancing their suitability for real-world quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Factorisation conditions and causality for local measurements in QFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum operations that are perfectly admissible in non-relativistic quantum theory can enable signalling between spacelike separated regions when naively imported into quantum field theory (QFT). Prominent examples of such "impossible measurements", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in "impossible measurement" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators.</description>

      <title>Rapid ground state energy estimation with a Sparse Pauli Dynamics-enabled Variational Double Bracket Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground state energy estimation for strongly correlated quantum systems remains a central challenge in computational physics and chemistry. While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique originally developed for classical simulation of quantum circuits, to efficiently approximate ground state energies. By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG. For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced. These results demonstrate that classical simulation techniques developed in the context of quantum advantage benchmarking can provide practical tools for many-body physics.</description>

      <title>FPGA-tailored algorithms for real-time decoding of quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing but likely requires specialized hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), whose parallelism can alter relative algorithmic performance. We analyze FPGA-tailored versions of three decoder classes for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes: message passing, ordered statistics, and clustering. For message passing, we analyze the recently introduced Relay decoder and its FPGA implementation; for ordered statistics decoding (OSD), we introduce a filtered variant that concentrates computation on high-likelihood fault locations; and for clustering, we design an FPGA-adapted generalized union-find decoder. We design a systolic algorithm for Gaussian elimination on rank-deficient systems that runs in linear parallel time, enabling fast validity checks and local corrections in clustering and eliminating costly full-rank inversion in filtered-OSD. Despite these improvements, both remain far slower and less accurate than Relay, suggesting message passing is the most viable route to real-time qLDPC decoding.</description>

      <title>Finite Size Analysis of Decoy-State BB84 with Advantage Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advantage Distillation (AD) is a classical post-processing technique that enhances Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols by increasing the maximum acceptable Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and thus extending the distance at which QKD links can be securely established. AD operates by post-selecting blocks of bits and extracting fewer high-fidelity bits, exhibiting a reduced QBER and thus lowering the amount of information that has to be disclosed during the information reconciliation step. In this work we present the first comprehensive finite key-size analysis of decoy-state BB84 enhanced via AD post-processing. We demonstrate that through the use of AD the maximum acceptable QBER increases from around $9.5\%$ to around $17.3\%$ for realistic key sizes. This result shows that substantial performance enhancements can be achieved in scenarios which are constrained by the maximum tolerable QBER via improvements of the post-processing method alone.</description>

      <title>Holographically Emergent Gauge Theory in Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel holographic framework for mixed-state phases in random quantum circuits, both unitary and non-unitary, with a global symmetry $G$. Viewing the circuit as a tensor network, we decompose it into two parts: a symmetric layer, which defines an emergent gauge wavefunction in one higher dimension, and a random non-symmetric layer, which consists of random multiplicity tensors. For unitarity circuits, the bulk gauge state is deconfined, but under a generic non-unitary circuit (e.g. channels), the bulk gauge theory can undergo a decoherence-induced phase transition: for $G\,{=}\,\mathbb{Z}_N$ with local symmetric noise, the circuit can act as a quantum error-correcting code with a distinguished logical subspace inheriting the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-surface code's topological protection. We then identify that the charge sharpening transition from the measurement side is complementary to a decodability transition in the bulk: noise of the bulk can be interpreted as measurement from the environment. For $N\,{\leq}\,4$, weak measurements drive a single transition from a charge-fuzzy phase with sharpening time $t_{\#}\sim e^{L}$ to a charge-sharp phase with $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, corresponding to confinement that destroys logical information. For $N&gt;4$, measurements generically generate an intermediate quasi-long-range ordered Coulomb phase with gapless photons and purification time $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(L)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical analyses of intertwined phase transitions in odd-mass Nb isotopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in odd-mass Nb isotopes are investigated in the framework of the interacting boson-fermion model with configuration mixing. A quantum analysis reveals a Type I QPT (gradual shape-evolution within the intruder configuration) superimposed on a Type II QPT (abrupt crossing of normal and intruder states), thus demonstrating the occurrence of intertwined QPTs. A classical analysis highlights the implications for the single particle motion in the deformed field generated by the even-even Zr cores.</description>

      <title>Baby universe as logical qubits: information recovery in random encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit whether a semiclassical baby universe in AdS/CFT necessarily possess a trivial one-dimensional Hilbert space or may instead carry a large entropy. Recent results on Haar random encoding suggest a breakdown of complementary recovery, in which no logical operators can be reconstructed from individual bipartite subsystems. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent dynamics of quasiclassical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors II: Potentials with non-degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the exact quantization of general one-dimensional potentials in view of the exact-WKB formalism. Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a superresolution technique that combines spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) with emitter blinking. We show that temporal fluctuations not only enhance the precision of SPADE imaging, but also drastically simplify the measurement required to recover full object information -- in the presence of fluctuations, SPADE can be replaced by the much simpler image inversion interferometry. Both gains are enabled by exploiting temporal cumulants of the detected signal.</description>

      <title>Defect Bootstrap: Tight Ground State Bounds in Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of bootstrap methods based on semidefinite relaxations of positivity constraints has enabled rigorous two-sided bounds on local observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tungsten Germanide Single-Photon Detectors with Saturated Internal Detection Efficiency at Wavelengths up to 29 {\mu}m</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are among the most sensitive single-photon detectors available and have the potential to transform fields ranging from infrared astrophysics to molecular spectroscopy. However, extending their performance into the mid-infrared spectral region - crucial for applications such as exoplanet transit spectroscopy and vibrational fingerprinting of molecules - has remained a major challenge, primarily due to material limitations and scalability constraints. Here, we report on the development of SNSPDs based on tungsten germanide, a novel material system that combines high infrared sensitivity with compatibility for large-scale fabrication. Our detectors exhibit saturated internal detection efficiency at wavelengths up to 29 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. This advance enables scalable, high-performance single-photon detection in a spectral region that was previously inaccessible, opening new frontiers in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, molecular physics, and astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleation and wetting transitions are studied in a three-component Bose-Einstein condensate mixture within Gross-Pitaevskii theory. For special cases of intermediate segregation between components 1 and 2, the nucleation phase transition of a surfactant film of component 3 is obtained by exact solution. Additional exact results for the nucleation transition are derived in the limit of strong segregation between components 1 and 2. In this limit the exact first-order wetting phase boundary is obtained using analytical and numerical methods, and is contrasted with the exact nucleation and wetting phase boundary derived previously for a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate mixture at a hard optical wall. Exact results for the three-component mixture are compared with results from the double-parabola approximation used in an earlier work.</description>

      <title>New quasi-exatly solvable systems from SUSYQM and Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a systematic construction of new quasi-exactly solvable systems via Bethe ansatz and supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schr\"odinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>Unconventional orders in the maple-leaf ferro-antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the search for unconventional orders in frustrated quantum magnets, we present a multi-method investigation into the nature of the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice with three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor interactions. It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.</description>

      <title>Dichroism from Thermoelectric Chiral Drives: Generalized Sum Rules for Orbital and Heat Magnetizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</description>

      <title>Consistent circuits for indefinite causal order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a number of quantum processes have been proposed which are logically consistent, yet feature a cyclic causal structure. However, there is no general formal method to construct a process with an exotic causal structure in a way that ensures, and makes clear why, it is consistent. Here we provide such a method, given by an extended circuit formalism. This only requires directed graphs endowed with Boolean matrices, which encode basic constraints on operations. Our framework (a) defines a set of elementary rules for checking the validity of any such graph, (b) provides a way of constructing consistent processes as a circuit from valid graphs, and (c) yields an intuitive interpretation of the causal relations within a process and an explanation of why they do not lead to inconsistencies. We display how several standard examples of exotic processes, including ones that violate causal inequalities, are among the class of processes that can be generated in this way; we conjecture that this class in fact includes all unitarily extendible processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10270v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.</description>

      <title>Coupling Enhancement and Symmetrization in Dissipative Optomechanical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing single-photon optomechanical effects remains a significant challenge in cavity optomechanics. To investigate intrinsic optomechanical nonlinear effects at the single-photon level, it is essential to strengthen the interaction between a single photon and a finite number of phonons. In this work, we enhance the optomechanical coupling by introducing a two-laser driving scheme together with a second-order nonlinear contribution to the cavity resonance frequency, which overtakes the original radiation-pressure nonlinearity as the dominant part in a prototypical Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity. By properly tuning the two driving lasers and the cross-Kerr interaction so that the effective coupling becomes real, we theoretically establish a symmetric optomechanical model at the single-photon level where photon and phonon mode fluctuations exhibit identical dynamics. Within this framework, we analyze the optimal reciprocal transport of the input laser field. Through examination of the optimal signal transmission, we identify the critical boundary associated with the onset of the strong-coupling regime. Additionally, we compare the optical signal scattering behavior in both dissipative equilibrium and nonequilibrium symmetric optomechanical systems, with and without non-rotating-wave contributions. Our work achieves controllable enhancement of the optomechanical coupling and enables optimal signal transfer even in the ultrastrong-coupling regime, suggesting a promising route toward tunable single-photon optomechanical functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a wide class of random quantum channels with few Kraus operators, sampled as random matrices with some sparsity and moment assumptions, typically exhibit a large spectral gap, and are therefore optimal quantum expanders. In particular, our result provides a recipe to construct random quantum expanders from their classical (random or deterministic) counterparts. This considerably enlarges the list of known constructions of optimal quantum expanders, which was previously limited to few examples. Our proofs rely on recent progress in the study of the operator norm of random matrices with dependence and non-homogeneity, which we expect to have further applications in several areas of quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08971v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adopting general frameworks for quantum-classical dynamics, we analyze the interaction between quantum matter and a classical gravitational field. We point out that, assuming conservation of momentum or energy, and assuming that the dynamics obeys Hamiltonian formalism or a particular decomposition property set out in the paper, the classical gravitational field cannot change the momentum or energy of the quantum system, whereas the quantum gravitational field can do so. Drawing upon the fundamental relationship between conservation laws and the quantum properties of objects, our analysis offers new perspectives for the study of quantum gravity and provides a novel interpretation of existing experimental observations, such as free fall.</description>

      <title>On Split-State Quantum Tamper Detection and Non-Malleability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tamper-detection codes (TDCs) are fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. A TDC encodes messages in such a manner that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output the original message, or reject it. In this work, we study quantum analogs of one of the most well-studied adversarial tampering models: the so-called $t$-split-state tampering model, where the codeword is divided into $t$ shares, and each share is tampered with "locally".
  It is impossible to achieve tamper detection in the split-state model using classical codewords. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the situation changes significantly if the message can be encoded into a multipartite quantum state, entangled across the $t$ shares. Concretely, we define a family of quantum TDCs defined on any $t\geq 3$ shares, which can detect arbitrary split-state tampering so long as the adversaries are unentangled, or even limited to a finite amount of pre-shared entanglement. Previously, this was only known in the limit of asymptotically large $t$.
  As our flagship application, we show how to augment threshold secret sharing schemes with similar tamper-detecting guarantees. We complement our results by establishing connections between quantum TDCs and quantum encryption schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiofrequency (RF) traps enable highly controlled interactions between charged particles, including reactions between cold molecular ions, sympathetic cooling of one ion species with another, and quantum logic spectroscopy. However, the charge-to-mass ($Q/m$) selectivity of RF traps limits the range of objects that can be confined simultaneously in the same trap. Here, we confine two particles - a nanoparticle and an atomic ion - in the same radiofrequency trap although their charge-to-mass ratios differ by six orders of magnitude. The confinement is enabled by a dual-frequency voltage applied to the trap electrodes. We introduce a robust loading procedure under ultra-high vacuum and characterize the stability of both particles. It is observed that slow-field micromotion, an effect specific to the dual-field setting, plays a crucial role for ion localization. Our results lay the groundwork for controlled interactions between diverse charged particles, regardless of the difference in their charge or mass, with applications from antimatter synthesis to the generation of macroscopic quantum states of motion.</description>

      <title>Analytical Lower Bound on Query Complexity for Transformations of Unknown Unitary Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07625v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments have revealed deterministic and exact protocols for performing complex conjugation, inversion, and transposition of a general $d$-dimensional unknown unitary operation using a finite number of queries to a black-box unitary operation. In this work, we establish analytical lower bounds for the query complexity of unitary inversion, transposition, and complex conjugation, which hold even if the input unitary is an unknown logarithmic-depth unitary. Specifically, our lower bound of $d^2$ for unitary inversion demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of the deterministic exact inversion protocol, which operates with $O(d^2)$ queries. We introduce a novel framework utilizing differentiation to derive these lower bounds on query complexity for general differentiable functions $f: \mathrm{SU}(d)\to \mathrm{SU}(d)$. As a corollary, we prove that a catalytic protocol -- a new concept recently noted in the study of exact unitary inversion -- is impossible for unitary complex conjugation. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the partially known setting, where the input unitary operation is promised to be within a subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ and the probabilistic setting, where transformations succeed probabilistically.</description>

      <title>A Catalyst Framework for the Quantum Linear System Problem via the Proximal Point Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving systems of linear equations is a fundamental problem, but it can be computationally intensive for classical algorithms in high dimensions. Existing quantum algorithms can achieve exponential speedups for the quantum linear system problem (QLSP) in terms of the problem dimension, but the advantage is bottlenecked by condition number of the coefficient matrix. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for QLSP inspired by the classical proximal point algorithm (PPA). Our proposed method can be viewed as a meta-algorithm that allows inverting a modified matrix via an existing \texttt{QLSP\_solver}, thereby directly approximating the solution vector instead of approximating the inverse of the coefficient matrix. By carefully choosing the step size $\eta$, the proposed algorithm can effectively precondition the linear system to mitigate the dependence on condition numbers that hindered the applicability of previous approaches. Importantly, this is the first iterative framework for QLSP where a tunable parameter $\eta$ and initialization $x_0$ allows controlling the trade-off between the runtime and approximation error.</description>

      <title>Quantum Programming Without the Quantum Physics</title>

Abstract: We propose a quantum programming paradigm where all data are familiar classical data, and the only non-classical element is a random number generator that can return results with negative probability. Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum property testing in sparse directed graphs, and more particularly in the unidirectional model, where the algorithm is allowed to query only the outgoing edges of a vertex. In the classical unidirectional model, the problem of testing $k$-star-freeness, and more generally $k$-source-subgraph-freeness, is almost maximally hard for large $k$. We prove that this problem has almost quadratic advantage in the quantum setting. Moreover, we show that this advantage is nearly tight, by showing a quantum lower bound using the method of dual polynomials on an intermediate problem for a new, property testing version of the $k$-collision problem that was not studied before.
  To illustrate that not all problems in graph property testing admit such a quantum speedup, we consider the problem of $3$-colorability in the related undirected bounded-degree model, when graphs are now undirected. This problem is maximally hard to test classically, and we show that also quantumly it requires a linear number of queries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show topological configurations of the complex-valued spectra in gapped non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive EPs in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that is protected by an energy gap in the spectrum. Their presence or absence establishes topologically distinct configurations for fully non-degenerate systems and tuning between them requires a closing of the gap, forming exceptional point degeneracies. We provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Time-Evolving Block Decimation for Improved Quantum Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating a MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.</description>

      <title>Noisy initial-state qubit-channel metrology with additional undesirable noisy evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider protocols for estimating the parameter in a single-parameter unital qubit channel, assuming that the available initial states are highly mixed with very low purity. We compare two protocols, each invoking the channel once, via their quantum Fisher informations. One uses $n$ qubits prepared in a particular correlated input state and subsequently queries the channel on one qubit. The other uses a single qubit. We extend the results of Collins [1] by allowing for additional noisy evolution on the spectator qubits in the $n$-qubit protocol. We provide simple algebraic expressions that will determine when the $n$-qubit protocol is superior. We provide a technique that can alleviate certain types of noise. We show that for certain types of noisy evolution the $n$-qubit protocol will be inferior but for others it will be superior.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Superstate Quantum Mechanics (SQM), a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints, with ``energy'' also expressed as a quadratic function of these states. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization with energy expressed as a quadratic form involving the Hamiltonian. When SQM represents states as unitary operators, the stationary problem becomes a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in physics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Any stationary SQM problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The non-stationary SQM problem considers the evolution of the system itself, involving the same ``energy'' operator as in the stationary case. Two possible options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered: (1) within the framework of linear maps from higher-order quantum theory, where 2D-type quantum circuits transform one quantum system into another; and (2) in the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii-type nonlinear map. Although no known physical process currently describes such 2D dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithms. As an immediately available practical application of the theory, we consider using a quantum channel as a classical computational model; this type of computation can be performed on a classical computer.</description>

      <title>Alternative Framework to Quantize Fermionic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is augmented to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that leads to the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian can generate the Poincar\'{e} algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. Concrete calculation of the probability of particle creation for the fermionic field under the influence of constant external field confirms that the results agree with those using standard canonical quantization. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-partite entanglement, which focus on at most how many particles in the global system are entangled but separable from other particles, is complementary to the $k$-entanglement that reflects how many splitted subsystems are entangled under partitions of the systems in characterizing multipartite entanglement. Very recently, the theory of the complete $k$-entanglement measure has been established in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 012405 (2024)]. Here we investigate whether we can define the complete measure of the $k$-partite entanglement. Consequently, with the same spirit as that of the complete $k$-entanglement measure, we present the axiomatic postulates that a complete $k$-partite entanglement measure should require. Furthermore, we present two classes of $k$-partite entanglement measures and show that one is complete while the other one is unified but not complete except for the case of $k=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat engines near the adiabatic limit typically assume a working medium at thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body systems often showcase conservation laws that hinder thermalization, leading to prethermalization in exotic stationary phases. This work explores whether prethermalization enhances or reduces engine efficiency. We investigate Otto cycles in quantum systems with varying numbers of conserved quantities. We find that additional conservation laws reduce efficiency at positive temperatures, but enhance it in regimes of negative temperatures. Our findings stem from general thermodynamic inequalities for infinitesimal cycles, and we provide evidence for integrable models undergoing finite cycles using the theoretical framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics. The relevance of our results for quantum simulators is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating data qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the metastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable state without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$ ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit. These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the architecture.</description>

      <title>How to be an orthodox quantum mechanic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to that normally used. Rather than surveying physicists, or poring over the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we review a collection of 42 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 13 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints, but also shows some interesting emerging deviations. Moreover, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense the orthodoxy down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has three consistent pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states, these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles, and quantum systems do not have definite properties prior to measurement. More fully, it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently induces random changes in its state, manifesting as a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gentle measurements of quantum states do not entirely collapse the initial state. Instead, they provide a post-measurement state at a prescribed trace distance $\alpha$ from the initial state together with a random variable used for quantum learning of the initial state. We introduce here the class of $\alpha-$locally-gentle measurements ($\alpha-$LGM) on a finite dimensional quantum system which are product measurements on product states and prove a strong quantum Data-Processing Inequality (qDPI) on this class using an improved relation between gentleness and quantum differential privacy. We further show a gentle quantum Neyman-Pearson lemma which implies that our qDPI is asymptotically optimal (for small $\alpha$). This inequality is employed to show that the necessary number of quantum states for prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$ is of order $1/(\epsilon^2 \alpha^2)$ for both quantum tomography and quantum state certification. Finally, we propose an $\alpha-$LGM called quantum Label Switch that attains these bounds. It is a general implementable method to turn any two-outcome measurement into an $\alpha-$LGM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11576v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $&gt;90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits. This error detection also enables Rydberg qubit evolution with an effective lifetime of $1.2(2)$ ms, enhancing the fidelity of the observed many-body dynamics. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</description>

Abstract: False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of early Universe cosmology and high energy physics, yet its real-time dynamics is essentially inaccessible to classical computation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</description>

      <title>Improved energy barrier in higher-dimensional hypergraph product codes</title>

Abstract: Single-shot error correction outperforms conventional approaches by requiring only one round of stabilizer measurements for decoding, even in the presence of measurement errors. This capability relates to the confinement property of codes, which provides an energy barrier lower bound. Earlier research established a confinement property for higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HHGP) codes (Quintavalle et al. 2021 PRX Quantum), yielding an energy barrier lower bound for these codes. In this work, by analyzing the structure of logical operators, we show an improved energy barrier lower bound for HHGP codes with low-density parity-check (LDPC) property. Our bound exceeds results derived from confinement alone, and unlike standard hypergraph product codes, these higher dimensional variants can possess macroscopic energy barriers even when the underlying classical codes lack this property. Specifically, our analysis shows that the energy barrier of LDPC HHGP codes is lower bounded by the distance of the underlying classical codes. This bound is tight if the underlying classical codes exhibit system size-dependent distances but constant energy barriers, like 3D and 4D toric codes.</description>

      <title>Trion quantum coherence in site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-Lambda{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for the solution of a large system of radial Schr\"odinger equations for scattering states. The system of differential equations is approximated as an ordinary linear nonhomogeneous system using the finite difference method. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at the origin and at an arbitrary large radius. The $K$-matrix for physical energies is calculated from the numerical solutions of the system by comparison to the analytical real solutions at large distances. Scattering poles and amplitudes are calculated from the physical $K$-matrix.</description>

      <title>Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Unlocking inaccessible performance of the quantum refrigerator with catalysts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. The previous study demonstrated that the incorporation of a catalyst can significantly enhance the performance of a heat engine by broadening its operational regime and achieving a more favorable trade-off between work output and efficiency. Building on this powerful framework and innovative idea, here we further extend the concept to a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. Furthermore, through a comparison with catalytic heat engines, our analysis reveals that two distinct permutation types are necessary to simultaneously enhance the COP and operational range of refrigerators, in contrast to heat engines for which a single permutation suffices. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.</description>

      <title>$k$-Positive Maps: New Characterizations and a Generation Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $k$-positive linear maps on matrix algebras and address two problems, (i) characterizations of $k$-positivity and (ii) generation of non-decomposable $k$-positive maps. On the characterization side, we derive optimization-based conditions equivalent to $k$-positivity that (a) reduce to a simple check when $k=d$, (b) reveal a direct link to the spectral norm of certain order-3 tensors (aligning with known NP-hardness barriers for $k&lt;d$), and (c) recast $k$-positivity as a novel optimization problem over separable states, thereby connecting it explicitly to separability testing. On the generation side, we introduce a Lie-semigroup-based method that, starting from a single $k$-positive map, produces one-parameter families that remain $k$-positive and non-decomposable for small enough times. We illustrate this by generating such families for $d=3$ and $d=4$. We also formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to test an equivalent form of the positive partial transpose (PPT) square conjecture (and do not find any violation of the latter). Our results provide practical computational tools for certifying $k$-positivity and a systematic way to sample $k$-positive non-decomposable maps.</description>

      <title>A simple method for seniority-zero quantum state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), the quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues of a given Hermitian matrix and preparing its eigenvectors, is considered the most promising approach to finding the ground states and their energies of electronic systems using a quantum computer. It requires, however, to be warm--started from an initial state with sufficiently high overlap with the ground state. For strongly-correlated states, where QPE is expected to have advantage over classical methods, preparation of such initial states requires deep quantum circuits and/or expensive hybrid quantum-classical optimization. It is well-known that orbital-optimized paired Coupled Cluster Doubles (oo-pCCD) method can describe the static correlation features of many strongly correlated singlet states. We show that pCCD and its unitary counterpart, UpCCD, become equivalent in the limit of small amplitudes if the amplitude matrix is sufficiently sparse. We demonstrate that substituting leading oo-pCCD amplitudes into the UpCCD Ansatz allows to prepare high-fidelity singlet states for models of multiple-bond dissociation in ethene, ethyne and dinitrogen, as well as for 1D Hubbard models at half-filling, with very shallow circuits. We envisage our method to be of general use for approximate preparation of singlet states for Quantum Phase Estimation and related algorithms.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Arguments of Quantum Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a publicly-verifiable non-interactive zero-knowledge argument system for QMA with the following properties.
  1. Transparent setup. Our protocol only requires a uniformly random string (URS) setup. The only prior publicly-verifiable NIZK for QMA (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) requires an entire obfuscated program as the common reference string.
  2. Extractability. Valid QMA witnesses can be extracted directly from our accepting proofs. That is, we obtain a publicly-verifiable non-interactive argument of quantum knowledge, previously only known in a privately-verifiable setting (Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang, CRYPTO 2020).
  Our construction introduces a novel ZX QMA verifier with "strong completeness" and builds upon the coset state authentication scheme from (Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024) within the context of QMA verification. Along the way, we establish new properties of the authentication scheme.
  The security of our construction rests on the heuristic use of a post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator. Rather than rely on the full-fledged classical oracle model (i.e. ideal obfuscation), we isolate a particular game-based property of the obfuscator that suffices for our proof, which we dub the evasive composability heuristic.
  As an additional contribution, we study a general method for replacing heuristic use of obfuscation with heuristic use of hash functions in the post-quantum setting. In particular, we establish security of the ideal obfuscation scheme of Jain, Lin, Luo, and Wichs (CRYPTO 2023) in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model (QPrO), which can be heuristically instantiated with a hash function. This gives us NIZK arguments of quantum knowledge for QMA in the QPrO, and additionally allows us to translate several quantum-cryptographic results that were only known in the classical oracle model to results in the QPrO.</description>

Abstract: The quantum logic program originated in a 1936 article by G. Birkhoff and J. von Neumann. This program is generally disregarded due to no-go theorems restricting the existence of the tensor product of elementary quantum logics and, above all, the impossibility of considering entangled states and Bell non-local states within the framework of these composite quantum logics. We revisit this study from the beginning and reverse the perspective. Here, the existence of a tensor product and a star involution are the only prerequisites for the definition of the state spaces. Surprisingly, the quantum logics constructed in this way turn out to have a close connection with irreducible Hilbert geometries, even though we did not impose this sort of structure ab initio. Endly, the existence of some basic quantum-like properties is explicitly proven in our framework : contextuality, no-broadcasting theorem, and Bell non-locality. These elements demonstrate that our quantum logic program is capable of achieving G. Birkhoff and J. von Neumann's initial ambition of founding quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation with Good qLDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme that is broadly applicable to quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. The scheme achieves constant qubit overhead and a time overhead of $O(d^{a+o(1)})$ for any $[[n,k,d]]$ qLDPC code with constant encoding rate and distance $d = \Omega(n^{1/a})$. For good qLDPC codes, the time overhead is minimized and reaches $O(d^{1+o(1)})$. In contrast, code surgery based on gauging measurement and brute-force branching requires a time overhead of $O(dw^{1+o(1)})$, where $d\leq w\leq n$. Thus, our scheme is asymptotically faster for all codes with $a &lt; 2$. This speedup is achieved by developing techniques that enable parallelized code surgery under constant qubit overhead and leverage classical locally testable codes for efficient resource state preparation. These results establish a new paradigm for accelerating fault-tolerant quantum computation on qLDPC codes, while maintaining low overhead and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>The Enigma of Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delayed-choice quantum eraser represents an interesting experiment that exemplifies Bohr's principle of complementarity in a beautiful way. According to the complementarity principle, in a two-path interference experiment, the knowledge of which path was taken by the particle and the appearance of interference are mutually exclusive. Even when the which-path information is merely retained in specific quantum path-markers, without being actually read, it suffices to eliminate interference. Nevertheless, if this path information is ``erased'' in some manner, the interference re-emerges, a phenomenon referred to as the quantum eraser. An intriguing aspect of this experiment is that if the path information is erased \emph{after} the particle has been detected on the screen, the interference still reappears, a phenomenon known as the delayed-choice quantum eraser. This observation has led to the interpretation that the particle can be influenced to exhibit characteristics of either a particle or a wave based on a decision made long after it has been registered on the screen. This idea has sparked considerable debate and discussions surrounding retrocausality. This controversy is reviewed here, and a detailed resolution provided.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifts heralding ground state squeezing and entanglement of two coupled harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often argued that two linearly coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in coupled oscillators signal non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement at zero temperature corresponding to two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects, frequency shifts and squeezing, represent the same underlying phenomenon but expressed in different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one description manifests itself as entanglement in the other. Frequency shifts therefore constitute an entanglement witness accessible via standard spectroscopy. While the underlying squeezing is not directly measurable, it can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring squeezed quantum noise. This uncovers a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh insight into how signatures of quantumness persists across the quantum-to-classical boundary.</description>

Abstract: Resolved-sideband cooling is a standard technique in cavity optomechanics enabling quantum control of mechanical motion, but its performance is ultimately limited by quantum backaction heating. This fundamental effect imposes a limit on the minimum achievable mechanical phonon number, establishing a finite-temperature floor regardless of the applied cooling strength. We generalize the semi-classical model for optomechanical cooling to describe universal cavity Hamiltonians incorporating both passive and active nonlinearities. As a concrete demonstration, we analyze the simplest circuit optomechanical system that implements a nonlinear drive via a Josephson junction. Our analysis reveals that this active nonlinear drive can eliminate the residual heating backaction, thereby comparing favorably with alternative optomechanical cooling schemes based on passive nonlinearities arXiv:2202.13228. By successfully overcoming the finite-temperature floor that limits conventional schemes, our method paves the way for unprecedented quantum control over mechanical systems and establishes the experimental viability of zero-heating optomechanical cooling.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Squeezing-Enhanced Photon-Number Measurements for GKP State Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an architecture for the generation of GKP states in which quadrature squeezing operations are used to control the average photon number statistics of probabilistic photon number measurements on Gaussian resource states. Specifically, we present an architecture employing a teleportation-based squeezing protocol and polynomial-gate applications integrated into a time-multiplexed multi-mode cluster state to generate cat states with high amplitudes, which are consequently used to generate GKP states with high quadrature effective squeezing. Compared to our previous work, in addition to using squeezing as a resource, the present architecture reduces damping and noise by minimizing the number of homodyne measurements required in GKP state generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements - including dynamic input-state resetting and an improved breeding algorithm - by achieving a fault-tolerance threshold of 11.5 dB cluster squeezing using the RHG surface code for error correction, without requiring active switching or photon-number resource states.</description>

      <title>Navigating Quantum Missteps in Agent-Based Modeling: A Schelling Model Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises transformative advances, but remains constrained by recurring misconceptions and methodological pitfalls. This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from "simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence" to "compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks. Instead, it should focus on clarifying when quantum advantage is structurally possible, developing best-in-class classical baselines through problem analysis, and fundamentally reformulating research questions rather than preserving classical iterative state change observation paradigms.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations for Reverse Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are quantum stochastic differential equations for reverse diffusion, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate stochastic reverse processes for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. The exact SDEs admit closed-form solutions that can be implemented online without the need for variational techniques. Importantly, the reverse SDEs and corresponding processes are generalizations of their forward counterparts. One can recover the forward process from its reverse, meaning that the reverse process experiences the same decoherence and noise effects as the forward process. This establishes an analytical framework for noise-resilient quantum gates, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.</description>

      <title>Approximation rates of quantum neural networks for periodic functions via Jackson's inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witnesses of Condensation for Enhanced Quantum Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</description>

      <title>Shake before use: universal enhancement of quantum thermometry by unitary driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry aims at determining temperature with ultimate precision in the quantum regime. Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Effects of Detuning and Auxiliary Qubits on Quantum Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how detuning and auxiliary qubits collaboratively enhance quantum synchronization in a dissipative multi-qubit system that is coupled to a structured reservoir. Our findings indicate that while detuning is ineffective in Markovian environments, it emerges as a powerful control parameter in the non-Markovian regime, where environmental memory facilitates long-lived phase coherence. It is shown that adding more auxiliary qubits amplifies this effect by strengthening the collective coupling and enhancing memory, resulting in robust phase locking within the system. Analysis using the Husimi Q-function, synchronization measures, and Arnold tongue structures reveals a detuning-induced enhancement of phase locking, which significantly improves stability compared to the resonance case. These results establish a cooperative control strategy where detuning actively engineers phases, while auxiliary qubits provide the necessary memory for sustained synchronization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model of binary random number generator (RNG) based on a Brillouin optomechanical system. The device uses a hard excitation mode in a Brillouin optomechanical system, where thermal noise induces spontaneous transitions between two stable states in the hard excitation mode. We demonstrate the existence of an amplitude criterion for observing these transitions and show that the probability distribution of their occurrence in the non-generating and generating states can be precisely controlled by the amplitude of an external pump wave. At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22. The obtained result opens a way for development of an all-optical integrated True RNG, generating a sequence of random bits with equal probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum measurement retrodiction using the principle of minimum change. For quantum-to-classical measurement channels, we show that all standard quantum divergences select the same retrodictive update, yielding a unique and divergence-independent quantum Bayesian inverse for any POVM and prior state. Using this update, we construct a symmetric joint distribution for pairs of POVMs and introduce the mutual retrodictability, for which we also derive a general upper bound that depends only on the prior state and holds for all measurements. This structure leads to two retrodictive entropic uncertainty relations, expressed directly in terms of the prior state and the POVMs, but valid independently of the retrodictive framework and fully compatible with the conventional operational interpretation of entropic uncertainty relations. Finally, we benchmark these relations numerically and find that they provide consistently tighter bounds than existing entropic uncertainty relations over broad classes of measurements and states.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic yet practical optimization of quantum circuits implementing GF($2^m$) multiplication and division operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optimized quantum circuits for GF$(2^m)$ multiplication and division operations, which are essential computing primitives in various quantum algorithms. Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\lceil{m/2}\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the CNOT gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \log \log(m)/\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$, including reductions in both CNOT and Toffoli gate counts. Additionally, we explore the complexity of implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries and demonstrate that a root, although itself still a linear reversible transformation, can require asymptotically deeper circuit implementations than the original unitary.</description>

Abstract: We present Cryptomite, a Python library of randomness extractor implementations. The library offers a range of two-source, seeded and deterministic randomness extractors, together with parameter calculation modules, making it easy to use and suitable for a variety of applications. We also present theoretical results, including new extractor constructions and improvements to existing extractor parameters. The extractor implementations are efficient in practice and tolerate input sizes of up to $2^{40}&gt;10^{12}$ bits. Contrary to alternatives using the fast Fourier transform, we implement convolutions efficiently using the number-theoretic transform to avoid rounding errors, making them well suited to cryptography. The algorithms and parameter calculation are described in detail, including illustrative code examples and performance benchmarking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In loop quantum gravity (LQG), states of the gravitational field are represented by labeled graphs called spin networks. Their dynamics can be described by a Hamiltonian constraint, { which acts on the spin network states modifying both spins and graphs.} Fixed-graph approximations of the dynamics have been extensively studied, but its full graph-changing action so far remains elusive. The latter, alongside the solutions of its constraint, are arguably the missing features { in canonical LQG to access phenomenology in all its richness}. Here, we discuss a recently developed numerical tool that, for the first time, implements graph-changing dynamics via the Hamiltonian constraint. We explain how it is used to find new solutions to that constraint and to show that some quantum geometric observables behave differently than in the graph-preserving truncation. We also point out that these new numerical methods can find applications in other domains.</description>

Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution, an important technique in tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms on classical computers, has recently been adapted to quantum computing. In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Rodriguez-Lopez, Wang, and Antezza [Phys. Rev. B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarization tensor. According to this article, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". By modifying the equality, which relates the conductivity and polarization expressions, the predictions of quantum field theory were revised and brought in agreement with those following from the nonrelativistic Kubo model. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) cooling is a well-established method for preparing trapped ion systems in their motional ground state. However, isolating a three-level system, as required for EIT cooling, is often challenging or impractical. Nonetheless, multilevel systems can inherently host dark states. In this work, we extend the EIT cooling framework to such multilevel systems. We develop a formalism to accurately determine the cooling rate in the weak sideband coupling regime and provide an approximate estimate for cooling rates beyond this regime, without the need for explicit simulation of the motional degree of freedom. We clarify the connection between the cooling rate and the absorption spectrum, offering a pathway for efficient near-ground-state cooling of ions with complex electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Multiply quantized vortex spectroscopy in a quantum fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However, here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We observe generic features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the study of generic amplification phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in high-dimensional graphs induced by correlated radial disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of models containing robust and analytically demonstrable multifractality induced by disorder correlations. Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on these chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance from the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Born-Oppenheimer Corrections in Condensed-Phase Ring Polymer Surface Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ring polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a mixed quantum-classical dynamics method for incorporating nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) into nonadiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our simulations of symmetric potentials, i.e., without energy bias, show that the RPSH-CA method, where nonadiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, is satisfactorily accurate and robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and nonadiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Overall, the effect of DBOC in RPSH-CA is in moderation compared to conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method where DBOC over-damps the dynamics significantly and reduces accuracy considerably, especially at low temperatures. However, the RPSH-CA and its DBOC variant struggle in simulations of asymmetric potentials specially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where nonadiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the high temperature adiabatic reaction regimes with symmetric potentials. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to nonadiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Optimized Unitary Coupled Cluster for Indirect Nuclear Spin-Spin Coupling Constants within a Quantum Linear Response Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum linear response (qLR) approach within an active-space framework for computing indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, a key ingredient in NMR spectra predictions. The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.</description>

      <title>Static Laboratory-Frame Polarization of a Trapped Molecular Ion for CP-Violation Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $\Omega/\Lambda$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.</description>

      <title>Fermionisation of the Aharonov--Bohm Phase on the Lightfront</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the phase space of the Maxwell field as a simplified framework to study the quantisation of holonomies (Wilson line operators) on lightlike (null) surfaces. Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state. The ground state depends on a choice of framing of the underlying paths.</description>

      <title>Is the large uncertainty of $\delta_{CP}$ fundamentally encoded in the neutrino quantum state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</description>
