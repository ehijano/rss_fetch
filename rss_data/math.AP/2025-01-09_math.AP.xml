      <title>Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that bi-frequency solitary waves are generically present in fermionic systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system and the Soler model. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available. We conjecture that stable bi-frequency modes serve as storages of the Dark Matter.</description>

      <title>A consistent non-linear Fokker-Planck model for a gas mixture of polyatomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi component gas mixture with translational and internal energy degrees of freedom without chemical reactions assuming that the number of particles of each species remains constant. We will illustrate the derived model in the case of two species, but the model can be generalized to multiple species. The two species are allowed to have different degrees of freedom in internal energy and are modeled by a system of kinetic Fokker-Planck equations featuring two interaction terms to account for momentum and energy transfer between the species. We prove consistency of our model: conservation properties, positivity of the temperatures, H-theorem and we characterize the equilibrium as two Maxwell distributions where all temperatures coincide.</description>

      <title>Interior regularity of doubly weighted quasi-linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the quasi-linear equation \[\mathrm{div}\, \mathcal A(x,u,\nabla u)=\mathcal B(x,u,\nabla u)\quad \text{in }\Omega,\qquad u\in H^{1,p}_{loc}(\Omega;w_1dx)\] where $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ are functions satisfying $\mathcal A(x,u,\nabla u)\sim w_1(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u+|u|^{p-2}u)$ and $\mathcal B(x,u,\nabla u)\sim w_2(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u+|u|^{p-2}u)$ for $p&gt;1$, a $p$-admissible weight function $w_1$, and another weight function $w_2$ compatible with $w_1$ in a suitable sense. We establish interior regularity results of weak solutions and use those results to obtain point-wise asymptotic estimates at infinity for solutions to \[-\mathrm{div}\,(w_1|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)=w_2|u|^{q-2}u\quad \text{in }\Omega,\qquad u\in D^{1,p,w_1}(\Omega)\] for a critical exponent $q&gt;p&gt;1$ in the sense of Sobolev.</description>

      <title>On a Generalized Prandtl-Batchelor Free Boundary Problem with a Singularity on a Stratified Lie Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of elliptic free boundary problems, including a generalized Prandtl Batchelor type problem with a singularity on a stratified Lie group. The associated energy functional is nondifferentiable, which precludes the direct application of standard variational techniques. Our analysis combines elliptic regularity theory with the mountain pass theorem in a non-Euclidean setting</description>

      <title>Knudsen boundary layer equations with incoming boundary condition: full range of cutoff collision kernels and Mach numbers of the far field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes tahe existence and uniqueness of the nonlinear Knudsen layer equation with incoming boundary conditions. It is well-known that the solvability conditions of the problem vary with the Mach number of the far Maxwellian $\mathcal{M}^\infty$. We consider full ranges of cutoff collision kernels (i.e., $- 3 &lt; \gamma \leq 1$) and all the Mach numbers of the far field in the $L^\infty_{x,v}$ framework. Additionally, the solution exhibits exponential decay $\exp \{- c x^\frac{2}{3 - \gamma} - c |v|^2 \}$ for some $c &gt; 0$. To address the general angular cutoff collision kernel, we introduce a $(x,v)$-mixed weight $\sigma$. The proof is essentially bsed on adding an artificial damping term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We research the Liouville type problem for the 3D stationary MHD equations in the frequency space. We establish two new Liouville type theorems for solutions with finite Dirichlet energy. Specifically, we show that the low-frequency part of the velocity field plays the leading role in a Liouville theory for MHD equations and then improve the results of Chae-Weng \cite{Chae-W}.</description>

      <title>Existence and blow up behavior of prescribed mass solutions on large smooth domains to the Kirchhoff equation with combined nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence, multiplicity and the asymptotic behavior of prescribed mass solutions to the following nonlinear Kirchhoff equation with mixed nonlinearities: \[
  \begin{cases}
  -(a+b\int|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x)\Delta u+V(x)u+\lambda u=|u|^{q-2}u+\beta|u|^{p-2}u \quad&amp;\text{in}\ \Omega,
  \int_{\Omega}|u|^2\mathrm{d}x=\alpha,
  \end{cases} \] both on large bounded smooth star-shaped domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and on $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{14}{3}&lt;q&lt;6$ and $V(x)$ is the potential. The standard approach based on the Pohozaev identity to obtain normalized solutions is invalid due to the presence of potential $V(x)$.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of nonlinear $(p,q)$-fractional Laplace operators under nonlocal Neumann conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate on a bounded open set of $\mathbb{R}^N$ with smooth boundary, an eigenvalue problem involving the sum of nonlocal operators $(-\Delta)_p^{s_1}+ (-\Delta)_q^{s_2}$ with $s_1,s_2\in (0,1)$, $p,q\in (1,\infty)$ and subject to the corresponding homogeneous nonlocal $(p,q)$-Neumann boundary condition. A careful analysis of the considered problem leads us to a complete description of the set of eigenvalues as being the precise interval $\{0\}\cup(\lambda_{1}(s_2,q),\infty)$, where $\lambda_{1}(s_2,q)$ is the first nonzero eigenvalue of the homogeneous fractional $q$-Laplacian under nonlocal $q$-Neumann boundary condition. Furthermore, we establish that every eigenfunctions is globally bounded.</description>

      <title>Stability of Weak Electrokinetic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Nernst-Planck-Stokes system on a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$ with general nonequilibrium Dirichlet boundary conditions for the ionic concentrations. It is well known that, in a wide range of cases, equilibrium steady state solutions of the system, characterized by zero fluid flow, are asymptotically stable. In these regimes, the existence of a natural dissipative structure is critical in obtaining stability. This structure, in general, breaks down under nonequilibrium conditions, in which case, in the steady state, the fluid flow may be nontrivial. In this short paper, we show that, nonetheless, certain classes of very weak nonequilibrium steady states, with nonzero fluid flow, remain globally asymptotically stable.</description>

      <title>Galaxy dynamics, gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system, Landau damping, and scattering theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system linearized around steady states that are extensively used in galaxy dynamics. Namely, polytropes and King steady states. We develop a complete stationary scattering theory for the selfadjoint, strictly positive, Antonov operator that governs the plane-symmetric linearized dynamics. We identify the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Antonov operator. Namely, we prove that the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Antonov operator coincides with its essential spectrum and with the spectrum of the unperturbed Antonov operator. Moreover, we prove that the part of the singular spectrum of the Antonov operator that is embedded in its absolutely continuous spectrum is contained in a closed set of measure zero, that we characterize. We construct the generalized Fourier maps and we prove that they are partially isometric with initial subspace the absolutely continuous subspace of the Antonov operator and that they are onto the Hilbert space where the Antonov operator is defined. Furthermore, we prove that the wave operators exist, are isometric, and are complete. Moreover, we obtain stationary formulae for the wave operators and we prove that Birman's invariance principle holds.Further, we prove that the gravitational Landau damping holds for the solutions to the linearized gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system with initial data in the absolutely continuous subspace of the Antonov operator. Namely, we prove that the gravitational force and its time derivative, as well as the gravitational potential and its time derivative, tend to zero as time tends to $\pm \infty.$ Furthermore, for these initial states the solutions to the linearized gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system are asymptotic, for large times, to the orbits of the gravitational potential of the steady state, in the sense that they are transported along these orbits.</description>

      <title>Well- and ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem for semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations on the torus $\mathbb T$. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition on the polynomial nonlinearity for the Cauchy problem to be well-posed in the Sobolev space $H^s(\mathbb T)$ for $s&gt;\frac 52$. For the well-posedness, we use the energy estimates and the gauge transformation. For the ill-posedness, we prove the non-existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a nonlinear free boundary problem modeling the radial growth of two-layer tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonlinear free boundary problem on the radial growth of a two-layer solid tumor with a quiescent core. The tumor surface and its inner interface separating the proliferating cells and the quiescent cells are both free boundaries. By deeply analyzing their relationship and employing the maximum principle, we show this problem is globally well-posed and prove the existence of a unique positive threshold $\sigma^*$ such that the problem admits a unique stationary solution with a quiescent core if and only if the externally supplied nutrient $\bar\sigma&gt; \sigma^*$. The stationary solution is globally asymptotically stable. The formation of the quiescent core and its interesting connection with the necrotic core are also given.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel Estimates for Schr\"odinger Operators with Decay at Infinity on Parabolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give estimates for positive solutions for the Schr\"odinger equation $(\Delta_\mu+W)u=0$ on a wide class of parabolic weighted manifolds $(M, d\mu)$ when $W$ decays to zero at infinity faster than quadratically. These can be combined with results of Grigor'yan to give matching upper and lower bounds for the heat kernel of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator $\Delta_\mu+W$. In particular, this appears to complement known results for Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbf{R}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions to special Lagrangian equations near infinity, with supercritical phases or with semiconvexity on solutions, are known to be asymptotic to quadratic polynomials for dimension $n\ge 3$, with an extra logarithmic term for $n=2$. Via modified Kelvin transforms, we characterize remainders in the asymptotic expansions by a single function near the origin. Such a function is smooth in even dimension, but only $C^{n-1,\alpha}$ in odd dimension $n$, for any $\alpha\in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Steady vortex patches on flat torus with a constant background vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a series of vortex patch solutions in a doubly-periodic rectangular domain (flat torus), which is accomplished by studying the contour dynamic equation for patch boundaries. We will illustrate our key idea by discussing the single-layered patches as the most fundamental configuration, and then investigate the general construction for $N$ patches near a point vortex equilibrium. Different with the case of bounded domains in $\mathbb R^2$, a constant background vorticity will arise from the compact nature of flat torus, and the $2$-dimensional translational invariance will bring troubles on determining patch locations. To overcome these two difficulties, we will add additional terms for background vorticity and introduce a centralized condition for location vector. By utilizing the regularity difference of terms in contour dynamic equations, we also obtain the $C^\infty$ regularity and convexity of boundary curves.</description>

      <title>Decay of large solutions around shocks to multi-D viscous conservation law with strictly convex flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a planar viscous weak shock for a scalar viscous conservation law with a strictly convex flux in multi-dimensional setting, where the transversal direction is periodic. We first show the contraction property for any solutions evolving from a large bounded initial perturbation in $L^2$ of the viscous shock. The contraction holds up to a dynamical shift, and it is measured by a weighted relative entropy. This result for the contraction extends the existing result in 1D \cite{Kang19} to the multi-dimensional case. As a consequence, if the bounded initial $L^2$-perturbation is also in $L^1$, then the large perturbation decays of rate $t^{-1/4}$ in $L^2$, up to a dynamical shift that is uniformly bounded in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates Dirichlet boundary condition related to a class of nonlinear parabolic problem with nonnegative $L^1$-data, which has a variable-order fractional $p$-Laplacian operator. The existence and uniqueness of renormalized solutions and entropy solutions to the equation is proved. To address the significant challenges encountered during this process, we use approximation and energy methods. In the process of proving, the well-posedness of weak solutions to the problem has been established initially, while also establishing a comparative result of solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the appearance of decay bounds in the velocity variable for solutions of the space-inhomogeneous Boltzmann equation without cutoff posed in a domain in the case of hard and moderately soft potentials. Such bounds are derived for general non-negative suitable weak subsolutions. These estimates hold true as long as mass, energy and entropy density functions are under control. The following boundary conditions are treated: in-flow, bounce-back, specular reflection, diffuse reflection and Maxwell reflection. The proof relies on a family of Truncated Convex Inequalities that is inspired by the one recently introduced by F. Golse, L. Silvestre and the first author (2023). To the best of our knowledge, the generation of arbitrary polynomial decay in the velocity variable for the Boltzmann equation without cutoff is new in the case of soft potentials, even for classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Stability of constant equilibria in a Keller--Segel system with gradient dependent chemotactic sensitivity and sublinear signal production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the homogeneous Neumann boundary-value problem for the Keller--Segel system \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t=\Delta u - \chi \nabla \cdot (u|\nabla v|^{p-2}\nabla v),\\[]
  v_t=\Delta v - v + u^{\theta}
  \end{cases} \end{align*} in $n$-dimensional bounded smooth domains for suitably regular nonnegative initial data, where $\chi &gt; 0$, $p \in (1, \infty)$ and $\theta \in (0,1]$. Under smallness conditions on $p$ and $\theta$, we prove that the spatially homogeneous equilibrium solution is stable. This generalizes the result in Kohatsu--Yokota (Le Matematiche, 2023; 78; 213--237) from the case $\theta = 1$ to more general values of $\theta$.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of generic Riemann solutions for Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-asymptotic stability of generic Riemann solution, consisting of a rarefaction wave, a contact discontinuity and a shock, for the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation, has been a long-standing open problem in kinetic theory. In this paper, we proved that the composite waves of generic Riemann profile including the inviscid self-similar rarefaction wave, the viscous contact wave (i.e., the viscous version of contact discontinuity) and the viscous shock profile with the time-dependent shift to both macroscopic and microscopic components are nonlinearly stable for the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation, by the first using the $a$-contraction method to the Boltzmann equation. Compared with the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, the new difficulties here lie in the microscopic effects of the Boltzmann shock profile and their interactions and/or couplings with the rarefaction wave, viscous contact wave and the macroscopic components from the macro-micro decomposition of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Refined Strichartz Estimates for sub-Laplacians in Heisenberg and $H$-type groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain refined Strichartz estimates for the sub-Riemannian Schr\"{o}dinger equation on $H$-type Carnot groups using Fourier restriction techniques. In particular, we extend the previously known Strichartz estimates previously obtained for the Heisenberg group also to non radial initial data. The same arguments permits to obtain refined Strichartz estimates for the wave equation on $H$-type groups. Our proof is based on estimates for the spectral projectors for sub-Laplacians and reinterprets Strichartz estimates as Fourier restriction theorems for nilpotent groups in the context of trace-class operator valued measures.</description>

      <title>Scalar behavior for a complex multi-soliton arising in blow-up for a semilinear wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with blow-up for the complex-valued semilinear wave equation with power nonlinearity in dimension 1. Up to a rotation of the solution in the complex plane, we show that near a characteristic blow-up point, the solution behaves exactly as in the real-valued case. Namely, up to a rotation in the complex plane, the solution decomposes into a sum of a finite number of decoupled solitons with alternate signs. The main novelty of our proof is a resolution of a complex-valued first order Toda system governing the evolution of the positions and the phases of the solitons.</description>

      <title>Maximal regularity for generalized boundary conditions in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider autonomous and non-autonomous evolution equations on a time interval $[0,\tau]$ in a Banach space $X$ with the non-standard time-boundary condition $u(0)=\Phi u(\tau)$, where $\Phi$ is a linear map on $X$. If $\Phi=0$, this is an initial value problem, whereas $\Phi=I$ corresponds to periodic boundary conditions, and $\Phi=-I$ to antiperiodic boundary conditions. Our main point is to establish maximal $L^p$-regularity. In the non-autonomous case we consider two situations. The first concerns time-dependent operators with a fixed domain. In the second one we take $X=H$ a Hilbert space and consider evolution equations associated with non-autonomous forms. Of special interest is then maximal regularity in $H$ with a non-standard time-boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Existence of traveling wave for a coupled incompressible Darcy's free boundary model with undercooling effect and surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a cell motility model that takes into account the cell membrane effect. The model introduced is an incompressible Darcy free boundary problem. This model involves a nonlinear term in the boundary condition to model the action of the membrane. This term can be seen as a undercooling effect of the membrane on the cell. It also implies a destabilizing nonlinear term in the boundary condition, depending on polarity markers and modeling the active character of the cytoskeleton. First, we study the linear stability of the steady state and prove that above a threshold, the disk is linearly unstable. This analysis highlights the stabilizing effect of undercooling. Then, using a bifurcation argument, we prove the existence of traveling waves that describe a persistent motion in cell migration and justify the relevance of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with a family of evolution problems arising in the physical modeling of small amplitude acoustic phenomena occurring in a fluid, bounded by a surface of extended reaction. They are all derived in a Lagrangian framework.
  We study well-posedness of these problems, their mutual relations, and their relations with other evolution problems modeling the same physical phenomena. They are those introduced in an Eulerian framework and those which deal with the (standard in Theoretical Acoustics) velocity potential. The latter reduce to the well--known wave equation with acoustic boundary conditions.
  Finally, we prove that all problems are asymptotically stable provided the system is linearly damped.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work is focused on exploring convergence of Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) when applied to a specific class of second-order fully nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It is well-known that as the number of data grows, PINNs generate a sequence of minimizers which correspond to a sequence of neural networks. We show that such sequence converges to a unique viscosity solution of a certain class of second-order fully nonlinear PDE's, provided the latter satisfies the comparison principle in the viscosity sense.</description>

      <title>Sharp Quantitative Stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality is a classical extension of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality, which in turn is a functional counterpart of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. The stability of these inequalities has received significant attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress in the geometric setting, a sharp quantitative stability result for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality has remained elusive, even in the special case of log-concave functions. In this work, we provide a unified and definitive stability framework for these foundational inequalities. By establishing the optimal quantitative stability for the Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality in full generality, we resolve the conjectured sharp stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality as a particular case. Our approach builds on the recent sharp stability results for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality obtained by the authors.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal to Local Convergence of Stefan Problems Under Optimal Convergence Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a free boundary problem with a nonlocal diffusion kernel function $k(x)$. Due to the long distance exchange effect of nonlocal diffusion, the free boundary can expand discontinuously, which makes the problem rather complicated. Among other things, we propose the optimal convergence condition without assuming the symmetry or compactness of $k$, i.e., the Fourier transform of $k$ satisfies $$\hat{k}(\xi)=1-|\xi|^2+o(|\xi|^2)\ \ \mbox{ as }\xi\rightarrow 0,$$ and discover an equivalent characterization of this optimal condition. More importantly, by the employment of the variational inequality, the apriori estimates and the Fourier transform, we demonstrate that, along a series of properly rescaled kernel functions, the corresponding solutions to the nonlocal free boundary problems converge to the solution of the classical Stefan problem under the proposed optimal condition.</description>

The originality is that we impose no condition on the boundary, which leads us to assume $L^2-$concentration. We also analyze the effect of a non-homogeneous nonlinearity that results in the fast convergence of the concentration point.</description>

      <title>Measures in the dual of $BV$: perimeter bounds and relations with divergence-measure fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06224v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze some properties of the measures in the dual of the space $BV$, by considering (signed) Radon measures satisfying a perimeter bound condition, which means that the absolute value of the measure of a set is controlled by the perimeter of the set itself, and whose total variations also belong to the dual of $BV$. We exploit and refine the results of [25](Phuc, Torres 2017), in particular exploring the relation with divergence-measure fields and proving the stability of the perimeter bound from sets to $BV$ functions under a suitable approximation of the given measure. As an important tool, we obtain a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation for $BV$ functions, which is of separate interest in itself and, in the context of Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields, implies a new way of approximating $\lambda$-pairings, as well as new bounds for their total variation. These results are also relevant due to their application in the study of weak solutions to the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data, which is explored in a subsequent work.</description>

Abstract: We study a local data inverse problem for the time-dependent Convection-Diffusion Equation (CDE) in a bounded domain where a part of the boundary is treated to be inaccessible. Up on assuming the inaccessible part to be flat, we seek for the unique determination of the time-dependent convection and the density terms from the knowledge of the boundary data measured outside the inaccessible part. In the process, we show that there is a natural gauge in the perturbations, and we prove that this is the only obstruction in the uniqueness result.</description>

Abstract: In this work, a rigorous proof of the nonexistence of breather solutions for NLS equations is presented. By using suitable virial functionals, we are able to characterize the nonexistence of breather solutions, different from standing waves, by only using their inner energy and the power of the corresponding nonlinearity of the equation. We extend this result for several NLS models with different power nonlinearities and even the derivative and logarithmic NLS equations.</description>

      <title>A relation between the Dirichlet and the Regularity problem for Parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the Dirichlet and Regularity problem for parabolic operators of the form $ L = \mbox{div}(A\nabla\cdot) - \partial_t $ on cylindrical domains $ \Omega = \mathcal O \times \mathbb R $, where the base $ \mathcal O \subset \mathbb R^{n} $ is a $1$-sided chord arc domain (and for one result Lipschitz) in the spatial variables.
  In the paper we answer the question when the solvability of the $L^p$ Regularity problem for $L$ (denoted by $ (R_L)_{p} $) can be deduced from the solvability of the $ L^{p'} $ Dirichlet problem for the adjoint operator $L^*$ (denoted $ (D_L^*)_{p'} $).
  We show that this holds if for at least of $q\in(1,\infty)$ the problem $ (R_L)_{q} $ is solvable. That is, we establish a duality/dichotomy result: Dirichlet solvability implies Regularity solvability in the dual $L^p$ range, or the Regularity problem is not solvable in any $L^p$.
  Results like these were only known in the elliptic settings (Kenig-Pipher (1993) and Shen (2006)) but are new for parabolic PDEs. Our result is one of the key components needed for the recent advancement of Dindo\v{s}, Li and Pipher in understanding solvability of the Regularity problem for operators whose coefficients satisfy certain natural Carleson condition (called also DKP-condition in the elliptic case).</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of free boundaries for the exterior Bernoulli problem for the half Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of the free boundary of the solution to the exterior Bernoulli problem for the half Laplacian when the Bernoulli's gradient parameter tends to $0^+$ and to $+\infty$. Moreover, we show that, under suitable conditions, the perpendicular rays of the free boundary always meet the convex envelope of the fixed boundary.</description>

      <title>Boundary estimates for non-divergence equations in $C^1$ domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain boundary nondegeneracy and regularity estimates for solutions to non-divergence equations in $C^1$ domains, providing an explicit modulus of continuity. Our results extend the classical Hopf-Oleinik lemma and boundary Lipschitz regularity for domains with $C^{1,\mathrm{Dini}}$ boundaries, while also recovering the known $C^{1-\varepsilon}$ regularity for flat Lipschitz domains, unifying both theories with a single proof.</description>

      <title>On the integrability properties of Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $r,s \in [2,\infty]$ and consider the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$. We study the following two questions for suitable $s$-homogeneous Banach spaces $X \subset \mathcal{S}'$: does every $u_0 \in L^2_\sigma$ have a weak solution that belongs to $L^r(0,\infty;X)$, and are the $L^r(0,\infty;X)$ norms of the solutions bounded uniformly in viscosity? We show that if $\frac{2}{r} + \frac{3}{s} &lt; \frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2r}$, then for a Baire generic datum $u_0 \in L^2_\sigma$, no weak solution $u^\nu$ belongs to $L^r(0,\infty;X)$. If $\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2r} \leq \frac{2}{r} + \frac{3}{s} &lt; \frac{3}{2}$ instead, global solvability in $L^r(0,\infty;X)$ is equivalent to the a priori estimate $\|u^\nu\|_{L^r(0,\infty;X)} \leq C \nu^{3-5/r-6/s} \|u_0\|_{L^2}^{4/r+6/s-2}$. Furthermore, we can only have $\limsup_{\nu \to 0} \|u^\nu\|_{L^r(0,\infty;Z)} &lt; \infty$ for all $u_0 \in L^2_\sigma$ if $\frac{2}{r} + \frac{3}{s}= \frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2r}$.
  The above results and their variants rule out, for a Baire generic $L^2_\sigma$ datum, $L^4(0,T;L^4)$ integrability and various other known sufficient conditions for the energy equality. As another application, for suitable 2-homogeneous Banach spaces $Z \hookrightarrow L^2_\sigma$, each $u_0 \in Z$ has a Leray-Hopf solution $u \in L^3(0,\infty;\dot{B}_{3,\infty}^{1/3})$ if and only if a uniform-in-viscosity bound $\|u\|_{L^3(0,\infty;\dot{B}_{3,\infty}^{1/3})} \leq C \|u_0\|_Z^{2/3}$ holds.
  As a by-product we show that if global regularity holds for the Navier-Stokes equations, then for a Baire generic $L^2_\sigma$ datum, the Leray-Hopf solution is unique and satisfies the energy equality. We also show that if global regularity holds in the Euler equations, then anomalous energy dissipation must fail for a Baire generic $L^2_\sigma$ datum. These two results also hold on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Born and Inverse Born series for a special case of the second harmonic generation system of PDEs. We give a recursive formula for the forward operators and prove boundedness conditions that guarantee the convergence of the Born and inverse Born series. We also use fixed point theory to give explicit conditions for convergence of the Born series.</description>

      <title>Kasner bounces and fluctuating collapse inside hairy black holes with charged matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interior of black holes in the presence of charged scalar hair of small amplitude $\epsilon$ on the event horizon and show their terminal boundary is a crushing Kasner-like singularity. These spacetimes are spatially homogeneous and they differ significantly from the hairy black holes with uncharged matter previously studied in [M. Van de Moortel, Violent nonlinear collapse inside charged hairy black holes, Arch. Rational. Mech. Anal., 248, 89, 2024] in that the electric field is dynamical and subject to the backreaction of charged matter. This charged backreaction causes drastically different dynamics compared to the uncharged case that impact the formation of the spacelike singularity, exhibiting novel phenomena such as
  - Collapsed oscillations: oscillatory growth of the scalar hair, nonlinearly induced by the collapse.
  - A fluctuating collapse: The final Kasner exponents' dependency in $\epsilon$ is via an expression of the form $|\sin\left(\omega_0 \cdot \epsilon^{-2}+ O(\log (\epsilon^{-1}))\right)|$.
  - A Kasner bounce: a transition from an unstable Kasner metric to a different stable Kasner metric.
  The Kasner bounce occurring in our spacetime is reminiscent of the celebrated BKL scenario in cosmology. We additionally propose a construction indicating the relevance of the above phenomena -- including Kasner bounces -- to spacelike singularities inside more general (asymptotically flat) black holes, beyond the hairy case. While our result applies to all values of $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, in the $\Lambda&lt;0$ case, our spacetime corresponds to the interior region of a charged asymptotically Anti-de-Sitter stationary black hole, also known as a holographic superconductor, and whose exterior region was rigorously constructed in the recent mathematical work [W. Zheng, Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Spherically Symmetric Hairy Black Holes, arXiv.2410.04758].</description>

      <title>Almost holomorphic curves in real analytic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the theory of exterior differential systems, we study the existence of germ of pseudo-holomorphic disk in a real analytic hypersurface locally defined in a complex manifold equipped with J a real analytic almost complex structure. The integrable case in C n with J the multiplication by i has been intensively studied by several authors [DF], [DA1] and [DA2] for example. The non integrable case is drastically different essentially due to the following fact : in generic case, there is no J-invariant objects of dimension bigger than one. This simple observation leads to the non existence of some equivalents of Segree varieties or ideals of holomorphic functions which play a fundamental role in the complex case. Nevertheless in the almost complex case, we adopt the exterior differential system point of view of E.Cartan developed and clarified in [BCGGG].</description>

      <title>Latent Neural PDE Solver: a reduced-order modelling framework for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown promising potential in accelerating the numerical simulation of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Different from many existing neural network surrogates operating on high-dimensional discretized fields, we propose to learn the dynamics of the system in the latent space with much coarser discretizations. In our proposed framework - Latent Neural PDE Solver (LNS), a non-linear autoencoder is first trained to project the full-order representation of the system onto the mesh-reduced space, then a temporal model is trained to predict the future state in this mesh-reduced space. This reduction process simplifies the training of the temporal model by greatly reducing the computational cost accompanying a fine discretization. We study the capability of the proposed framework and several other popular neural PDE solvers on various types of systems including single-phase and multi-phase flows along with varying system parameters. We showcase that it has competitive accuracy and efficiency compared to the neural PDE solver that operates on full-order space.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions and reductions of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, Schr\"odinger equations with cubic and more complex nonlinearities containing the unknown function with constant delay are analyzed. The physical considerations that can lead to the appearance of a delay in such nonlinear equations and mathematical models are expressed. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the studied partial differential equations with delay to simpler ordinary differential equations and ordinary differential equations with delay. New exact solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation of the general form with delay, which are expressed in quadratures, are found. To construct exact solutions, a combination of methods of generalized separation of variables and the method of functional constraints are used. Special attention is paid to three equations with cubic nonlinearity, which allow simple solutions in elementary functions, as well as more complex exact solutions with generalized separation of variables. Solutions representing a nonlinear superposition of two traveling waves, the amplitude of which varies periodically in time and space, are constructed. Some more complex nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of a general form with variable delay are also studied. The results of this work can be useful for the development and improvement of mathematical models described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay and related functional PDEs, and the obtained exact solutions can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics with delay.</description>

      <title>Criticality, splitting theorems under spectral Ricci bounds and the topology of stable minimal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove general criticality criteria for operators $\Delta + V$ on manifolds $M$ with two ends, where $V$ bounds the Ricci curvature of $M$, and a related spectral splitting theorem. We apply them to get new rigidity results for stable and $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with non-negative bi-Ricci or sectional curvature, in ambient dimension up to $5$ and $6$, respectively. In the special case where the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^4$, we prove that a $1/3$-stable minimal hypersurface must either have one end or be a catenoid. As a consequence, any proper, $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurface with $\delta &gt; 1/3$ and finite fundamental group must be a hyperplane.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin Calculus Approach to Backward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the solutions to multi-dimensional backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs), whose (possibly random) generator reflects nonlinear dependence on both the solution process and the martingale integrand component of the adapted solutions, as well as their diagonal processes. The well-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which renders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes while contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semi-linear partial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of BSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize dynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment opportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands being identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.</description>
