      <title>Third-Quantized Master Equations as a classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process and its Entropy Production Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third quantization is used in open quantum systems to construct a superoperator basis in which quadratic Lindbladians can be turned into a normal form. From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third quantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain the dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce a new basis for third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the $Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator coherent state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which facilitates a clear definition of the entropy production and heat dissipation rate in quantum systems. As an example, we investigate the entropy production rate of a harmonic oscillator in a squeezed thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Automated Synthesis of Fault-Tolerant State Preparation Circuits for Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms is the initialization of a logical state for a given quantum error-correcting code from a set of noisy qubits. A scheme that has demonstrated promising results for small code instances that are realizable on currently available hardware composes a non-fault-tolerant state preparation step with a verification step that checks for spreading errors. Known circuit constructions of this scheme are mostly obtained manually, and no algorithmic techniques for constructing depth- or gate-optimal circuits exist. As a consequence, the current state of the art exploits this scheme only for specific code instances and mostly for the special case of distance 3 codes. In this work, we propose an automated approach for synthesizing fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for arbitrary CSS codes. We utilize methods based on satisfiability solving (SAT) techniques to construct fault-tolerant state preparation circuits consisting of depth- and gate-optimal preparation and verification circuits. We also provide heuristics that can synthesize fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for code instances where no optimal solution can be obtained in an adequate timeframe. Moreover, we give a general construction for non-deterministic state preparation circuits beyond distance 3. Numerical evaluations using $d=3$ and $d=5$ codes confirm that the generated circuits exhibit the desired scaling of the logical error rates. The resulting methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc. Such methods are an important step in providing fault-tolerant circuit constructions that can aid in near-term demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford diagonalization for measurement shot reduction in quantum expectation value estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating expectation values on near-term quantum computers often requires a prohibitively large number of measurements. One widely-used strategy to mitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets of mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this constraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to be grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we decompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size, ignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local non-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in most cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to both fermionic and bosonic Hamiltonians. For electronic structure, vibrational structure, Fermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, we show that $k$-NoCliD reduces the number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin.</description>

      <title>Quantum highway: Observation of minimal and maximal speed limits for few and many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the time evolution of a quantum state allows one to verify the thermalization rate or the propagation speed of correlations in generic quantum systems. Inspired by the energy-time uncertainty principle, bounds have been demonstrated on the maximal speed at which a quantum state can change, resulting in immediate and practical tasks. Based on a programmable superconducting quantum processor, we test the dynamics of various emulated quantum mechanical systems encompassing single- and many-body states. We show that one can test the known quantum speed limits and that modifying a single Hamiltonian parameter allows the observation of the crossover of the different bounds on the dynamics. We also unveil the observation of minimal quantum speed limits in addition to more common maximal ones, i.e., the lowest rate of change of a unitarily evolved quantum state. Our results establish a comprehensive experimental characterization of quantum speed limits and pave the way for their subsequent study in engineered non-unitary conditions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theory of Quantum Neural Network Loss Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical neural networks with random initialization famously behave as Gaussian processes in the limit of many neurons, with the architecture of the network determining the covariance of the associated process. This limit allows one to completely characterize the training behavior of such networks and show that, generally, classical neural networks train efficiently via gradient descent. No such general understanding exists for quantum neural networks (QNNs), which -- outside of certain special cases -- are known to not behave as Gaussian processes when randomly initialized.
  We here prove that instead QNNs and their first two derivatives generally form what we call Wishart processes, where now certain algebraic properties of the network determine the hyperparameters of the process. This Wishart process description allows us to, for the first time:
  1. Give necessary and sufficient conditions for a QNN architecture to have a Gaussian process limit.
  2. Calculate the full gradient distribution, unifying previously known barren plateau results.
  3. Calculate the local minima distribution of algebraically constrained QNNs.
  The transition from trainability to untrainability in each of these contexts is governed by a single parameter we call the "degrees of freedom" of the network architecture. We thus end by proposing a formal definition for the "trainability" of a given QNN architecture using this experimentally accessible quantity.</description>

      <title>One-to-one Correspondence between Deterministic Port-Based Teleportation and Unitary Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Port-based teleportation is a variant of quantum teleportation, where the receiver can choose one of the ports in his part of the entangled state shared with the sender, but cannot apply other recovery operations. We show that the optimal fidelity of deterministic port-based teleportation (dPBT) using $N=n+1$ ports to teleport a $d$-dimensional state is equivalent to the optimal fidelity of $d$-dimensional unitary estimation using $n$ calls of the input unitary operation. From any given dPBT, we can explicitly construct the corresponding unitary estimation protocol achieving the same optimal fidelity, and vice versa. Using the obtained one-to-one correspondence between dPBT and unitary estimation, we derive the asymptotic optimal fidelity of port-based teleportation given by $F = 1-\Theta(d^4 N^{-2})$, which improves the previously known result given by $1-O(d^5 N^{-2}) \leq F \leq 1-\Omega(d^2 N^{-2})$. We also show that the optimal fidelity of unitary estimation for the case $n\leq d-1$ is $F = {n+1 \over d^2}$, and this fidelity is equal to the optimal fidelity of unitary inversion with $n\leq d-1$ calls of the input unitary operation even if we allow indefinite causal order among the calls.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Force and Inverted Harmonic Potential for Rapid Creation of Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating macroscopic spatial superposition states is crucial for investigating matter-wave interferometry and advancing quantum sensor technology. Currently, two potential methods exist to achieve this objective. The first involves using inverted harmonic potential (IHP) to spatially delocalize quantum states through coherent inflation [1]. The second method employs a spin-dependent force to separate two massive wave packets spatially [2]. The disadvantage of the former method is the slow initial coherent inflation, while the latter is hindered by the diamagnetism of spin-embedded nanocrystals, which suppresses spatial separation. In this study, we integrate two methods: first, we use the spin-dependent force to generate initial spatial separation, and second, we use IHP to achieve coherent inflating trajectories of the wavepackets. This approach enables the attainment of massive large spatial superposition in minimal time. For instance, a spatial superposition with a mass of $10^{-15}$ kg and a size of 50 $\mu$m is realized in $0.1$ seconds. We also calculate the evolution of wave packets in both harmonic potential (HP) and IHP using path integral approach.</description>

      <title>Exponential Expansion of Massive Schr\"{o}dinger Cats for Sensing and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger cat states of levitated masses have several applications in sensing and, offer an avenue to explore the fundamental nature -- classical vs nonclassical -- of gravity, eg, through gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). The interaction between a qubit and a levitated mass is a convenient method to create such a cat state. The size of the superpositions is limited by weak mass-qubit interactions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a protocol that exponentially expands an initially small superposition via Gaussian dynamics and successfully recombines it to complete an interferometry. An unknown force can be sensed by the superposition exponentially fast in the expansion time. The entanglement between two such interferometers interacting via a quantum force is -- for the first time in qubit-based non-Gaussian protocols -- obtained by solving the full quantum dynamics using Gaussian techniques. GIE grows exponentially, thereby making it closer to experimental feasibility. Requirements of experimental precision and decoherence are obtained.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Simulators for Quantum Network Modelling: A Comprehensive Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum network research, is exploring new networking protocols, physics-based hardware and novel experiments to demonstrate how quantum distribution will work over large distances. Current work explores much of these concepts in simulations, that are developed to understand how quantum networking will be set up and researchers can experiment virtually. Exposing flaws in network designs, like unsustainable topologies, or develop protocols that efficiently utilize network resources, simulators can also help assess whether workloads are balanced across virtual machines in the network. However, much of these simulation models come without reliable verification methods, for testing performance in real deployments.
  In this paper, we present a review of, to the best of our knowledge, currently used toolkits for modeling quantum networks. With these toolkits and standardized validation techniques, we can lay down the foundations for more accurate and reliable quantum network simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two descriptions are introduced and analyzed for a reflectivity estimation and detection scheme that does not involve measurement of photons scattered by the target. One description, provided by the Hamiltonian dynamics of the full transmitter/receiver optical system, incurs an exponential cost in transmitter intensity for a given estimation sensitivity but is linearly improved with the intensity of the thermal background. The other description, based on optical quantum circuits, exhibits sensitivity around a factor of 1/2 of the optimal entanglement-assisted scheme, but incurs an inverse linear reduction in sensitivity with increasing thermal background. The results have applications for the design of optically active receivers based on combining echo-seeded spontaneous parametric downconversion and induced coherence due to photon indistinguishability.</description>

      <title>Cooperative atomic emission from a line of atoms interacting with a resonant plane surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative effects such as super- and subradiance can be observed in the fluorescence emitted by a system of N atoms in vacuum, after interaction with a laser beam. In the vicinity of a dielectric or metallic surface, Casimir-Polder effects can modify collective atomic frequency shifts and decay rates. In this work, we study cooperative fluorescent emission next to resonant surfaces using the coupled dipoles model. We show that cooperative effects, expected in free space, are absent when the atoms are close to a surface whose polariton resonances coincide with the dominant atomic dipole coupling. In this case, cooperative effects are overshadowed by the very fast decay of the atomic fluorescence into surface modes. We illustrate our formalism and our results by considering a line of cesium 6D3/2 atoms in front of a sapphire surface. Finally, we propose the study of Cesium 6P3/2 atoms in front of a resonant metasurface as the most promising scenario for experimentally demonstrating the results of our study.</description>

      <title>A Practical Introduction to Benchmarking and Characterization of Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in quantum technology has transformed quantum computing and quantum information science from theoretical possibilities into tangible engineering challenges. Breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum simulations, and quantum error correction are bringing useful quantum computation closer to fruition. These remarkable achievements have been facilitated by advances in quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV). QCVV methods and protocols enable scientists and engineers to scrutinize, understand, and enhance the performance of quantum information-processing devices. In this Tutorial, we review the fundamental principles underpinning QCVV, and introduce a diverse array of QCVV tools used by quantum researchers. We define and explain QCVV's core models and concepts -- quantum states, measurements, and processes -- and illustrate how these building blocks are leveraged to examine a target system or operation. We survey and introduce protocols ranging from simple qubit characterization to advanced benchmarking methods. Along the way, we provide illustrated examples and detailed descriptions of the protocols, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss their potential scalability to future large-scale quantum computers. This Tutorial serves as a guidebook for researchers unfamiliar with the benchmarking and characterization of quantum computers, and also as a detailed reference for experienced practitioners.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-Induced-Transparency Cooling of High-Nuclear-Spin Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling of $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ ions with a nuclear spin of $I=3/2$, which are a good candidate of qubits for future large-scale trapped ion quantum computing. EIT cooling of atoms or ions with a complex ground-state level structure is challenging due to the lack of an isolated $\Lambda$ system, as the population can escape from the $\Lambda$ system to reduce the cooling efficiency. We overcome this issue by leveraging an EIT pumping laser to repopulate the cooling subspace, ensuring continuous and effective EIT cooling. We cool the two radial modes of a single $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ ion to average motional occupations of 0.08(5) and 0.15(7) respectively. Using the same laser parameters, we also cool all the ten radial modes of a five-ion chain to near their ground states. Our approach can be adapted to atomic species possessing similar level structures. It allows engineering of the EIT Fano-like spectrum, which can be useful for simultaneous cooling of modes across a wide frequency range, aiding in large-scale trapped-ion quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic Hamiltonians for multimode bosonic systems results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those seen in chaotic systems. Specifically, considering initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in entanglement dynamics and the negative value of tripartite mutual information. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, we find that the spectral form factor exhibits a non-linear ramp and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display a power law growth. These results show that information scrambling, associated with randomness, is a distinct feature from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states of continuous-variable systems that are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the arising of non-hermitian phase transitions on quantum torus surfaces. We consider a single fermion whose dynamics is governed by the Dirac equation confined to move on a quantum torus surface. The effects of the geometry are take into account by using the tetrad formalism and the spin connection. The Dirac equation gives rise to two coupled first-order differential equations for each spinor component. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for each spinor component are computed numerically and the non-hermitian phase transitions are investigated in terms of the geometric features of the torus and the magnitude of the imaginary component of the mass.</description>

      <title>Improved accuracy for decoding surface codes with matching synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method, called matching synthesis, for decoding quantum codes that produces an enhanced assignment of errors from an ensemble of decoders. We apply matching synthesis to develop a decoder named Libra, and show in simulations that Libra increases the error-suppression ratio $\Lambda$ by about $10\%$. Matching synthesis takes the solutions of an ensemble of approximate solvers for the minimum-weight hypergraph matching problem, and produces a new solution that combines the best local solutions, where locality depends on the hypergraph. We apply matching synthesis to an example problem of decoding surface codes with error correlations in the conventional circuit model, which induces a hypergraph with hyperedges that are local in space and time. We call the matching-synthesis decoder Libra, and in this example the ensemble consists of correlated minimum-weight matching using a different hypergraph with randomly perturbed error probabilities for each ensemble member. Furthermore, we extend matching synthesis to perform summation of probability for multiple low-weight solutions and at small computational overhead, approximating the probability of an equivalence class; in our surface code problem, this shows a modest additional benefit. We show that matching synthesis has favorable scaling properties where accuracy begins to saturate with an ensemble size of 60, and we remark on pathways to real-time decoding at near-optimal decoding accuracy if one has an accurate model for the distribution of errors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement structures in disordered chains of nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study [Phys. Rev. B 17 174111 (2022)] has hypothesized the assembly, along a specific type of one-dimensional defects of diamond, of chains of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, potentially enabling the creation of qubit registers via their dipole-coupled electron spins. Here we investigate the connectivity of chains of up to ten coupled spins, mediated by the bi- and multipartite entanglement of their eigenstates. Rather conveniently, for regularly spaced spins the vast majority of the eigenstates displays strong connectivity, especially towards the center of the spectrum and for longer chains. Furthermore, positional disorder can change, and possibly reduce, the connectivity of the register, but seldom suppresses it.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning for Linear Properties of Bounded-Gate Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast and complicated large-qubit state space forbids us to comprehensively capture the dynamics of modern quantum computers via classical simulations or quantum tomography. However, recent progress in quantum learning theory invokes a crucial question: given a quantum circuit containing d tunable RZ gates and G-d Clifford gates, can a learner perform purely classical inference to efficiently predict its linear properties using new classical inputs, after learning from data obtained by incoherently measuring states generated by the same circuit but with different classical inputs? In this work, we prove that the sample complexity scaling linearly in d is necessary and sufficient to achieve a small prediction error, while the corresponding computational complexity may scale exponentially in d. Building upon these derived complexity bounds, we further harness the concept of classical shadow and truncated trigonometric expansion to devise a kernel-based learning model capable of trading off prediction error and computational complexity, transitioning from exponential to polynomial scaling in many practical settings. Our results advance two crucial realms in quantum computation: the exploration of quantum algorithms with practical utilities and learning-based quantum system certification. We conduct numerical simulations to validate our proposals across diverse scenarios, encompassing quantum information processing protocols, Hamiltonian simulation, and variational quantum algorithms up to 60 qubits.</description>

      <title>Ultra-broadband non-degenerate guided-wave bi-photon source in the near and mid-infrared</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest applications in ultrafast quantum metrology require bright, broadband bi-photon sources with one of the photons in the mid-infrared and the other in the visible to near infrared. However, existing sources based on bulk crystals are limited in brightness due to the short interaction length and only allow for limited dispersion engineering. Here, we present an integrated PDC source based on a Ti:LiNbO$_3$ waveguide that generates broadband bi-photons with central wavelengths at $860\,\mathrm{nm}$ and $2800\,\mathrm{nm}$. Their spectral bandwidth exceeds $25\,\mathrm{THz}$ and is achieved by simultaneous matching of the group velocities and cancellation of group velocity dispersion for the signal and idler field. We provide an intuitive understanding of the process by studying our source's behaviour at different temperatures and pump wavelengths, which agrees well with simulations.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Hierarchical Equations Of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an extended version of the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) to compute output physical properties of a bosonic environment, which is allowed to be initially prepared at an earlier time in a non-Gaussian input state and then non-perturbatively interact with a quantum system. While spectral assumptions analogous to the ones used in the regular HEOM are imposed to compute output bath observables, they are not required to model input states, leading to time-dependent contributions to the equations. For a given desired input state and output observable, the range of the indexes extending the regular HEOM is, by construction, bounded. Overall, the aim of this formalism is to take advantage of the efficiency of the HEOM framework to model non-Gaussian input states and the dynamics of environmental observables in bosonic, non-Markovian open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative phase transition and metrology in collectively pumped superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a many-atom system exhibiting two competing collective processes: collective decay and collective pumping of excitations, relevant e.g. in cavity QED platforms. We find that the steady state exhibits a sharp transition as a function of the pumping strength, between fully depopulated and fully populated states. We devise a metrological protocol for measuring system parameters by scanning the pumping around the critical point, finding that the sensitivity scales as 1/N , thus beating the standard quantum limit thanks to the buildup of correlations. Crucially, our theoretical analysis, verified numerically, goes beyond the adiabatic regime of an infinite scan time: we study non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics around the transition and their effect on the sensitivity, revealing that the favorable 1/N scaling survives well beyond adiabaticity. Apart from its direct impact on metrology with superradiant atomic systems, our general analysis provides new perspectives for studying the metrological utility of dissipative phase transitions in realistic finite-time protocols.</description>

      <title>Classifying Entanglement by Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics that separate the quantum realm from the classical one. Characterization of entanglement as a physical resource for quantum technology became of uppermost importance. While the entanglement of bipartite systems is already well understood, the ultimate goal to cope with the properties of entanglement of multipartite systems is still far from being realized. This dissertation covers characterization of multipartite entanglement using algebraic-geometric tools. Firstly, we establish an algorithm to classify multipartite entanglement by $k$-secant varieties of the Segre variety and $\ell$-multilinear ranks that are invariant under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). We present a fine-structure classification of multiqubit and tripartite entanglement based on this algorithm. Another fundamental problem in quantum information theory is entanglement transformation that is quite challenging regarding to multipartite systems. It is captivating that the proposed entanglement classification by algebraic geometry can be considered as a reference to study SLOCC and asymptotic SLOCC interconversions among different resources based on tensor rank and border rank, respectively. In this regard, we also introduce a new class of tensors that we call \emph{persistent tensors} and construct a lower bound for their tensor rank. We further cover SLOCC convertibility of multipartite systems considering several families of persistent tensors.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of deep neural networks for optimal control has gathered a considerable amount of interest in recent years. Here, we utilize deep reinforcement learning to control individual evolutions of coupled harmonic oscillators in an oscillator network. Our work showcases a numerical approach to actively cool internal oscillators to their thermal ground states through modulated forces imparted to the external oscillators in the network. We present our results for thermal cooling of all oscillators in multiple network configurations and introduce the utility of our scheme in the quantum regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tests of quantum steering in which the trusted party does not have perfect control of their measurements. We report on steering inequalities that remain unaffacted when introducing up to a threshold magnitude of measurement imprecision. This phenomenon, which we call an imprecision plateau, thus permits a departure from the standard assumption of idealised measurements without any incuring cost to the detection power of steering experiments. We provide an explanation for why imprecision plateaus are possible, a simple criterion for their existence and tools for analysing their properties. We also demonstrate that these plateaus have natural applications when the assumption of perfect measurements is relaxed: they allow for maintaining both the noise- and loss-robustness of standard steering tests and the performance rate of idealised one-sided device-independent random number generators.</description>

      <title>Pulse characterization at the single-photon level through chronocyclic $Q$-function measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of the complex spectral amplitude that is, the spectrum and spectral phase, of single-photon-level light fields is a crucial capability for modern photonic quantum technologies. Since established pulse characterisation techniques are not applicable at low intensities, alternative approaches are required. Here, we demonstrate the retrieval of the complex spectral amplitude of single-photon-level light pulses through measuring their chronocyclic $Q-$function. Our approach draws inspiration from quantum state tomography by exploiting the analogy between quadrature phase space and time-frequency phase space. In the experiment, we perform time-frequency projections with a quantum pulse gate, which directly yield the chronocyclic $Q-$function. We evaluate the data with maximum likelihood estimation, which is the established technique for quantum state tomography. This yields not only an unambigious estimate of the complex spectral amplitude of the state under test that does not require any \textit{a priori} information, but also allows for, in principle, estimating the spectral-temporal coherence properties of the state. Our method accurately recovers features such as jumps in the spectral phase and is resistant against regions with zero spectral intensity, which makes it immediately beneficial also for classical pulse characterization problems.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Petz-R\'enyi Divergences and their Applications for Device-Independent Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational techniques have been recently developed to find tighter bounds on the von Neumann entropy in a completely device-independent (DI) setting. This, in turn, has led to significantly improved key rates of DI protocols, in both the asymptotic limit as well as in the finite-size regime. In this paper, we discuss two approaches towards applying these variational methods for Petz-R\'enyi divergences instead. We then show how this can be used to further improve the finite-size key rate of DI protocols, utilizing a fully-R\'enyi entropy accumulation theorem developed in a partner work. Petz-R\'enyi divergences can also be applied to study DI advantage distillation, in which two-way communication is used to improve the noise tolerance of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. We implement these techniques to derive increased noise tolerances for DIQKD protocols, which surpass all previous known bounds.</description>

Abstract: Photon Number Resolving Detectors (PNRDs) are devices capable of measuring the number of photons present in an incident optical beam, enabling light sources to be measured and characterized at the quantum level. In this paper, we explore the performance and design considerations of a linearly multiplexed photon number-resolving single-photon detector array, integrated on a single mode waveguide. Our investigation focus on defining and analyzing the fidelity of such an array under various conditions and proposing practical designs for its implementation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show how propagation losses and dark counts may have a strong impact on the performance of the system and highlight the importance of mitigating these effects in practical implementations.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum physics, both conceptually and for its many applications. Classifying an arbitrary multipartite state as entangled or separable -- a task referred to as the separability problem -- poses a significant challenge, since a state can be entangled with respect to many different of its partitions. We develop a certification pipeline that feeds the statistics of random local measurements into a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, to determine with respect to which partitions a given quantum state is entangled. After training a model on randomly generated quantum states, entangled in different partitions and of varying purity, we verify the accuracy of its predictions on simulated test data, and finally apply it to states prepared on IBM quantum computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Basis-independent quantum coherence and its distribution under relativistic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly focused on the effect of relativistic motion on quantum coherence. Prior research predominantly examined the influence of relative motion on basis-dependent quantum coherence, underscoring its susceptibility to decoherence under accelerated conditions. Yet, the effect of relativistic motion on basis-independent quantum coherence, which is critical for understanding the intrinsic quantum features of a system, remains an interesting open question. This paper addresses this question by examining how total, collective, and localized coherence are affected by acceleration and coupling strength. Our analysis reveals that both total and collective coherence significantly decrease with increasing acceleration and coupling strength, ultimately vanishing at high levels of acceleration. This underscores the profound impact of Unruh thermal noise. Conversely, localized coherence exhibits relative stability, decreasing to zero only under the extreme condition of infinite acceleration. Moreover, we demonstrate that collective, localized, and basis-independent coherence collectively satisfy the triangle inequality. These findings are crucial for enhancing our understanding of quantum information dynamics in environments subjected to high acceleration and offer valuable insights on the behavior of quantum coherence under relativistic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oblivious transfer has been the interest of study as it can be used as a building block for multiparty computation. There are many forms of oblivious transfer; we explore a variant known as Rabin oblivious transfer. Here the sender Alice has one bit, and the receiver Bob obtains this bit with a certain probability. The sender does not know whether the receiver obtained the bit or not. For a previously suggested protocol, we show a possible attack using a delayed measurement. This allows a cheating party to pass tests carried out by the other party, while gaining more information than if they would have been honest. We show how this attack allows perfect cheating, unless the protocol is modified, and suggest changes which lower the cheating probability for the examined cheating strategies.</description>

      <title>Maximal steered coherence in the background of Schwarzschild space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, the exploration of quantumness within Schwarzschild spacetime has garnered significant interest, particularly regarding the Hawking radiation's impact on quantum correlations and quantum coherence. Building on this foundation, we investigate how Hawking radiation influences maximal steered coherence (MSC)-a crucial measure for gauging the ability to generate coherence through steering. We find that as the Hawking temperature increases, the physically accessible MSC degrade while the unaccessible MSC increase. This observation is attributed to a redistribution of the initial quantum correlations, previously acknowledged by inertial observers, across all bipartite modes. In particular, we find that in limit case that the Hawking temperature tends to infinity, the accessible MSC equals to 1/\sqrt{2} of its initial value, and the unaccessible MSC also equals to the same value. Our findings illuminate the intricate dynamics of quantum information in the vicinity of black holes, suggesting that Hawking radiation plays a pivotal role in reshaping the landscape of quantum coherence and entanglement in curved spacetime. This study not only advances our theoretical understanding of black hole thermodynamics but also opens new avenues for investigating the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity.</description>

      <title>If Mixed States Are Secretly Quickly Oscillating Pure States, Weak Measurements Can Detect It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent nonunitary evolution in the black hole information paradox and recent work on describing wavefunction collapse via nonunitary nonlinear stochastic operators has motivated us to analyze whether mixed states can be distinguished from quickly oscillating pure states. We have demonstrated that the answer is no for all practical purposes if only strong nonpostselected measurements are performed. However, if weak measurements in postselected systems are used, mixed states and quickly oscillating states produce different results. An experimental procedure is proposed which could in principle determine the nature of mixed states stemming from blackbody radiation, decoherence, thermalization in solid state materials, Unruh radiation and Hawking radiation, among others. The analysis in this work applies to all fast oscillations, including those at Planck scale. As such, tabletop weak measurements can be used to probe (very specific) potential high energy behavior, where strong nonpostselected measurements cannot be applied. This work also demonstrates that weak measurements are not equivalent to a set of strong measurements without postselection since measurements which are impossible for all practical purposes need to be excluded.</description>

      <title>Technology and Performance Benchmarks of IQM's 20-Qubit Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has tremendous potential to overcome some of the fundamental limitations present in classical information processing. Yet, today's technological limitations in the quality and scaling prevent exploiting its full potential. Quantum computing based on superconducting quantum processing units (QPUs) is among the most promising approaches towards practical quantum advantage.
  In this article the basic technological approach of IQM Quantum Computers is described covering both the QPU and the rest of the full-stack quantum computer. In particular, the focus is on a 20-qubit quantum computer featuring the Garnet QPU and its architecture, which we will scale up to 150 qubits. We also present QPU and system-level benchmarks, including a median 2-qubit gate fidelity of 99.5% and genuinely entangling all 20 qubits in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state.</description>

      <title>Selective Amplification of a Gravitational Wave Signal Using an Atomic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel principle for quantum sensing of gravitational waves by exploiting the collective radiative dynamics of a one-dimensional array of atoms to selectively amplify a gravitational wave signal against the incoherent and collective Minkowskian contributions. We find that, in contrast to a single atom, the collective radiative dynamics of the array is sensitive to the gravitational wave at first order in its amplitude. We demonstrate that the effective number of atoms cooperating to sense the gravitational wave scales linearly with the total number of participating atoms, up to an upper limit. As a result, the imprint of the gravitational wave in the emission rate of the array scales nearly quadratically with the number of participating atoms. Additionally, this contribution to the radiative dynamics of the array involves coherent photon emission with well-defined directionality and at frequencies shifted by the frequency of the incident gravitational wave. We discuss the feasibility of this scheme in light of current and near-future experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Momentum-entangled two-photon interference for quantum-limited transverse-displacement estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme achieving the ultimate quantum precision for the estimation of the transverse displacement between two interfering photons. Such a transverse displacement could be caused, for example, by the refracting properties of the propagation medium, or by the orientation of a system of mirrors. By performing transverse-momentum sampling interference between polarization-entangled pairs of photons that propagate with different momenta, we show that it is possible to perform transverse-displacement estimation with a precision that increases with the difference of the transverse momenta of the photons. Moreover, we show that for the estimation of small displacements, it is possible to simplify the measurement scheme replacing the transverse-momentum resolving detectors with bucket detectors without any loss in sensitivity. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that it is the quantum interference arising from two-photon entanglement in the transverse momenta at the very heart of the foreseen quantum-limited sensitivity in the spatial domain.</description>

      <title>Extendable optical phase synchronization of remote and independent quantum network nodes over deployed fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement generation between remote qubit systems is the central tasks for quantum communication. Future quantum networks will have to be compatible with low-loss telecom bands and operate with large separation between qubit nodes. Single-click heralding schemes can be used to increase entanglement rates at the cost of needing an optically phase-synchronized architecture. In this paper we present such a phase synchronization scheme for a metropolitan quantum network, operating in the low-loss telecom L-band. To overcome various challenges such as communication delays and optical power limitations, the scheme consists of multiple tasks that are individually stabilized. We characterize each task, identify the main noise sources, motivate the design choices and describe the synchronization schemes. The performance of each of the tasks is quantified by a transfer-function measurement that investigates the frequency response and feedback bandwidth. Finally we investigate the resulting optical phase stability of the fully deployed system over a continuous period of 10 hours, reporting a short-term stability standard deviation of ${\sigma} \approx 30 \deg$ and a long-term stability of the average optical phase to within a few degrees. The scheme presented served as a key enabling technology for an NV-center based metropolitan quantum link. This scheme is of interest for other quantum network platforms that benefit from an extendable and telecom compatible phase synchronization solution.</description>

      <title>Directed st-connectivity with few paths is in quantum logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a $\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\log n))$-procedure to count $st$-paths on directed graphs for which we are promised that there are at most polynomially many paths starting in $s$ and polynomially many paths ending in $t$. For comparison, the best known classical upper bound in this case just to decide $st$-connectivity is $\mathsf{DSPACE}(O(\log^2 n/ \log \log n))$. The result establishes a new relationship between $\mathsf{BQL}$ and unambiguity and fewness subclasses of $\mathsf{NL}$. Further, some preprocessing in our approach also allows us to verify whether there are at most polynomially many paths between any two nodes in $\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\log n))$. This yields the first natural candidate for a language problem separating $\mathsf{BQL}$ from $\mathsf{L}$ and $\mathsf{BPL}$. Until now, all candidates separating these classes were promise problems.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional gallium phosphide optomechanical crystal in the resolved-sideband regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faithful quantum state transfer between telecom photons and microwave frequency mechanical oscillations necessitate a fast conversion rate and low thermal noise. Two-dimensional (2D) optomechanical crystals (OMCs) are favorable candidates that satisfy those requirements. 2D OMCs enable sufficiently high mechanical frequency (1$\sim$10 GHz) to make the resolved-sideband regime achievable, a prerequisite for many quantum protocols. It also supports higher thermal conductance than 1D structures, mitigating the parasitic laser absorption heating. Furthermore, gallium phosphide (GaP) is a promising material choice thanks to its large electronic bandgap of 2.26 eV, which suppresses two-photon absorption, and high refractive index $n$ = 3.05 at the telecom C-band, leading to a high-$Q$ optical mode. Here, we fabricate and characterize a 2D OMC made of GaP. We realize a high optical $Q$-factor of $7.9\times 10^{4}$, corresponding to a linewidth $\kappa/2\pi$ = 2.5 GHz at the telecom frequency 195.6 THz. This optical mode couples to several mechanical modes, whose frequencies all exceed the cavity linewidth. The most strongly coupled mode oscillates at 7.7 GHz, more than 3 times the optical linewidth, while achieving a substantial vacuum optomechanical coupling rate $g_{\mathrm{0}}/2\pi$ = 450 kHz. This makes the platform a promising candidate for a long-lived, deterministic quantum memory for telecom photons at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Stochastically bundled dissipators for the quantum master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of open quantum systems is a fundamental topic in various scientific fields. During time propagation, the environment occasionally makes measurements, forcing the system's wave function to collapse randomly. The von Neumann density matrix incorporates the statistics involved in these random processes, and its time development is often described by Markovian quantum master equations that incorporate a dissipator. For large systems, the complexity of the dissipator grows with the increasing number of possible measurements, posing conceptual and severe computational challenges. This article introduces a stochastic representation of the dissipator, using bundled measurement operators to address this complexity. Taking the Morse oscillator as an example, we demonstrate that small samples of bundled operators capture the system's dynamics. This stochastic bundling is different from the stochastic unraveling and the jump operator formalism and offers a new way of understanding quantum dissipation and decoherence.</description>

      <title>Rate-adaptive Reconciliation for Experimental Continuous-variable Quantum Key Distribution with Discrete Modulation over a Free-space Optical Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has been proposed as a method for securely exchanging keys to protect against the security concerns caused by potential advancements in quantum computing. In addition to optical fiber transmission, free-space optical (FSO) channel is an interesting channel for CV-QKD, as it is possible to share keys over this channel wirelessly. The instability of the FSO channel caused by turbulence-induced fading, however, can cause a degradation in the system's performance. One of the most important aspects of CV-QKD is the reconciliation step, which significantly impacts the performance of the CV-QKD system. Hence, rate-adaptive reconciliation is necessary for CV-QKD over FSO to combat the fluctuations in the channel and improve secret key rates (SKRs). Therefore, in this paper, we simulate the impact of discrete modulation on the reconciliation efficiency and consider the use of $d$-dimensional reconciliation with $d &gt; 8$ to mitigate this impact, improving reconciliation efficiencies by up to 3.4%. We validate our results by experimentally demonstrating CV-QKD over a turbulent FSO link and demonstrate SKR gains by up to 165%. Furthermore, we optimise the reconciliation efficiency for FSO links, achieving additional SKR gains of up to 7.6%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information tasks, but characterizing entanglement structures in continuous variable systems remains challenging, especially in multimode non-Gaussian scenarios. In this work, we introduce a method for detecting multipartite entanglement structures in arbitrary continuous variable states, which also reveals genuine multipartite entanglement. By leveraging the quantum Fisher information, we propose a criterion for characterizing entanglement and offer a systematic approach to identify feasible operators that capture quantum correlations in multimode non-Gaussian states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on over 10000 randomly generated multimode-entangled quantum states, achieving a high success rate in entanglement detection. Additionally, our method exhibits enhanced robustness against losses by expanding the set of accessible operators. This work provides a general framework for characterizing entanglement structures in diverse continuous variable systems, enabling a number of experimentally relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Attacks via continuous measurement on the BB84 protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most important characteristic of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol is its security against third-party attacks, and the potential countermeasures available. While new types of attacks are regularly developed in the literature, they rarely involve the use of weak continuous measurement. Here, we design a new attack scheme that exploits continuous measurement together with the powerful pattern recognition capacities of deep recurrent neural networks fed by the measurement. We show that, when applied to the BB84 protocol, our attack can be difficult to notice while still allowing the spy to extract significant information about the states of the qubits sent in the quantum communication channel. Finally, we study how the spy can exploit quantum feedback based on the measurement to further cover their tracks. Our attack scheme, while still at the early stages of a toy model, constitutes a potential threat which is worthwhile to be investigated, as it could also be applied to different QKD protocols and generalized in many different ways.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Optimization using Differentiable Programming of Tensor Network States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient quantum circuit optimization schemes are central to quantum simulation of strongly interacting quantum many body systems. Here, we present an optimization algorithm which combines machine learning techniques and tensor network methods. The said algorithm runs on classical hardware and finds shallow, accurate quantum circuits by minimizing scalar cost functions. The gradients relevant for the optimization process are computed using the reverse mode automatic differentiation technique implemented on top of the time-evolved block decimation algorithm for matrix product states. A variation of the ADAM optimizer is utilized to perform a gradient descent on the manifolds of charge conserving unitary operators to find the optimal quantum circuit. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by finding the ground states of spin chain Hamiltonians for the Ising, three-state Potts and the massive Schwinger models for system sizes up to L=100. The first ten excited states of these models are also obtained for system sizes L=24. All circuits achieve high state fidelities within reasonable CPU time and modest memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sabotage Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$, the goal in the usual query model is to compute $f$ on an unknown input $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ while minimizing the number of queries to $x$. One can also consider a "distinguishing" problem denoted by $f_{\mathsf{sab}}$: given an input $x \in f^{-1}(0)$ and an input $y \in f^{-1}(1)$, either all differing locations are replaced by a $*$, or all differing locations are replaced by $\dagger$, and an algorithm's goal is to identify which of these is the case while minimizing the number of queries.
  Ben-David and Kothari [ToC'18] introduced the notion of randomized sabotage complexity of a Boolean function to be the zero-error randomized query complexity of $f_{\mathsf{sab}}$. A natural follow-up question is to understand $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})$, the quantum query complexity of $f_{\mathsf{sab}}$. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of this. The following are our main results:
  $\bullet\;\;$ If we have additional query access to $x$ and $y$, then $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})=O(\min\{\mathsf{Q}(f),\sqrt{n}\})$.
  $\bullet\;\;$ If an algorithm is also required to output a differing index of a 0-input and a 1-input, then $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})=O(\min\{\mathsf{Q}(f)^{1.5},\sqrt{n}\})$.
  $\bullet\;\;$ $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}}) = \Omega(\sqrt{\mathsf{fbs}(f)})$, where $\mathsf{fbs}(f)$ denotes the fractional block sensitivity of $f$. By known results, along with the results in the previous bullets, this implies that $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})$ is polynomially related to $\mathsf{Q}(f)$.
  $\bullet\;\;$ The bound above is easily seen to be tight for standard functions such as And, Or, Majority and Parity. We show that when $f$ is the Indexing function, $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})=\Theta(\mathsf{fbs}(f))$, ruling out the possibility that $\mathsf{Q}(f_{\mathsf{sab}})=\Theta(\sqrt{\mathsf{fbs}(f)})$ for all $f$.</description>

      <title>Entangled pairs in evaporating black holes without event horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03031v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigations into Hawking radiation often assume a black hole model featuring an event horizon, despite the growing consensus that such causal structures may not exist in nature. While this assumption is not crucial for deriving the local properties of radiation at future null infinity, it plays a significant role in discussions about Hawking partners -- the field modes that purify Hawking radiation. This article aims to explore the definition and fate of Hawking partners in black hole scenarios where semiclassical mass loss due to Hawking radiation is considered. Our analysis avoids the assumption of event horizons and instead focuses on collapse processes that feature a trapped region bounded by a dynamical horizon. We derive the form of the partners, accounting for the effects of back-scattering. Furthermore, using these results and mild assumptions, we find that Hawking partners cannot "leak" out of the dynamical horizon to partially purify the Hawking radiation in the regime where general relativity coexists semiclassically with quantum field theory. This finding emphasizes the necessity for new physics, such as quantum gravity, to resolve the final fate of information.</description>

      <title>Abelian Anyons on Flux-Quantized M5-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fractional quantum Hall systems provide the best experimental evidence yet of (abelian) anyons plausibly necessary for future fault-tolerant quantum computation, like all strongly-coupled quantum systems their physics is not deeply understood. However, generally a promising approach is to (holographically) realize such systems on branes in string/M-theory; and specifically an old argument by Hellerman &amp; Susskind gives a sketch of fractional quantum Hall states arising via discrete light cone quantization of M5/M9-brane intersections.
  Here we present a rigorous derivation of abelian anyon quantum states on M5$\perp$MO9-branes ("open M5-branes") on the discrete light cone, after globally completing the traditional local field content on the M5-worldvolume via a flux-quantization law compatible with the ambient 11d supergravity, specifically taken to be in the unstable co-Homotopy cohomology ("Hypothesis H").
  The main step in the proof uses a theorem of Okuyama to identify co-Homotopy moduli spaces with configuration spaces of strings with charged endpoints, and identifies their loop spaces with cobordism of framed links that, under topological light cone quantization, turn out to be identified with the regularized Wilson loops of abelian Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Analysis of nearly planar defects using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weiszacker model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of nearly planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal, with respect to a perfect crystal, is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. We also establish convergence of the electronic fields to the perturbation caused by the nearly planar defect. Our main finding is that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the nearly planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Capturing anharmonic effects in single vibronic level fluorescence spectra using local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics yields exact single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra from any initial vibrational level in displaced, squeezed, and Duschinsky-rotated global harmonic models. Real molecules, however, have anharmonic potential energy surfaces. To partially describe effects of anharmonicity on the spectra, we combine the Hagedorn approach to spectroscopy with the local harmonic approximation of the potential. We compute the SVL spectra for several anharmonic Morse-type potentials in one, two, and twenty dimensions and compare them to the results of global harmonic approximations and, where possible, of exact quantum calculations. We show that the local harmonic approach yields more accurate results than global harmonic approximations, especially for the emission spectra from higher initial vibrational levels.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Induced Cooling in Double Quantum Dots: Achieving Millikelvin Temperatures to Reduce Thermal Noise around Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots are emerging as a leading technology due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, maintaining these qubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems. This paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling system using microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering to achieve local temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The system utilizes microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering, combined with fast cyclic detuning of the quantum dot on-site energies and Rabi oscillations, to efficiently transfer thermal populations to the ground state, thereby surpassing natural thermal transition rates. The cooling cycle involves adjusting gate potentials to drive the system through adiabatic and diabatic transitions, complemented by microwave pulses resonant with specific energy level differences. This mechanism continuously pumps the population from excited states into the ground state, effectively reducing the system's temperature. Numerical calculations demonstrate the feasibility of achieving these low local temperatures, with detailed analysis showing the sensitivity of cooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic return time.</description>

      <title>A framework for extracting the rates of photophysical processes from biexponentially decaying photon emission data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is strong interest in designing and realizing optically-active semiconductor nanostructures of greater complexity for applications in fields ranging from biomedical engineering to quantum computing. While these increasingly complex nanostructures can implement progressively sophisticated optical functions, the presence of more material constituents and interfaces also leads to increasingly complex exciton dynamics. In particular, the rates of carrier trapping and detrapping in complex heterostructures are critically important for advanced optical functionality, but they can rarely be directly measured. In this work, we develop a model that includes trapping and release of carriers by optically inactive states. The model explains the widely observed biexponential decay of the photoluminescence signal from neutral excitons in low dimensional semiconductor emitters. The model also allows determination of likelihood intervals for all the transition rates involved in the emission dynamics, without the use of approximations. Furthermore, in cases for which the high temperature limit is suitable, the model leads to specific values of such rates, outperforming reduced models previously used to estimate those quantities. We demonstrate the value of this model by applying it to time resolved photoluminescence measurements of CdSeTe/CdS heterostructures. We obtain values not only for the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes, but also for the delayed photoluminescence originating in trapping and release.</description>

      <title>Two-Time Measurement of Entropy Transfer in Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a protocol for the two-time measurement of entropic observables in quantum open systems driven out of thermal equilibrium by coupling to several heat baths. We concentrate on the Markovian approximation of the time-evolution and relate the expected value of the so defined entropy variations with the well-known expression of entropy production due to Lebowitz and Spohn. We do so under the detailed balance condition and, as a byproduct, we show that the probabilities of outcomes of two-time measurements are given by a continuous time Markov process determined by the Lindblad generator of the Markovian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of electric field induced superradiance slowdown in ultracold Rydberg atomic gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atoms excited to electronically high-lying Rydberg states decay to low-energy states through spontaneous emission processes. We investigate the impact of a static electric field on the superradiant emission process between Rydberg $|60D_{5/2}\rangle$ and $|61P_{3/2}\rangle$ states in an ultracold Cesium Rydberg atom ensemble. We report experimental observations of a significant slowdown in superradiance upon applying an electric field. To understand the slowing down dynamics, we employ a discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) method to solve the corresponding master equation numerically. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that superradiance decoherence is caused by the Stark shifts of the Rydberg level. Our theoretical simulations qualitatively match the experimental observations. Our work provides new insights into controlling quantum critical behaviors, with implications for quantum many-body dynamics, and the study of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Timelike virtual transition in a static atom by a static mirror in Kasner Universe and in future Kruskal-Szekeres region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the Kasner regions of a Minkowski spacetime as well as region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the Kasner spacetime, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a static mirror is synchronized with Minkowski time while the static atom is using future Kasner time, $(ii)$ a static atom is using Minkowski time and the mirror is following the future Kasner time. Analogous scenarios in the black hole spacetime are -- the static mirror is using future Kruskal time while the static atom is using Schwarzschild timelike coordinate, defined inside the black hole, as its time, and vice-versa. In all of these scenarios, we observe thermal response and its periodic dependence on the separation between the atom and the mirror. These responses vanish periodically with this separation, which contrasts the scenario of uniform acceleration. We observe that the $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-Kasner responses are the same when the atomic and field frequencies are equal. At the same time, the Schwarzschild-interior and $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-Kasner are unequal for the same atomic and field frequencies. Therefore we feel that the robustness of the symmetry between the two scenarios crucially depends on the dimension as well as the curvature of the spacetime. Although qualitatively, there exist similarities to a certain degree between the responses in the Minkowski-Kasner and Schwarzschild-interior, they also carry crucial differences. We discuss the physical interpretations of these observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring van der Waals cuprate superconductors using a hybrid microwave circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of two-dimensional van der Waals materials is a frontier of condensed matter physics and quantum devices. However, characterizing such materials remains challenging due to the limitations of bulk material techniques, necessitating the development of specialized methods. In this study, we investigate the superconducting properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x flakes by integrating them with a hybrid superconducting microwave resonator. The hybrid resonator is significantly modified by the interaction with the flake while maintaining a high quality factor. We also observe a significant upshift of the resonator frequency with increasing temperature, as well as a positive nonlinearity. These effects originate from a presently unknown microscopic mechanism within the flake, and can be modeled as a two-level system bath interacting with resonant mode. Our findings open a path for high quality hybrid circuits with van der Waals flakes for exploring novel materials and developing new devices for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been investigated extensively at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian physical phenomena can emerge. In this work, we theoretically study NHSEs controlled by dissipation and interaction. We consider a 1D zigzag Bose-Hubbard lattice, subject to magnetic flux, staggered onsite single-particle loss, and uniform onsite two-particle loss. When the two-particle loss is small, two-body bound eigenstates (i.e., doublons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay of the magnetic flux and staggered single-particle loss. While, for strong two-particle loss, the localization direction of doublons is unexpectedly reversed. This is attributed to the effective strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons induced by the virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes of particle pairs with the combination of the magnetic flux, staggered single-particle loss, and strong two-particle loss. Moreover, a two-particle gain can induce the same skin-localization and reversal features of doublons, which can be utilized to dynamically observe the NHSE and its reversal of doublons controlled by interactions. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multipartite entanglement after quenches from initial states which generate multiplets of quasiparticle excitations beyond the usual pair structure. We focus on the dynamics of tripartite entanglement through the lens of the Markov gap -- a computable quantity that signals irreducible tripartite entanglement when positive. In the XX spin chain, we show that the Markov gap is positive at intermediate times, implying the presence of tripartite entanglement. After a time delay, the Markov gap increases and then decays at longer times, thus exhibiting an entanglement barrier. We argue that those qualitative features are consistent with an interpretation of the spreading of tripartite entanglement by triplets of tripartite-entangled quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Automatic Test Pattern Generation for Robust Quantum Circuit Testing</title>

Abstract: Quantum circuit testing is essential for detecting potential faults in realistic quantum devices, while the testing process itself also suffers from the inexactness and unreliability of quantum operations. This paper alleviates the issue by proposing a novel framework of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for robust testing of logical quantum circuits. We introduce the stabilizer projector decomposition (SPD) for representing the quantum test pattern, and construct the test application (i.e., state preparation and measurement) using Clifford-only circuits, which are rather robust and efficient as evidenced in the fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, it is generally hard to generate SPDs due to the exponentially growing number of the stabilizer projectors. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop an SPD generation algorithm, as well as several acceleration techniques which can exploit both locality and sparsity in generating SPDs. The effectiveness of our algorithms are validated by 1) theoretical guarantees under reasonable conditions, 2) experimental results on commonly used benchmark circuits, such as Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Quantum Volume (QV) and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) in IBM Qiskit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental evidences point to two-level defects, located in the oxides and on the interfaces of the Josephson junctions, as the major constituents of decoherence in superconducting qubits. How these defects affect the qubit evolution with the presence of external driving is less well understood since the semiclassical qubit-field coupling renders the Jaynes-Cummings model for qubit-defect coupling undiagonalizable. We analyze the decoherence dynamics in the continuous coherent state space induced by the driving and solve the master equation endowed with an extra decay-cladded driving term via a Fokker-Planck equation. The solutions for diffusion propagators as Gaussian distributions show four distinct dynamic phases: four types of convergence paths to limit cycles of varying radius by the distribution mean, which are determined by the competing external driving and the defect decays. The qubit trajectory resulted from these solutions is a super-Poissonian over displac ed Fock states, which reduces to a Gibbs state of effective temperature decided by the defect at zero driving limit. Further, the Poincare map shows the dependence of the rate of convergence on the initial state. In other words, the qubit evolution can serve as an indicator of the defect coupling strength through the variation of the driving strength as a parameter.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Boltzmann machines (QBMs) are machine-learning models for both classical and quantum data. We give an operational definition of QBM learning in terms of the difference in expectation values between the model and target, taking into account the polynomial size of the data set. By using the relative entropy as a loss function this problem can be solved without encountering barren plateaus. We prove that a solution can be obtained with stochastic gradient descent using at most a polynomial number of Gibbs states. We also prove that pre-training on a subset of the QBM parameters can only lower the sample complexity bounds. In particular, we give pre-training strategies based on mean-field, Gaussian Fermionic, and geometrically local Hamiltonians. We verify these models and our theoretical findings numerically on a quantum and a classical data set. Our results establish that QBMs are promising machine learning models.</description>

Abstract: Reducing errors in quantum gates is critical to the development of quantum computers. To do so, any distortions in the control signals should be identified, however, conventional tools are not always applicable when part of the system is under high vacuum, cryogenic, or microscopic. Here, we demonstrate a method to detect and compensate for amplitude-dependent phase changes, using the qubit itself as a probe. The technique is implemented using a microwave-driven trapped ion qubit, where correcting phase distortions leads to a three-fold improvement in single-qubit gate error, to attain state-of-the-art performance benchmarked at $1.6(4)\times 10^{-6}$ error per Clifford gate.</description>

The digital quantum simulator requires solely one- and two-qubit gates and is scalable since integrating each Hamiltonian term requires a finite (non-scaling) cost. The exact local fermion encoding we adopt relies on auxiliary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge fields by adding a pure gauge Hamiltonian term akin to the Toric Code. By numerically emulating the quantum simulator real-time dynamics, we observe a timescale separation for spin- and charge-excitations in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Hubbard ladder in the $t-J$ model limit.</description>

      <title>Taming Quantum Time Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum query complexity has several nice properties with respect to composition. First, bounded-error quantum query algorithms can be composed without incurring log factors through error reduction (exactness). Second, through careful accounting (thriftiness), the total query complexity is smaller if subroutines are mostly run on cheaper inputs -- a property that is much less obvious in quantum algorithms than in their classical counterparts. While these properties were previously seen through the model of span programs (alternatively, the dual adversary bound), a recent work by two of the authors (Belovs, Yolcu 2023) showed how to achieve these benefits without converting to span programs, by defining quantum Las Vegas query complexity. Independently, recent works, including by one of the authors (Jeffery 2022), have worked towards bringing thriftiness to the more practically significant setting of quantum time complexity.
  In this work, we show how to achieve both exactness and thriftiness in the setting of time complexity. We generalize the quantum subroutine composition results of Jeffery 2022 so that, in particular, no error reduction is needed. We give a time complexity version of the well-known result in quantum query complexity, $Q(f\circ g)=O(Q(f)\cdot Q(g))$, without log factors.
  We achieve this by employing a novel approach to the design of quantum algorithms based on what we call transducers, and which we think is of large independent interest. While a span program is a completely different computational model, a transducer is a direct generalisation of a quantum algorithm, which allows for much greater transparency and control. Transducers naturally characterize general state conversion, rather than only decision problems; provide a very simple treatment of other quantum primitives such as quantum walks; and lend themselves well to time complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Error estimation of different schemes to measure spin-squeezing inequalities</title>

Abstract: How can we analyze quantum correlations in large and noisy systems without quantum state tomography? An established method is to measure total angular momenta and employ the so-called spin-squeezing inequalities based on their expectations and variances. This allows detection of metrologically useful entanglement, but efficient strategies for estimating such nonlinear quantities have yet to be determined. In this paper we show that spin-squeezing inequalities can not only be evaluated by measurements of the total angular momentum but also by two-qubit correlations, either involving all pair correlations or randomly chosen pair correlations. Then we analyze the estimation errors of our approaches in terms of a hypothesis test. For this purpose, we discuss how error bounds can be derived for nonlinear estimators with the help of their variances, characterizing the probability of falsely detecting a separable state as entangled. We focus on the spin-squeezing inequalities in multiqubit systems. Our methods, however, can also be applied to spin-squeezing inequalities for qudits or for the statistical treatment of other nonlinear parameters of quantum states.</description>

Abstract: Optical quantum routers play a crucial role in quantum networks and have been extensively studied in both theory and experiment, leading to significant advancements in their performance. However, these routers impose stringent requirements for achieving desired routing results, as the incident photon frequency must be in strict resonance with one or several specific frequencies. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient quantum router scheme composed of semi-infinite coupled-resonator waveguide (CRW) and a giant atom. The single-channel router scheme enables stable output with 100% transfer rate over the entire energy band of the CRW. Leveraging this intriguing result, we further propose a multi-channel router scheme that possesses high stability and universality, while also being capable of performing various functionalities. The complete physical explanation of the underlying mechanism for this intriguing result is also presented. We hope that quantum router with output results unaffected by the frequency of the incoming information carriers presents a more reliable solution for the implementation of quantum networks.</description>

      <title>High-performance multiqubit system with double-transmon couplers: Toward scalable superconducting quantum computers</title>

Abstract: Tunable couplers in superconducting quantum computers have enabled fast and accurate two-qubit gates, with reported high fidelities over 99% in various architectures and gate implementation schemes. However, there are few tunable couplers whose performance in multi-qubit systems is clarified, except for the most widely used one: single-transmon coupler (STC). Achieving similar accuracy to isolated two-qubit systems remains challenging due to various undesirable couplings but is necessary for scalability. In this work, we numerically analyze a system of three fixed-frequency qubits coupled via two double-transmon couplers (DTCs) where nearest-neighbor qubits are highly detuned and also next nearest-neighbor ones are nearly resonant. The DTC is a recently proposed tunable coupler, which consists of two fixed-frequency transmons coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction. We find that the DTC can not only reduce undesired residual couplings sufficiently, as well as in isolated two-qubits systems, but also enables implementations of 30-ns CZ gates and individual and simultaneous 10-ns $\pi/2$ pulses with fidelities over 99.99%. For comparison, we also investigate the system where the DTCs are replaced by the STCs. The results show that the DTC outperforms the STC in terms of both residual coupling suppression and gate accuracy in the above systems. From these results, we expect that the DTC architecture is promising for realizing high-performance, scalable superconducting quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: High-quality, distributed quantum entanglement is the distinctive resource for quantum communication and forms the foundation for the unequalled level of security that can be assured in quantum key distribution. While the entanglement provider does not need to be trusted, the secure key rate drops to zero if the entanglement used is too noisy. In this paper, we show experimentally that QPA is able to increase the secure key rate achievable with QKD by improving the quality of distributed entanglement, thus increasing the quantum advantage in QKD. Beyond that, we show that QPA enables key generation at noise levels that previously prevented key generation. These remarkable results were only made possible by the efficient implementation exploiting hyperentanglement in the polarisation and energy-time degrees of freedom. We provide a detailed characterisation of the gain in secure key rate achieved in our proof-of-principle experiment at different noise levels. The results are paramount for the implementation of a global quantum network linking quantum processors and ensuring future-proof data security.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced wavefunction collapse</title>

Abstract: When a quantum particle moves in a curved space, a geometric potential can arise. In spite of a long history of extensive theoretical studies, to experimentally observe the geometric potential remains to be a challenge. What are the physically observable consequences of such a geometric potential? Solving the Schrodinger equation on a truncated conic surface, we uncover a class of quantum scattering states that bear a strong resemblance with the quasi-resonant states associated with atomic collapse about a Coulomb impurity, a remarkable quantum phenomenon in which an infinite number of quasi-resonant states emerge. A characteristic defining feature of such collapse states is the infinite oscillations of the local density of states (LDOS) about the zero energy point separating the scattering from the bound states. The emergence of such states in the curved (Riemannian) space requires neither a relativistic quantum mechanism nor any Coulomb impurity: they have zero angular momentum and their origin is purely geometrical - henceforth the term geometry-induced wavefunction collapse. We establish the collapsing nature of these states through a detailed comparative analysis of the behavior of the LDOS for both the zero and finite angular-momentum states as well as the corresponding classical picture. Potential experimental schemes to realize the geometry-induced collapse states are articulated. Not only has our study uncovered an intrinsic connection between the geometric potential and atomic collapse, it also provides a method to experimentally observe and characterize geometric potentials arising from different subfields of physics. For example, in nanoscience and nanotechnology, curved geometry has become increasingly common. Our finding suggests that wavefunction collapse should be an important factor of consideration in designing and developing nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: Problems in the field of open quantum systems often involve an environment that strongly influences the dynamics of excited states. Here we present a numerical method to model optical spectra of non-Markovian open quantum systems. The method employs a process tensor framework to efficiently compute multi-time correlations in a numerically exact way. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we compare 2D electronic spectroscopy simulations produced through our method to Markovian master equation simulations in three different system-bath coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>QUSL: Quantum Unsupervised Image Similarity Learning with Enhanced Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging quantum properties to enhance complex learning tasks has been proven feasible, with excellent recent achievements in the field of unsupervised learning. However, current quantum schemes neglect adaptive adjustments for unsupervised task scenarios. This work proposes a novel quantum unsupervised similarity learning method, QUSL. Firstly, QUSL uses similarity triplets for unsupervised learning, generating positive samples by perturbing anchor images, achieving a learning process independent of classical algorithms. Subsequently, combining the feature interweaving of triplets, QUSL employs metaheuristic algorithms to systematically explore high-performance mapping processes, obtaining quantum circuit architectures more suitable for unsupervised image similarity tasks. Ultimately, QUSL realizes feature learning with lower quantum resource costs. Comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments on quantum computers demonstrate that QUSL outperforms state-of-the-art quantum methods. QUSL achieves over 50% reduction in critical quantum resource utilization. QUSL improves similarity detection correlation by up to 19.5% across multiple datasets, exhibiting robustness in NISQ environments. While using fewer quantum resources, QUSL shows potential for large-scale unsupervised tasks.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the advantages of using autoregressive neural quantum states as ansatze for classical shadow tomography to improve its predictive power. We introduce a novel estimator for optimizing the cross-entropy loss function using classical shadows, and a new importance sampling strategy for estimating the loss gradient during training using stabilizer samples collected from classical shadows. We show that this loss function can be used to achieve stable reconstruction of GHZ states using a transformer-based neural network trained on classical shadow measurements. This loss function also enables the training of neural quantum states representing purifications of mixed states. Our results show that the intrinsic capability of autoregressive models in representing physically well-defined density matrices allows us to overcome the weakness of Pauli-based classical shadow tomography in predicting both high-weight observables and nonlinear observables such as the purity of pure and mixed states.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Optimal-Speed Quantum Evolutions: A Comparative Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of two different constructions of optimal-speed quantum Hamiltonian evolutions on the Bloch sphere. In the first approach (Mostafazadeh's approach), the evolution is specified by a traceless stationary Hermitian Hamiltonian and occurs between two arbitrary qubit states by maximizing the energy uncertainty. In the second approach (Bender's approach), instead, the evolution is characterized by a stationary Hermitian Hamiltonian which is not traceless and occurs between an initial qubit state on the north pole and an arbitrary final qubit state. In this second approach, the evolution occurs by minimizing the evolution time subject to the constraint that the difference between the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian is kept fixed. For both approaches we calculate explicitly the optimal Hamiltonian, the optimal unitary evolution operator and, finally, the optimal magnetic field configuration. Furthermore, we show in a clear way that Mostafazadeh's and Bender's approaches are equivalent when we extend Mostafazadeh's approach to Hamiltonians with nonzero trace and, at the same time, focus on an initial quantum state placed on the north pole of the Bloch sphere. Finally, we demonstrate in both scenarios that the optimal unitary evolution operator is a rotation about an axis that is orthogonal to the unit Bloch vectors that correspond to the initial and final qubit states.</description>

Abstract: Many problems intractable on classical devices could be solved by algorithms explicitly based on quantum mechanical laws, i.e. exploiting quantum information processing. As a result, increasing efforts from different fields are nowadays directed to the actual realization of quantum devices. Here we provide an introduction to Quantum Information Processing, focusing on a promising setup for its implementation, represented by molecular spin clusters known as Molecular Nanomagnets. We introduce the basic tools to understand and design quantum algorithms, always referring to their actual realization on a molecular spin architecture. We then examine the most important sources of noise in this class of systems and then one of their most peculiar features, i.e. the possibility to exploit many (more than two) available states to encode information and to self-correct it from errors via proper design of quantum error correction codes. Finally, we present some examples of quantum algorithms proposed and implemented on a molecular spin qudit hardware.</description>

Abstract: Spectral properties of bounded linear operators play a crucial role in several areas of mathematics and physics. For each self-adjoint, trace-class operator $O$ we define a set $\Lambda_n\subset \mathbb{R}$, and we show that it converges to the spectrum of $O$ in the Hausdorff metric under mild conditions. Our set $\Lambda_n$ only depends on the first $n$ moments of $O$. We show that it can be effectively calculated for physically relevant operators, and it approximates the spectrum well.
  We prove that using the above method we can converge to the minimal and maximal eigenvalues with super-exponential speed.
  We also construct monotone increasing lower bounds $q_n$ for the minimal eigenvalue (or decreasing upper bounds for the maximal eigenvalue). This sequence only depends on the moments of $O$ and a concrete upper estimate of its $1$-norm; we also demonstrate that $q_n$ can be effectively calculated for a large class of physically relevant operators. This rigorous lower bound $q_n$ tends to the minimal eigenvalue with super-exponential speed provided that $O$ is not positive semidefinite. As a by-product, we obtain computable upper bounds for the $1$-norm of $O$, too.</description>

Abstract: The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photo-damage and photo-bleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photo-damage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling non-destructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this novel methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photo-damage and photo-bleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for a new era of research and clinical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing controlled operations is fundamental to the design and execution of quantum algorithms. In quantum simulation and learning of quantum many-body systems, an important subroutine consists of implementing a controlled Hamiltonian time-evolution. Given only black-box access to the uncontrolled evolution $e^{-iHt}$, controlizing it, i.e., implementing $\mathrm{ctrl}(e^{-iHt}) = |0\langle\rangle 0|\otimes I + |1\langle\rangle 1 |\otimes e^{-iHt}$ is non-trivial. Controlization has been recently used in quantum algorithms for transforming unknown Hamiltonian dynamics [OKTM24] leveraging a scheme introduced in Refs. [NSM15, DNSM21]. The main idea behind the scheme is to intersperse the uncontrolled evolution with suitable operations such that the overall dynamics approximates the desired controlled evolution. Although efficient, this scheme uses operations randomly sampled from an exponentially large set. In the present work, we show that more efficient controlization schemes can be constructed with the help of orthogonal arrays for unknown 2-local Hamiltonians. This construction can also be generalized to $k$-local Hamiltonians. Moreover, our controlization schemes based on orthogonal arrays can take advantage of the interaction graph's structure and be made more efficient.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy--the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits--within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using state-of-the-art numerics based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling work extraction at a generic time (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between local ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Chiral-Extended Photon-Emitter Dressed States in Non-Hermitian Topological Baths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of quantum emitters and non-Hermitian structured baths has received increasing attention in recent years. Here, we predict unconventional quantum optical behaviors of quantum emitters coupled to a non-Hermitian topological bath, which is realized in a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic chain subjected to nonlocal dissipation. In addition to the Hermitian-like chiral bound states in the middle line gap and skin-mode-like hidden bound states inside the point gap, we identify peculiar in-gap chiral and extended photon-emitter dressed states. This is due to the competition of topological-edge localization and non-Hermitian skin-mode localization in combination with the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, when two emitters are coupled to the same bath, such in-gap dressed states can mediate the nonreciprocal long-range emitter-emitter interactions, with the interaction range limited only by the dissipation of the bath. Our work opens the door to further study rich quantum optical phenomena and exotic many-body physics utilizing quantum emitters coupled to non-Hermitian topological baths.</description>

Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics under an oscillating electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron oscillating under the field is asymmetric with respect to the direction of its forward movement. Since emission of each photon is accompanied by momentum transfer to the electron, such a skew emission leads to the quantum recoil force decelerating the electron. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for various electronic systems driven by laser irradiation.</description>

      <title>From Entanglement Purification Scheduling to Fidelity-constrained Multi-Flow Routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently emerged as a disruptive networking paradigm, quantum networks rely on the mysterious quantum entanglement to teleport qubits without physically transferring quantum particles. However, the state of quantum systems is extremely fragile due to environment noise. A promising technique to combat against quantum decoherence is entanglement purification. To fully exploit its benefit, two fundamental research questions need to be answered: (1) given an entanglement path, what is the optimal entanglement purification schedule? (2) how to compute min-cost end-to-end entanglement paths subject to fidelity constraint? In this paper, we give algorithmic solutions to both questions. For the first question, we develop an optimal entanglement purification scheduling algorithm for the single-hop case and analyze the \textsc{purify-and-swap} strategy in the multi-hop case by establishing the closed-form condition for its optimality. For the second question, we design a polynomial-time algorithm constructing an $\epsilon$-optimal fidelity-constrained path. The effectiveness of our algorithms are also numerically demonstrated by extensive simulations.</description>

Abstract: We review the correspondence between a synchronous game and its associated game algebra. We slightly develop the work of Helton et al.[HMPS17] by proposing results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the theoretical works on noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze [BWHK23], we build computational tools involving Gr\"obner basis method and semidefinite programming to check the existence of perfect strategies with specific models. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models proposed in [HMPS17]. We also extend Ji's reduction $\texttt{3-Coloring}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$ [Ji13] and exhibit another instance of quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{Clique}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$.</description>

      <title>Scalable parallel measurement of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of 10 NV centers in parallel. Further, we show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 10 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 45 unique correlation coefficients. We conclude by discussing how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable high-throughput experiments with individual spin defects, and provide a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.</description>

      <title>Does Bell's theorem apply if perceived pseudo-Euclidean space is emergent?</title>

      <description>arXiv:quant-ph/0105020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) showed that it is possible to predict with certainty the value of a property without disturbing the object in question. In contrast, Quantum Mechanics (QM) holds that if different measurement setups cannot coexist, then predictions about those can neither. Using an EPR-inspired experiment with distantly separated measurements on pairs of entangled spinning particles, Bell proved that no local hidden variable (HV) theory can describe reality in more detail than QM. However, it is possible to conceive a viable HV theory based on the assumption that the perceived structure of spacetime is emergent from a hidden curved spacetime. According to this theory, locality can be maintained for each of the measurements while what is perceived as non-locality can be ascribed to the emergence of spacetime correlations between the instruments of the two parties. The theory predicts correlations that agree with QM, provided that the hidden spacetime has three spatial dimensions. If it had fewer than three dimensions, the CHSH inequality would not be violated and if more, Tsirelson's bound would be violated. According to this HV theory, the laboratory frame of reference is a corollary of correlations of the type that are the subject of Bell's thought experiment.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions and cat states in cavity-coupled quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study double quantum dots coupled to a quasistatic cavity mode with high mode-volume compression allowing for strong light-matter coupling. Besides the cavity-mediated interaction, electrons in different double quantum dots interact with each other via dipole-dipole (Coulomb) interaction. For attractive dipolar interaction, a cavity-induced ferroelectric quantum phase transition emerges leading to ordered dipole moments. Surprisingly, we find that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous, depending on the ratio between the strengths of cavity-mediated and Coulomb interactions. We show that, in the strong coupling regime, both the ground and the first excited states of an array of double quantum dots are squeezed Schr\"{o}dinger cat states. Such states are actively discussed as high-fidelity qubits for quantum computing, and thus our proposal provides a platform for semiconductor implementation of such qubits. We also calculate gauge-invariant observables such as the net dipole moment, the optical conductivity, and the absorption spectrum beyond the semiclassical approximation.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical description to relate the universal term to the effective ground-state degeneracy known as the $g$ function in a boundary conformal field theory, and use the renormalization group method to determine its value. We show that the universal contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement. Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no postselections, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Young double-slit interference with single hard x-ray photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young double-slit experiments using monochromatic hard X-rays with the energy of 25 keV are presented. The experiments were performed at a synchrotron source with a distance of 110 m between the interferometer and the detector to produce an interference pattern with a sufficiently broad period that could be adequately sampled by a photon-counting detector with 75 micrometre pixels. In the single-particle version of the experiment, over one million image frames with a single registered photon in each one were collected. The sum of these frames showed a clear presence of the interference pattern with the expected period. Subsequent analysis provided an objective estimation of the minimal number of detected photons required to determine, in accordance with the Rose criterion, the presence of the photon interference. Apart from a general theoretical interest, these investigations were aimed at exploring the possibility of medical X-ray phase-contrast imaging in photon-counting mode at minimal radiation doses.</description>

      <title>Irregular Bloch Zener oscillations in two-dimensional flat-band Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a static electrical field is applied to a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac material, Landau-Zener transition (LZT) and Bloch-Zener oscillations can occur. Employing alpha-T3 lattices as a paradigm for a broad class of 2D Dirac materials, we uncover two phenomena. First, due to the arbitrarily small energy gaps near a Dirac point that make it more likely for LZTs to occur than in other regions of the Brillouin zone, the distribution of differential LZT probability in the momentum space can form a complicated morphological pattern. Second, a change in the LZT morphology as induced by a mutual switching of the two distinct Dirac points can lead to irregular Bloch-Zener oscillations characterized by a non-smooth behavior in the time evolution of the electrical current density associated with the oscillation. These phenomena are due to mixed interference of quantum states in multiple bands modulated by the geometric and dynamic phases. We demonstrate that the adiabatic-impulse model describing Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferometry can be exploited to calculate the phases, due to the equivalence between the alpha-T3 lattice subject to a constant electrical field and strongly periodically driven two- or three-level systems. The degree of irregularity of Bloch-Zener oscillations can be harnessed by selecting the morphology pattern, which is potentially experimentally realizable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of spin-dependent quantum scattering in two-dimensional (2D) pseudospin-1/2 Dirac materials leading to a relativistic quantum chimera was recently uncovered. We investigate spin-dependent Dirac electron optics in 2D pseudospin-1 Dirac materials, where the energy-band structure consists of a pair of Dirac cones and a flat band. In particular, with a suitable combination of external electric fields and a magnetic exchange field, electrons with a specific spin orientation (e.g., spin-down) can be trapped in a class of long-lived edge modes, generating resonant scattering. The spin-dependent edge states are a unique feature of flat-band Dirac materials and have no classical correspondence. However, electrons with the opposite spin (i.e., spin up) undergo conventional quantum scattering with a classical correspondence, which can be understood in the framework of Dirac electron optics. A consequence is that the spin-down electrons produce a large scattering probability with broad scattering angle distribution in both near- and far-field regions, while the spin-up electrons display the opposite behavior. Such characteristically different behaviors of the electrons with opposite spins lead to spin polarization that can be as high as nearly 100%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spread complexity in two-mode Bose-Einstein condensations and unveil that the long-time average of the spread complexity $\overline{C}_{K}$ can probe the dynamical transition from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. When the parameter $\omega$ increases over a critical value $\omega_{c}$, we reveal that the spread complexity exhibits a sharp transition from lower to higher value, with the corresponding phase space trajectory changing from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. Moreover, we scrutinize the eigen-spectrum and uncover the relation between the dynamical transition and the excited state quantum phase transition, which is characterized by the emergence of singularity in the density of states at critical energy $E_{c}$. In the thermodynamical limit, the cross point of $E_{c}(\omega)$ and the initial energy $E_{0}(\omega)$ determines the dynamical transition point $\omega_{c}$. Furthermore, we show that the different dynamical behavior for the initial state at a fixed point can be distinguished by the long-time average of the spread complexity, when the fixed point changes from unstable to stable. Finally, we also examine the sensitivity of $\overline{C}_{K}$ for the triple-well bosonic model which exibits the transition from chaotic dynamics to regular dynamics.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the critical gravitational collapse produces continuous self-similar solutions characterized by the Choptuik critical exponent, $\gamma$. We examine the solutions in the domains of the linear perturbation equations, considering the numerical measurement errors. Specifically, we study quantum perturbation theory for the four-dimensional Einstein-axion-dilaton system of the elliptic class of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ transformations. We develop a novel artificial neural network-assisted Metropolis-Hastings algorithm based on quantum perturbation theory to find the distribution of the critical exponent in a Bayesian framework. Unlike existing methods, this new probabilistic approach identifies the available deterministic solution and explores the range of physically distinguishable critical exponents that may arise due to numerical measurement errors.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Quantum Non-local Neural Network for Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Non-local operations play a crucial role in computer vision enabling the capture of long-range dependencies through weighted sums of features across the input, surpassing the constraints of traditional convolution operations that focus solely on local neighborhoods. Non-local operations typically require computing pairwise relationships between all elements in a set, leading to quadratic complexity in terms of time and memory. Due to the high computational and memory demands, scaling non-local neural networks to large-scale problems can be challenging. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical scalable non-local neural network, referred to as Quantum Non-Local Neural Network (QNL-Net), to enhance pattern recognition. The proposed QNL-Net relies on inherent quantum parallelism to allow the simultaneous processing of a large number of input features enabling more efficient computations in quantum-enhanced feature space and involving pairwise relationships through quantum entanglement. We benchmark our proposed QNL-Net with other quantum counterparts to binary classification with datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. The simulation findings showcase our QNL-Net achieves cutting-edge accuracy levels in binary image classification among quantum classifiers while utilizing fewer qubits.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order</title>

Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases), and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</description>

      <title>Phase-Based Approaches for Rapid Construction of Magnetic Fields in NV Magnetometry</title>

Abstract: With the second quantum revolution underway, quantum-enhanced sensors are moving from laboratory demonstrations to field deployments, providing enhanced and even new capabilities. Signal processing and operational software is becoming integral parts of these emerging sensing systems to reap the benefits of this progress. This paper looks into widefield Nitrogen Vacancy Center-based magnetometry and focuses on estimating the magnetic field from the Optically Detected Magnetic Resonances (ODMR) signal, a crucial output for various applications. Mapping the shifts of ODMR signals to phase estimation, a computationally efficient approaches are proposed. Involving Fourier Transform and Filtering as pre-processing steps, the suggested approaches involve linear curve fit or complex frequency estimation based on well-known super-resolution technique Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). The existing methods in the quantum sensing literature take different routes based on Lorentzian fitting for determining magnetic field maps. To showcase the functionality and effectiveness of the suggested techniques, relevant results, based on experimental data are provided, which shows a significant reduction in computational time with the proposed method over existing methods</description>
