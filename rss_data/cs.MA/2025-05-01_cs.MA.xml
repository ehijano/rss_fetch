      <title>TinyMA-IEI-PPO: Exploration Incentive-Driven Multi-Agent DRL with Self-Adaptive Pruning for Vehicular Embodied AI Agent Twins Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI) addresses autonomous driving challenges in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks (VEANETs) through multi-modal perception, adaptive decision-making, and hardware-software co-scheduling. However, the computational demands of virtual services and the inherent mobility of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitate real-time migration of Vehicular Embodied Agent AI Twins (VEAATs) between resource-constrained Roadside Units (RSUs). This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient VEAAT migration in VEANETs, combining a multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game-theoretic incentive mechanism with a tiny multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. First, We propose an virtual immersive experience-driven utility model that captures AV-RSU dynamic interactions by integrating AVs' social influence, service complementarity and substitutability, and RSUs' resource allocation strategies to optimize VEAAT migration decisions. Second, to enhance training efficiency and enable efficient deployment on computation-constrained AVs while preserving exploration-exploitation performance, we propose TinyMA-IEI-PPO, a self-adaptive dynamic structured pruning algorithm that dynamically adjusts neuron importance based on agents' exploration incentives. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves convergence comparable to baseline models and closely approximates the Stackelberg equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Which Agent Causes Task Failures and When? On Automated Failure Attribution of LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&amp;When dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive error steps. Using the Who&amp;When, we develop and evaluate three automated failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and the need for further research in this area.

      <title>Emergence of Roles in Robotic Teams with Model Sharing and Limited Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach, this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment without the need for explicit communication between agents.</description>

      <title>Position Paper: Towards Open Complex Human-AI Agents Collaboration System for Problem-Solving and Knowledge Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position paper critically surveys a broad spectrum of recent empirical developments on human-AI agents collaboration, highlighting both their technical achievements and persistent gaps. We observe a lack of a unifying theoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies, especially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the technical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic feedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing contributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents to hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical Exploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy methods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative paradigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving equally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a forward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses. Together, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of human cognition and AI capability.</description>

      <title>Urban Air Mobility as a System of Systems: An LLM-Enhanced Holonic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution. Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability, and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.</description>

      <title>UserCentrix: An Agentic Memory-augmented AI Framework for Smart Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI, with its autonomous and proactive decision-making, has transformed smart environments. By integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and multi-agent systems, modern AI frameworks can dynamically adapt to user preferences, optimize data management, and improve resource allocation. This paper introduces UserCentrix, an agentic memory-augmented AI framework designed to enhance smart spaces through dynamic, context-aware decision-making. This framework integrates personalized Large Language Model (LLM) agents that leverage user preferences and LLM memory management to deliver proactive and adaptive assistance. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid hierarchical control system, balancing centralized and distributed processing to optimize real-time responsiveness while maintaining global situational awareness. UserCentrix achieves resource-efficient AI interactions by embedding memory-augmented reasoning, cooperative agent negotiation, and adaptive orchestration strategies. Our key contributions include (i) a self-organizing framework with proactive scaling based on task urgency, (ii) a Value of Information (VoI)-driven decision-making process, (iii) a meta-reasoning personal LLM agent, and (iv) an intelligent multi-agent coordination system for seamless environment adaptation. Experimental results across various models confirm the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing response accuracy, system efficiency, and computational resource management in real-world application.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Traffic Simulation with Guided Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However, existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation of autonomous driving systems.</description>
