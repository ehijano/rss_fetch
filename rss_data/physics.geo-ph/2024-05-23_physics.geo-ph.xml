      <title>Granular temperature controls local rheology of vibrated granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to demonstrate a local rheology for sheared, vibrated granular flows. We consider a granular assembly that is subjected to simple shear and harmonic vibration at the boundary. This configuration allows us to isolate the effects of vibration, as parameterized by granular temperature. We find that friction is reduced due to local velocity fluctuations of grains. All data obey a local rheology that relates the material friction coefficient, the granular temperature, and the dimensionless shear rate. We also observe that reduction in material friction due to granular temperature is associated with reduction in fabric anisotropy. We demonstrate that the temperature can be modeled by a heat equation with dissipation with appropriate boundary conditions, which provides complete closure of the system and allows a fully local continuum description of sheared, vibrated granular flows. This success suggests local rheology based on temperature, as suggested previously, combined with the new, empirical heat diffusion equation may provide a general strategy for dense granular flows.</description>

      <title>Interpolation and synthesis of sparse samples in exoplanet atmospheric modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper highlights methods from geostatistics that are relevant to the interpretation, intercomparison, and synthesis of atmospheric model data, with a specific application to exoplanet atmospheric modeling. Climate models are increasingly used to study theoretical and observational properties of exoplanets, which include a hierarchy of models ranging from fast and idealized models to those that are slower but more comprehensive. Exploring large parameter spaces with computationally-expensive models can be accomplished with sparse sampling techniques, but analyzing such sparse samples can pose challenges for conventional interpolation functions. Ordinary kriging is a statistical method for describing the spatial distribution of a data set in terms of the variogram function, which can be used to interpolate sparse samples across any number of dimensions. Variograms themselves may also be useful diagnostic tools for describing the spatial distribution of model data in exoplanet atmospheric model intercomparison projects. Universal kriging is another method that can synthesize data calculated by models of different complexity, which can be used to combine sparse samples of data from slow models with larger samples of data from fast models. Ordinary and universal kriging can also provide a way to synthesize model predictions with sparse samples of exoplanet observations and may have other applications in exoplanet science.</description>
