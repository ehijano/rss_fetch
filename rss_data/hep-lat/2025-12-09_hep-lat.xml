      <title>HoloNet: Toward a Unified Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Framework of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose HoloNet, a neural-network framework that unifies lattice QCD(LQCD) thermodynamics and holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory within a data-to-holography pipeline. Instead of assuming specific functional forms, HoloNet learns the metric profile $A(z)$ and the gauge-dilaton coupling $f(\phi)$ directly from 2+1-flavor LQCD data at $\mu=0$. These learned functions are embedded into the EMD equations, enabling the model to reproduce the lattice equation of state and baryon number fluctuations with high fidelity. Once trained, HoloNet provides a fully data-driven holographic description of QCD that extends naturally to finite density, allowing us to map the phase diagram and estimate the location of the critical end point (CEP). The reconstructed potential $V(\phi)$ and coupling $f(\phi)$ agree quantitatively with those obtained from holographic renormalization, demonstrating that HoloNet can consistently bridge different holographic models.</description>

      <title>Pion and Kaon PDFs from Lattice QCD with Complementary Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a first-principles lattice-QCD calculation of the unpolarized quark PDF for the pion and the kaon. The lattice data rely on matrix elements calculated for boosted mesons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line. The calculations on this lattice ensemble correspond to two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$), using maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice volume is $32^3\times 64$, with a lattice spacing of 0.0934 fm, and a pion mass of 260 MeV. Matrix elements are calculated for hadron boosts of $|P_3| = 0,~0.41,~0.83,~1.25,~1.66,$ and 2.07 GeV. To match lattice QCD results to their light-cone counterparts, we employ two complementary frameworks: the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and the short-distance factorization (SDF). Using these approaches in parallel, we also test the lattice data to identify methodology-driven systematics. Results are presented for the standard quark PDFs, as well as the valence sector. Beyond obtaining the PDFs, we also explore the possibility of extracting information on SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. For LaMET, we also parametrize the momentum dependence to obtain the infinite-momentum PDFs.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical phenomena of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4,5$ and 6 are investigated using the technique of supervised neural network (NN). Unlike the conventional NN approaches, here we train a multilayer perceptron consisting of only one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer with two artificially made stagger-like configurations. Remarkably, despite the fact that the MLP is trained without any input from these considered models, it correctly identifies the critical temperatures of the studied physical systems. Particularly, the MLP outcomes suggest convincingly that the $q=3$ model is critical only at zero temperature and $q=4,5,6$ models remain disordered at all temperatures. Previously, this MLP has been successfully applied to uncover the nature of the phase transitions of 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine whether the already trained MLP can detect other models with untypical critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Polyakov loop model with exact static quark determinant in the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit: SU(N) case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution of the $d$-dimensional $SU(N)$ Polyakov loop model with the exact static quark determinant at finite temperature and non-zero baryon chemical potential in the 't~Hooft--Veneziano limit. In the joint large-$N$, large-$N_f$ limit with fixed ratio $\kappa = N_f/N$, the mean-field approximation becomes exact, and the core of the Polyakov loop model reduces to a deformed unitary matrix model, which we solve analytically. In particular, we compute the free energy and its derivatives, the expectation values of the Polyakov loop, and the baryon density, and we describe the phase diagram of the model in detail. We show how the $SU(N)$ case differs from the corresponding $U(N)$ model and how the three-phase structure known from one-dimensional QCD at finite density extends to non-zero coupling.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector molecules $\Upsilon B_{c}^{-}$ and $\eta_{b}B_{c}^{\ast-} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axial-vector hadronic molecules $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}=\Upsilon B_{c}^{-} $ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_{\mathrm{AV}}=\eta_{b}B_{c}^{\ast -} $ with the quark content $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are studied using QCD sum rule method. The spectroscopic parameters of these molecules are computed in the context of the two-point sum rule method. Predictions for their masses are identical to each other and confirm that they are structures unstable against dissociations to ordinary heavy mesons. We evaluate the width of the state $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ and assume that it is equal to that of $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_{\mathrm{AV}} $. To this end, we explore its dominant decay channels $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}} \to \Upsilon B_{c}^{-} $ and $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}} \to \eta_{b}B_{c}^{\ast -}$. There also are subleading modes of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ generated due to annihilation of $\overline{b}b$ quarks. We consider decays of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ to pairs of the mesons $B^{\ast -} \overline{D}^{0}$, $\overline{B}^{\ast 0} D^{-}$, $B^{-} \overline{D} ^{\ast 0}$, $\overline{B}^{0} D^{\ast -}$, $\overline{B}_{s}^{\ast 0} D_{s}^{-}$, and $\overline{B}_{s}^{0} D_{s}^{\ast -}$. To find strong couplings at the $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$-meson-meson vertices which determine the partial widths of these processes, we apply QCD three-point sum rule approach. The mass $m=(15800 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma [\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}]=(112 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the molecule $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ are useful for experimental studies of fully heavy molecular structures at ongoing and planning experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral transition in a Non-Abelian Quasi-Particle Model with three quark flavours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the recently introduced Non-Abelian Quasi-Particle Model (NAQPM) for gluons with an ideal Fermi gas of three quark species with the aim to describe the equation of state (energy density vs. temperature) of $2+1$ - flavour Lattice-QCD at zero chemical potential. Allowing temperature dependent masses for the fermions, we show that above a critical temperature $T_c$ the quark mass has to drop rapidly in order to obtain energy density values compatible with the Lattice-QCD results. Within this framework, thus, the restoration of chiral symmetry in the system is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gluon variance -- which is a fundamental quantity of the NAQPM -- is strongly correlated to the fermion mass and decreases by orders of magnitude through the transition. The high temperature phenomenological characteristics of the gluon appear consistent to properties of the perturbative QCD gluon. The model indicates that color deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are interrelated and classical configurations of the QCD dynamics play an important role to the criticality of the system.</description>

      <title>Topological Susceptibility and QCD Axion Mass: QED and NNLO corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.01008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the precision of the topological susceptibility of QCD, and therefore of the QCD axion mass, by including $O(\alpha_{\rm em})$ and NNLO corrections in the chiral expansion, which amount to 0.65(21)% and -0.71(29)% respectively. Both corrections are one order of magnitude smaller than the known NLO ones, confirming the very good convergence of the chiral expansion and its reliability. Using the latest estimates for the light quark masses the current uncertainty is dominated by the one of the low-energy constant $\ell_7$. When combined with possible improvements on the light quark mass ratio and $\ell_7$ from lattice QCD, our computation could allow to determine the QCD axion mass with per-mille accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Shape Invariance: Numerical Bootstrap as a Detector of Solvable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the solvability of a given quantum mechanical system is generally challenging. We discuss that the numerical bootstrap method can help us to solve this question in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. We show that the bootstrap method can derive exact energy eigenvalues in systems with shape invariance, which is a sufficient condition for solvability and which many solvable systems satisfy. The information of the annihilation operators is also obtained naturally, and thus the bootstrap method tells us why the system is solvable. We numerically demonstrate this explicitly for shape invariant potentials: harmonic oscillators, Morse potentials, Rosen-Morse potentials and hyperbolic Scarf potentials. Therefore, the numerical bootstrap method can determine the solvability of a given unknown system if it satisfies shape invariance.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry breaking in Georgi-Glashow chiral-gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical symmetry breaking in a class of chiral gauge theories containing the Georgi-Glashow model. These theories feature a gauge sector and two fermion species that transform in the two-index antisymmetric and antifundamental representations with different multiplicities. Using the effective action formalism and the functional renormalization group, we derive the flow of four-fermion interactions that encode their resonant structure and information about bound-state formation. Generalizing the theories to multiple generations, we make contact with the loss of asymptotic freedom and dissect the boundary of a conjectured conformal window. Our results show that, while most of the theory space displays a dominant color-breaking condensate, there exists a strongly coupled regime where the lowest-laying mechanisms fail and more intricate dynamics are expected to arise. This analysis provides a first step toward the infrared behavior of chiral gauge theories with functional methods.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>
