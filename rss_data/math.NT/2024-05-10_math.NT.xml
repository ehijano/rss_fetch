      <title>Divisibility of an analogue of $t$-core partition function by powers of primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partition of a positive integer $n$ is said to be $t$-core if none of its hook lengths are divisible by $t$. Recently, two analogues, $\overline{a}_t(n)$ and $\overline{b}_t(n)$, of the $t$-core partition function, $c_t(n)$, have been introduced by Gireesh, Ray and Shivashankar \cite{grs} and Bandyopadhyay and Baruah \cite{bb}, respectively. In this article, we prove the lacunarity of $\overline{b}_t(n)$ modulo arbitrary powers of 2 and 3 for $t=3^\alpha m$ where $\gcd(m,6)$=1. For a fixed positive integer $k$ and prime numbers $p_i\geq 5$, we also study the arithmetic density of $\overline{b}_t(n)$ modulo $p_i^k$ where $t=p_1^{a_1}\cdots p_m^{a_m}$. We further prove an infinite family of congruences for $\overline{b}_3(n)$ modulo arbitrary powers of 2 by employing a result of Ono and Taguchi on the nilpotency of Hecke operators.</description>

      <title>On Transcendence of Numbers Related to Sturmian and Arnoux-Rauzy Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider numbers of the form $S_\beta(\boldsymbol{u}):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{u_n}{\beta^n}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}=\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ is an infinite word over a finite alphabet and $\beta\in \mathbb{C}$ satisfies $|\beta|&gt;1$. Our main contribution is to present a combinatorial criterion on $\boldsymbol u$, called echoing, that implies that $S_\beta(\boldsymbol{u})$ is transcendental whenever $\beta$ is algebraic. We show that every Sturmian word is echoing, as is the Tribonacci word, a leading example of an Arnoux-Rauzy word. We furthermore characterise $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-linear independence of sets of the form $\left\{ 1, S_\beta(\boldsymbol{u}_1),\ldots,S_\beta(\boldsymbol{u}_k) \right\}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}_1,\ldots,\boldsymbol{u}_k$ are Sturmian words having the same slope. Finally, we give an application of the above linear independence criterion to the theory of dynamical systems, showing that for a contracted rotation on the unit circle with algebraic slope, its limit set is either finite or consists exclusively of transcendental elements other than its endpoints $0$ and $1$. This confirms a conjecture of Bugeaud, Kim, Laurent, and Nogueira.</description>

      <title>Primitive normal Values of rational functions with one prescribed norm and trace over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q, n, m \in \mathbb{N}$ be such that $q$ is a prime power and $a, b \in \mathbb{F}$. In this article we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of a primitive normal pair $(\alpha, f(\alpha)) \in \mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ over $\mathbb{F}$ with a prescribed primitive norm $a$ and a non-zero trace $b$ over $\mathbb{F}$ of $\alpha$, where $f(x) \in \mathbb{F}_{q^m}(x)$ is a rational function of degree sum $n$ with some minor restrictions. Furthermore, for $q=7^k$, $m \geq 7$ and rational functions with numerator and denominator being linear, we explicitly find at most 6 fields in which the desired pair may not exist.</description>

      <title>New isogenies of elliptic curves over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the fields of definition of cyclic isogenies on elliptic curves to prove the following uniformity result: for any number field $F_0$ which satisfies an isogeny condition, there exists a constant $B:=B(F_0)\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that for any finite extension $L/F_0$ whose degree $[L:F_0]$ is coprime to $B$, one has for all elliptic curves $E_{/F_0}$ with $j$-invariant $\neq 0, 1728$ that any $L$-rational cyclic isogeny on $E$ must be $F_0$-rational. We also prove unconditional results for the mod-$\ell$ Galois representations of non-CM elliptic curves with an $F_0$-rational $\ell$-isogeny when $\ell$ is uniformly large.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantitative weak approximation for projective quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive asymptotic formulas for the number of rational points on a smooth projective quadratic hypersurface of dimension at least three inside of a shrinking adelic open neighbourhood. This is a quantitative version of weak approximation for quadrics and allows us to deduce the best growth rate of the size of such an adelic neighbourhood for which equidistribution is preserved.</description>

      <title>Zeta-functions of Curves over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curves over finite fields are of great importance in cryptography and coding theory. Through studying their zeta-functions, we would be able to find out vital arithmetic and geometric information about them and their Jacobians, including the number of rational points on this kind of curves. In this paper, I investigate if it is possible to construct a curve over finite fields of a given genus $g$ whose zeta-function is given as a product of zeta-functions of $g$ elliptic curves, and find out alternative methods if it is not possible. Basically, I look for conditions which those $g$ elliptic curves should satisfy such that their product (of their Jacobians) is isogenous to the Jacobian of a curve of a given genus $g$. Then from this isogenous relationship I can determine the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism of the Jacobian of the new curve and by this characteristic polynomial I can thus determine the zeta-function of this new curve. By using the zeta-functions of curves in the form as generating functions, the number of rational points on curves can even be found out, which may lead to further researches relating to some applications in cryptography, coding theory and even information theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ denotes a sufficiently large even integer, we define $D_{1,2}(N)$ as the same as those in previous articles about Chen's theorem. In this paper, we show that $D_{1,2}(N) \geqslant 1.253 \frac{C(N) N}{(\log N)^2}$, improving previous record of Wu about $40\%$. We also get similar results on twin prime problem and additive representations of integers. An important step in the proof is the application of a theorem of Lichtman.</description>

      <title>The Iwasawa $\mu$-invariant of certain elliptic curves of analytic rank zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves over the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $\mathbb{Q}^{\text{cyc}}$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. We discuss a deep conjecture of Greenberg that if $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is an elliptic curve with good ordinary reduction at $p$, and $E[p]$ is irreducible as a Galois module, then the Selmer group of $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}^{\text{cyc}}$ has $\mu$-invariant zero. We prove new cases of Greenberg's conjecture for some elliptic curves of analytic rank $0$. The proof involves studying the $p$-adic $L$-function of $E$. The crucial input is a new technique using the Rankin-Selberg method.</description>

      <title>$v$-Palindromes: An Analogy to the Palindromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around the year 2007, one of the authors, Tsai, accidentally discovered a property of the number $198$ he saw on the license plate of a car. Namely, if we take $198$ and its reversal $891$, which have prime factorizations $198 = 2\cdot 3^2\cdot 11$ and $891 = 3^4\cdot 11$ respectively, and sum the numbers appearing in each factorization getting $2+3+2+11 = 18$ and $3+4+11 = 18$, both sums are $18$. Such numbers were later named $v$-palindromes because they can be viewed as an analogy to the usual palindromes. In this article, we introduce the concept of a $v$-palindrome in base $b$ and prove their existence for infinitely many bases. We also exhibit infinite families of $v$-palindromes in bases $p+1$ and $p^2+1$, for each odd prime $p$. Finally, we collect some conjectures and problems involving $v$-palindromes.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method - named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) - was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Lang--Trotter Conjecture for CM Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and non-zero integer $r$, the Lang--Trotter conjecture predicts a striking asymptotic formula for the number of good primes $p\leqslant x$, denoted by $\pi_{E,r}(x)$, such that the Frobenius trace of $E$ at $p$ is equal to the given integer $r$. We focus on the CM case in this memoir, and show how to realize the following two goals:
  (1) to give an unconditional estimate for $\pi_{E,r}(x)$, which confirms the upper bound part of the conjecture up to a constant multiple;
  (2) to give a conditional explicit asymptotic formula for $\pi_{E,r}(x)$ based on the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture on primes represented by quadratic polynomials.
  For completeness, we also summarize classical results on quadratic, cubic and quartic residues, as well as the corresponding reciprocity laws. This part should be of independent interests and could provide useful materials for more junior readers. We also highlight some possible extensions of the arguments in this memoir that may work for other statistical problems of CM elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Maximal parahoric arithmetic transfers, resolutions and modularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any unramified quadratic extension of $p$-adic local fields $F/F_0$ $(p&gt;2)$, we formulate several arithmetic transfer conjectures at any maximal parahoric level, in the context of Zhang's relative trace formula approach to the arithmetic Gan--Gross--Prasad conjecture. The formulation involves a way to resolve the singularity of relevant moduli spaces via natural stratifications and modify derived fixed points. By a local-global method and double induction, we prove these conjectures for $F_0$ unramified over $\mathbb Q_p$, including the arithmetic fundamental lemma for $p&gt;2$. Moreover, we prove new modularity results for arithmetic theta series at parahoric levels via a method of modification over $\mathbb F_q$ and $\mathbb C$. Along the way, we study the complex and mod $p$ geometry of Shimura varieties and special cycles. We introduce the relative Cayley map and also establish Jacquet--Rallis transfers at maximal parahoric levels.</description>

      <title>Failing to hash into supersingular isogeny graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important open problem in supersingular isogeny-based cryptography is to produce, without a trusted authority, concrete examples of "hard supersingular curves" that is, equations for supersingular curves for which computing the endomorphism ring is as difficult as it is for random supersingular curves. A related open problem is to produce a hash function to the vertices of the supersingular $\ell$-isogeny graph which does not reveal the endomorphism ring, or a path to a curve of known endomorphism ring. Such a hash function would open up interesting cryptographic applications. In this paper, we document a number of (thus far) failed attempts to solve this problem, in the hope that we may spur further research, and shed light on the challenges and obstacles to this endeavour. The mathematical approaches contained in this article include: (i) iterative root-finding for the supersingular polynomial; (ii) gcd's of specialized modular polynomials; (iii) using division polynomials to create small systems of equations; (iv) taking random walks in the isogeny graph of abelian surfaces; and (v) using quantum random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the decomposition of theta series for lattice cosets of ternary lattices. We show that the natural decomposition into an Eisenstein series, a unary theta function, and a cuspidal form which is orthogonal to unary theta functions correspond to the theta series for the genus, the deficiency of the theta series for the spinor genus from that of the genus, and the deficiency of the theta series for the class from that of the spinor genus, respectively. These three pieces are hence invariants of the genus, spinor genus, and class, respectively, extending known results for lattices and verifying a conjecture of the first author and Haensch. We furthermore extend the definition of $p$-neighbors to include lattice cosets and construct an algorithm to compute respresentatives for the classes in the genus or spinor genus via the $p$-neighborhoods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce new combinatorial objects called $d$--fold partition diamonds, which generalize both the classical partition function and the partition diamonds of Andrews, Paule and Riese, and we set $r_d(n)$ to be their counting function. We also consider the Schmidt type $d$--fold partition diamonds, which have counting function $s_d(n).$ Using partition analysis, we then find the generating function for both, and connect the generating functions $\sum_{n= 0}^\infty s_d(n)q^n$ to Eulerian polynomials. This allows us to develop elementary proofs of infinitely many Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by $s_d(n)$ for various values of $d$, including the following family: for all $d\geq 1$ and all $n\geq 0,$ $s_d(2n+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{2^d}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the cyclicity problem of elliptic curves $E/\Bbb{Q}$ modulo primes in a given arithmetic progression. We extend the recent work of Akbal and G\"ulo\u{g}lu by proving an unconditional asymptotic for such a cyclicity problem over arithmetic progressions for CM elliptic curves $E$, which also presents a generalisation of the previous works of Akbary, Cojocaru, M.R. Murty, V.K. Murty, and Serre. In addition, we refine the conditional estimates of Akbal and G\"ulo\u{g}lu, which gives log-power savings (for small moduli) and consequently improves the work of Cojocaru and M.R. Murty. Moreover, we study the average exponent of $E$ modulo primes in a given arithmetic progression and obtain several conditional and unconditional estimates, extending the previous works of Freiberg, Kim, Kurlberg, and Wu.</description>

Abstract: In this article we prove that linear differential equations with only algebraic solutions have zero $m$-curvature modulo $p^k$ for all except a finite number of primes $p$ and all $k,m\in\mathbb N$ with ${\rm ord}_pm!\geq k$. This provides us with a reformulation of Grothendieck-Katz conjecture with stronger hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Problems and results on determinants involving Legendre symbols</title>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate determinants whose entries are linear combinations of Legendre symbols. After a review of known results, we present some new results and pose many conjectures for further research. For example, we conjecture that $$\det\left[x+\left(\frac{j-k}p\right)+\left(\frac jp\right)-\left(\frac kp\right)\right]_{0\le j,k\le (p-1)/2}=4$$ for any prime $p\equiv3\pmod4$, where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol.</description>
