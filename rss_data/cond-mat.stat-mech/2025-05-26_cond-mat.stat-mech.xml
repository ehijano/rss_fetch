      <title>Stochastic Heat Engine Using a Single Brownian Ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers can confine position as well as orientation of a Brownian particle by simultaneously exerting restoring force and torque on it. Here we have proposed the theoretical model of a microscopic Stirling engine, using a passive Brownian ellipsoid as its working substance. The position and the orientation degrees of freedom (DoF) of the ellipsoid in two dimensions (2D), both being confined harmonically by the tweezers, are coupled to a hot and a cold thermal bath time-periodically. The stiffness of the force confinement is also time-periodic such that it resembles a piston-like protocol which drives the Brownian ellipsoid through the strokes of a Stirling cycle. The ellipsoid takes heat from the hot bath and partially converts it into useful thermodynamic work. The extracted work and input heat shows explicit dependence on the shape of the working substance as well as its orientational bias. The operational characteristics of the anisotropic Stirling engine is analyzed using the variance in work and efficiency (in the quasi-static regime), where the latter is bounded by both the Carnot limit as well as the isotropic benchmark. Several ways have been proposed to yield maximum efficiency at a minimum fluctuation in the output. The dissipative coupling between the position and orientation of the ellipsoid, that arises due to its spherical-asymmetry (or, shape anisotropy) and a finite mean orientation, plays an important role to optimize the engine characteristics. Finally, we have analytically explored the slightly anisotropic regime, where the coupling is linearized by suitably tuning the system parameters. The average extracted work has also been calculated in this case, which shows an excellent agreement with the numerical results of the fully anisotropic system, when subjected to the stipulated range of parameters.</description>

      <title>The bridge function as a functional of the radial distribution function: Operator learning and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of classical molecular systems can be calculated with integral equation theories based on the Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation and a complementing closure relation. One such closure relation is the hyper netted chain (HNC) approximation, which neglects the so-called bridge function. We present a new way to use machine learning to train a deep operator network to predict the bridge function, based on the radial distribution function as input. Bridge functions for the Lennard-Jones fluid are calculated from Monte Carlo simulations in a wide range of densities and temperatures. These results are used to train the deep operator network. This network is employed to improve the HNC closure by the prediction for the bridge function, and the resulting set of equations is solved iteratively. For assessment, we compare the radial distribution function and the pressure, calculated by the viral expression, with Monte Carlo results and standard HNC. We demonstrate that incorporating the neural network based bridge function in the closure relation leads to substantially improved predictions. Universality of our method is demonstrated by comparing results for the hard sphere fluid, calculated with our model trained on the Lennard-Jones fluid, with exact hard sphere results, showing overall good agreement.</description>

      <title>Subsystem localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'&gt;t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties show that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. An analysis of the wavepacket dynamics shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, we also find a superdiffusive narrow crossover regime along the line separating the delocalized and localized phases. When $t'&lt;t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also a crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} (GAA) model.</description>

      <title>Ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory via mapping to point particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (BMFT) captures the evolution of fluctuations and correlations in systems where transport is strictly ballistic. We show that, for \emph{generic integrable models}, BMFT can be constructed through a direct mapping onto ensembles of classical or quantum point particles. This mapping generalises the well-known correspondence between hard spheres and point particles: the two-body \emph{scattering shift} now plays the role of an effective rod length for arbitrary interactions. Within this framework, we re-derive both the full-counting statistics and the long-range correlation functions previously obtained by other means, thereby providing a unified derivation. Our results corroborate the general picture that all late-time fluctuations and correlations stem from the initial noise, subsequently convected by Euler-scale hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic agent-based Monte Carlo simulations for reaction-diffusion models, population dynamics, and epidemic spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a succinct overview of the implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms based on Markovian stochastic dynamics to study interacting and reacting many-particle systems away from thermal equilibrium. Such agent-based computer simulations constitute an effective tool to introduce undergraduate and beginning graduate students to current frontier research without requiring much prior knowledge or experience: Starting from direct visualization of simulation data, students may gain immediate insight into emerging macroscopic features of a complex model system and subsequently apply more sophisticated data analysis to quantitatively characterize its often rich dynamical properties, both in stationary and transient regimes. We utilize numerical investigations of paradigmatic reaction-diffusion systems, as well as stochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify how interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in bottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. In addition, we give helpful hints for the practical setup of Monte Carlo simulation algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis tools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls, with tips for avoiding them.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization Through Heterogeneous Oscillator Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillator Ising machines (OIMs) are networks of coupled oscillators that seek the minimum energy state of an Ising model. Since many NP-hard problems are equivalent to the minimization of an Ising Hamiltonian, OIMs have emerged as a promising computing paradigm for solving complex optimization problems that are intractable on existing digital computers. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of tunable parameters, and convergence guarantees are mostly lacking. Here, we show that lower energy states are more likely to be stable, and that convergence to the global minimizer is often improved by introducing random heterogeneities in the regularization parameters. Our analysis relates the stability properties of Ising configurations to the spectral properties of a signed graph Laplacian. By examining the spectra of random ensembles of these graphs, we show that the probability of an equilibrium being asymptotically stable depends inversely on the value of the Ising Hamiltonian, biasing the system toward low-energy states. Our numerical results confirm our findings and demonstrate that heterogeneously designed OIMs efficiently converge to globally optimal solutions with high probability.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of enzymatic reaction-diffusion kinetics by intermediate state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological molecular motors are high-performance nanomachines that convert chemical energy into mechanical motion via chemomechanical coupling. Their reaction cycles typically comprise a series of intermediate chemical states between the initial and final primary states. However, the influence of these intermediate states on motor performance has not yet been fully explored. In this study, we investigate the impact of intermediate states on the motor kinetics using a reaction-diffusion model. In most cases, the intermediate states accelerate the motor by lowering the effective barrier height. This acceleration is particularly pronounced when an external load is applied to the motor, implying the practical importance of the intermediate states. The intermediate states can also slow down the reaction in some cases, such as the slow reaction limit with asymmetric kinetics. Our findings provide practical insights into the design principles behind the high performance of biological molecular motors, as well as the development of efficient artificial molecular motors.</description>

      <title>Lindblad evolution as gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect without global symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation and phenomena such as prethermalization and weak ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>Membrane-Associated Self-Assembly for Cellular Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular decision-making based on information received from the external environment is frequently initiated by transmembrane receptors. These receptors are known to propagate such information by triggering a series of irreversible, energy-consuming reactions. While this active mechanism ensures switch-like responses, here we show how spontaneous molecular self-assembly on a two-dimensional substrate can similarly act as a tunable and robust switch for detecting receptors at physiological concentrations. This mechanism is much more sensitive than other passive mechanisms for receptor detection. We derive analytical expressions for critical receptor densities that switch on nucleation and growth of assemblies, in close agreement with equilibrium stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations. The theory developed provides testable predictions for how each component controls decision thresholds and magnitude of response.</description>

      <title>Farm Size Matters: A Spatially Explicit Ecological-Economic Framework for Biodiversity and Pest Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17687v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intensification of European agriculture, characterized by increasing farm sizes, landscape simplification and reliance on synthetic pesticides, remains a key driver of biodiversity decline. While many studies have investigated this phenomenon, they often focus on isolated elements, resulting in a lack of holistic understanding and leaving policymakers and farmers with unclear priorities. This study addresses this gap by developing a spatially explicit ecological economic model designed to dissect the complex interplay between landscape structure and pesticide application, and their combined effects on natural enemy populations and farmers' economic returns. In particular, the model investigates how these relationships are modulated by farm size (a crucial aspect frequently overlooked in prior research). By calibrating on the European agricultural sector, we explore the ecological and economic consequences of various policy scenarios. We show that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies is strongly contingent upon farm size. Small to medium-sized farms can experience economic benefits from reduced pesticide use when coupled with hedgerow restoration, owing to enhanced natural pest control. In contrast, large farms encounter challenges in achieving comparable economic gains due to inherent landscape characteristics. This highlights the need to account for farm size in agri-environmental policies in order to promote biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability.</description>

      <title>A Magnetic-like description of Oscillatory Behavior in Chemotactic Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of chemotaxis in the movement dynamics of Aphaenogaster Senilis ants. To do so, we design an experimental setup in which individual ants are exposed to a narrow pheromone trail to guide their motion. As expected, ants locate and navigate the trail by detecting chemical scents, exhibiting a characteristic zigzag pattern, moving at a nearly constant speed while oscillating perpendicularly to the trail. The zigzagging motion is common across many species yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we propose a physical framework based on the Inertial Spin Model as an approach to quantitatively describe and explain this behavior. So, we implement chemotaxis resembling magnetic-like interactions between the ant's velocity and the pheromone gradient. Under specific approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations perpendicular to the trail, predicting a characteristic oscillatory decay. This prediction closely matches our experimental data, suggesting that the model captures the essential ingredients of ant dynamics. By fitting the model parameters to individual experimental trajectories, we further explore their potential biological significance and validate our assumptions. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of chemotaxis in ant motion and its physical features.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We include complex connectivity structures and heterogeneity in models of multilayer networks or multilayer hypergraphs growing by preferential attachment. We consider the most generic connectivity structure, where the probability of acquiring a new hyperlink depends linearly on the vector of hyperdegrees of the node across all layers, as well as on the layer of the new hyperlink and the features of both linked nodes. We derive the consistency conditions that imply a power-law hyperdegree distribution for each class of nodes within each layer and of any order. For generic connectivity structures, we predict that the exponent of the power-law distribution is universal for all layers and all orders of hyperlinks, and it depends exclusively on the type of node.</description>

      <title>Statistical Localization in a Rydberg Simulator of $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a framework for describing dynamical systems ranging from nuclei to materials. LGTs that host concatenated conservation laws can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation, where each subspace may be labeled by a conserved quantity with nonlocal operator support. It is expected that nonlocal conservation laws will not impede thermalization locally. However, this expectation has recently been challenged by the notion of statistical localization, wherein particular motifs of microscopic configurations may remain frozen in time due to strong Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the first experimental signatures of statistically-localized behavior. We realize a novel constrained LGT model using a facilitated Rydberg atom array, where atoms mediate the dynamics of electric charge clusters whose nonlocal pattern of net charges remains invariant. By experimentally reconstructing observables sampled from a temporal ensemble, we probe the spatial distribution of each conserved quantity. We find that as a result of strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the expectation values of all conserved quantities remain locally distributed in typical quantum states, even though they are described by nonlocal string-like operators. Our work opens the door to high-energy explorations of cluster dynamics and low-energy studies of strong zero modes that persist in infinite-temperature topological systems.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: Starting at the mesoscopic level with a general formulation of stochastic thermodynamics in terms of Markov jump processes, we identify the scaling conditions that ensure the emergence of a (typically nonlinear) deterministic dynamics and an extensive thermodynamics at the macroscopic level. We then use large deviations theory to build a macroscopic fluctuation theory around this deterministic behavior, which we show preserves the fluctuation theorem. For many systems (e.g. chemical reaction networks, electronic circuits, Potts models), this theory does not coincide with Langevin-equation approaches (obtained by adding Gaussian white noise to the deterministic dynamics) which, if used, are thermodynamically inconsistent. Einstein-Onsager theory of Gaussian fluctuations and irreversible thermodynamics are recovered at equilibrium and close to it, respectively. Far from equilibirum, the free energy is replaced by the dynamically generated quasi-potential (or self-information) which is a Lyapunov function for the macroscopic dynamics. Remarkably, thermodynamics connects the dissipation along deterministic and escape trajectories to the Freidlin-Wentzell quasi-potential, thus constraining the transition rates between attractors induced by rare fluctuations. A coherent perspective on minimum and maximum entropy production principles is also provided. For systems that admit a continuous-space limit, we derive a nonequilibrium fluctuating field theory with its associated thermodynamics. Finally, we coarse grain the macroscopic stochastic dynamics into a Markov jump process describing transitions among deterministic attractors and formulate the stochastic thermodynamics emerging from it.</description>

      <title>Thermalization Dynamics in Closed Quantum Many Body Systems: a Precision Large Scale Exact Diagonalization Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Krylov-subspace time evolution algorithm, we simulate the real-time dynamics of translation invariant non-integrable finite spin rings to quite long times with high accuracy. We systematically study the finite-size deviation between the resulting equilibrium state and the thermal state, and we highlight the importance of the energy variance on the deviations. We find that the deviations are well described by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and that the von Neumann entropy correction scaling is the square of the local operator scaling. We reveal also an area law contribution to the relaxed von Neumann entropy, which we connect to the mutual information between the considered subsystem and its immediate environment. We also find that local observables relax towards equilibrium exponentially with a relaxation time scale that grows linearly with system length and is somewhat independent of the local operator, but depends strongly on the energy of the initial state, with the fastest relaxation times found towards one end of the overall energy spectrum. To contrast this behaviour we also study domain wall initial states, which exhibit clear diffusive behaviour, with a Thouless time scaling quadratically with the systems size, leading to a rather precise estimate for the diffusion constant for states in the vicinity of the middle of the energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Power-law banded random matrix ensemble as a model for quantum many-body Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore interpretations of the power-law banded random matrix (PLBRM) ensemble as Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. We introduce and compare a number of labeling schemes for assigning random matrix basis indices to many-body basis vectors. We compare the physical properties of the resulting Hamiltonians, focusing on the half-system eigenstate bipartite entanglement entropy. We show and quantify how the different PLBRM phases (ergodic, weakly ergodic, localized), known from the single-particle interpretation, can be interpreted as entanglement transitions in the quantum many-body interpretation. For the weakly ergodic phase, where spectral edge and bulk eigenstates show distinct behavior, we perform a detailed scaling analysis to provide a quantitative picture of the boundaries between different types of entanglement scaling behaviors. In particular, we identify and characterize an intermediate set of eigenstates whose entanglement entropy have volume law scaling but non-vanishing deviation from the Page value expected for maximally ergodic states.</description>

      <title>Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.</description>

      <title>Very persistent random walkers reveal transitions in landscape topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the typical behavior of random walkers on the microcanonical configuration space of mean-field disordered systems. Passive walks have an ergodicity-breaking transition at precisely the energy density associated with the dynamical glass transition, but persistent walks remain ergodic at lower energies. In models where the energy landscape is thoroughly understood, we show that, in the limit of infinite persistence time, the ergodicity-breaking transition coincides with a transition in the topology of microcanonical configuration space. We conjecture that this correspondence generalizes to other models, and use it to determine the topological transition energy in situations where the landscape properties are ambiguous.</description>
