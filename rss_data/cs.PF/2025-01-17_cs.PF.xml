      <title>Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a recent breakthrough in rule-based graph programming, which allows us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the complexity of graph algorithms in conventional languages using graph transformation rules is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time O(nm) on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Transformers for Robust Acoustic Scene Classification in IoT Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices equipped with acoustic sensors necessitates robust acoustic scene classification (ASC) capabilities, even in noisy and data-limited environments. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle to generalize effectively under such conditions. To address this, we introduce Q-ASC, a novel Quantum-Inspired Acoustic Scene Classifier that leverages the power of quantum-inspired transformers. By integrating quantum concepts like superposition and entanglement, Q-ASC achieves superior feature learning and enhanced noise resilience compared to classical models. Furthermore, we introduce a Quantum Variational Autoencoder (QVAE) based data augmentation technique to mitigate the challenge of limited labeled data in IoT deployments. Extensive evaluations on the Tampere University of Technology (TUT) Acoustic Scenes 2016 benchmark dataset demonstrate that Q-ASC achieves remarkable accuracy between 68.3% and 88.5% under challenging conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by over 5% in the best case. This research paves the way for deploying intelligent acoustic sensing in IoT networks, with potential applications in smart homes, industrial monitoring, and environmental surveillance, even in adverse acoustic environments.</description>
