      <title>2D numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves using finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of steam worlds: energetic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes occupy an intriguing region of planetary mass-radius space, where theoretical models of interior structure predict that they could be water-rich, where water is in steam and supercritical state. Such planets are expected to evolve according to the same principles as canonical H$_2$-He rich planets, but models that assume a water-dominated atmosphere consistent with the interior have not been developed yet. Here, we present a state of the art structure and evolution model for water-rich sub-Neptunes. Our set-up combines an existing atmosphere model that controls the heat loss from the planet, and an interior model that acts as the reservoir of energy. We compute evolutionary tracks of planetary radius over time. We find that planets with pure water envelopes have smaller radii than predicted by previous models, and the change in radius is much slower (within $\sim$10\%). We also find that water in the deep interior is colder than previously suggested, and can transition from plasma state to superionic ice, which can have additional implications for their evolution. We provide a grid of evolutionary tracks that can be used to infer the bulk water content of sub-Neptunes. We compare the bulk water content inferred by this model and other models available in the literature, and find statistically significant differences between models when the uncertainty on measured mass and radius are both smaller than 10\%. This study shows the importance of pursuing efforts in the modeling of volatile-rich planets, and how to connect them to observations.</description>

      <title>Mechanical softening and enhanced elasticity of lunar olivine probed via nanoindentation and high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. This may be attributed to macroscopic effects, like increased porosity, or even to modifications at the chemical bond scale. We have performed high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the elastic compressibility properties on this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, on three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite, relative to terrestrial olivine. The origin of the observed differences may be the consequence of a combination of factors reflecting their complex history. The combined study by nanoindentations and HP-XRD of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue to characterize these materials that will be crucial for future extraterrestrial resource utilization purposes.</description>

      <title>Diverse dust populations in the near-Sun environment characterized by PSP/IS$\bigodot$IS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\bigodot$IS) energetic particle instrument suite on Parker Solar Probe is dedicated to measuring energetic ions and electrons in the near-Sun environment. It includes a half-sky-viewing time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EPI-Lo) and five high-energy silicon solid-state detector-telescopes (EPI-Hi). To August 2024, eight of EPI-Lo's eighty separate telescope foils have experienced direct dust puncture events, most of which occurred inside 40 solar radii (0.19 au). These impacts represent the closest ever direct dust detections to the Sun. While there is limited information about the size/mass of each impact due to the lack of a dedicated dust instrument, we can determine the impact direction for six punctures, allowing us to partially constrain the inner zodiacal abundance. Remarkably, one of six unambiguous dust impacters was likely on a retrograde orbit, suggesting long-period cometary material may survive within 20 solar radii (0.09 au). We discuss observations in the context of improving our understanding of the inner zodiacal dust environment, highlighting multiple dust populations responsible for these events, and refining hazard assessment for near-Sun spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Demise of Kreutz Sungrazing Comet C/2024 S1 (ATLAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Kreutz family sungrazing comets are discovered only days before perihelion, severely limiting observational opportunities to study their physical nature and decay. Kreutz sungrazer C/2024 S1 (ATLAS) was discovered a month before reaching its perihelion distance of 0.008 au, allowing physical observations from both ground- and space-based telescopes. We present observations from 0.9 au to 0.4 au using the Nordic Optical Telescope showing that 1) nucleus disintegration was on-going already at 0.7 au pre-perihelion, 2) the activity varied unpredictably with distance and 3) the nucleus radius was $&lt;$600 m (red geometric albedo 0.04 assumed). We also use coronagraphic observations from the STEREO-A spacecraft to study C/2024 S1 at heliocentric distances $\lesssim$0.1 au. We find that the coma scattering cross-section peaked near 0.075 au and faded progressively, by a factor $\sim$20, towards the last observation at 0.02 au. We interpret the near-perihelion fading as a result of the sublimation of refractory coma grains, beginning at blackbody temperatures $\sim$1000 K, consistent with olivine composition. The comet was not detected after perihelion. We consider processes operating to destroy the nucleus when near perihelion, concluding that rotational instability and sublimation losses work together towards this end, even before entry of the comet into the Roche lobe of the Sun.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97% of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1{\sigma} uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ , and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. The resulting precisions are 20% for ages, 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for masses, 0.01 $R_{\odot}$ for radii and 0.1 dex for surface gravities. These accurate parameters are expected to provide valuable insights for future studies on various fields.</description>
