      <title>Database for identifiability properties of linear compartmental models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural identifiability is an important property of parametric ODE models. When conducting an experiment and inferring the parameter value from the time-series data, we want to know if the value is globally, locally, or non-identifiable. Global identifiability of the parameter indicates that there exists only one possible solution to the inference problem, local identifiability suggests that there could be several (but finitely many) possibilities, while non-identifiability implies that there are infinitely many possibilities for the value. Having this information is useful since, one would, for example, only perform inferences for the parameters which are identifiable. Given the current significance and widespread research conducted in this area, we decided to create a database of linear compartment models and their identifiability results. This facilitates the process of checking theorems and conjectures and drawing conclusions on identifiability. By only storing models up to symmetries and isomorphisms, we optimize memory efficiency and reduce query time. We conclude by applying our database to real problems. We tested a conjecture about deleting one leak of the model states in the paper 'Linear compartmental models: Input-output equations and operations that preserve identifiability' by E. Gross et al., and managed to produce a counterexample. We also compute some interesting statistics related to the identifiability of linear compartment model parameters.</description>

      <title>On the Confluence of Directed Graph Reductions Preserving Feedback Vertex Set Minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In graph theory, the minimum directed feedback vertex set (FVS) problem consists in identifying the smallest subsets of vertices in a directed graph whose deletion renders the directed graph acyclic. Although being known as NP-hard since 1972, this problem can be solved in a reasonable time on small instances, or on instances having special combinatorial structure. In this paper we investigate graph reductions preserving all or some minimum FVS and focus on their properties, especially the Church-Rosser property, also called confluence.  The Church-Rosser property implies the irrelevance of reduction order, leading to a unique directed graph. The study seeks the largest subset of reductions with the Church-Rosser property and explores the adaptability of reductions to meet this criterion. Addressing these questions is crucial, as it may impact algorithmic implications, allowing for parallelization and speeding up sequential algorithms.</description>

      <title>Interval Posets and Polygon Dissections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Interval poset of a permutation is an effective way of capturing all the intervals of the permutation and the inclusions between them and was introduced recently by Tenner.  Thi paper explores the geometric interpretation of interval posets of permutations. We present a bijection between tree interval posets and convex polygons with non-crossing diagonals, offering a novel geometric perspective on this purely combinatorial concept.  Additionally, we provide an enumeration of interval posets using this bijection and demonstrate its application to block-wise simple permutations. </description>

      <title>Type-B analogue of Bell numbers using Rota's Umbral calculus approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rota used the functional L to recover old properties and obtain some new formulas for the Bell numbers. Tanny used Rota's functional L and the celebrated Worpitzky identity to obtain some expression for the ordered Bell numbers, which can be seen as an evident to the fact that the ordered Bell numbers are gamma-positive. In this paper, we extend some of Rota's and Tanny's results to the framework of the set partitions of Coxeter type B.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Dyck paths having height at most two with some constraints on the number of consecutive valleys at height one which must be followed by a suitable number of valleys at height zero. We prove that they are enumerated by so-called Q-bonacci numbers (recently introduced by Kirgizov) which generalize the classical q-bonacci numbers in the case where q is a positive rational.</description>

      <title>Uniform Sampling and Visualization of 3D Reluctant Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of walks confined to the first orthant whose defining stepset has drift outside of the region can be challenging to sample uniformly at random for large lengths. We address this by generalizing the 2D walk sampler of Lumbroso et al. to handle 3D walks restricted to the first orthant. The sampler includes a visualizer and means to animate the walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutations are usually enumerated by size, but new results can be found by enumerating them by inversions instead, in which case one must restrict one's attention to indecomposable permutations. In the style of the seminal paper by Simion and Schmidt, we investigate all combinations of permutation patterns of length at most 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show how to express the question of whether a polyform tiles the plane isohedrally as a Boolean formula that can be tested using a SAT solver.  This approach is adaptable to a wide range of polyforms, requires no special-case code for different isohedral tiling types, and integrates seamlessly with existing software for computing Heesch numbers of polyforms.</description>

Abstract: The partial sums of integer sequences that count the occurrences of a specific pattern in the binary expansion of positive integers have been investigated by different authors since the 1950s. In this note, we introduce generalized pattern sequences, which count the occurrences of a finite number of different patterns in the expansion of positive integers in any integer base, and analyze their partial sums.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore some generalizations of a counting problem related to tilings in grids of size 2xn, which was originally posed as a  question on Mathematics Stack Exchange (Question 3972905). In particular, we consider this problem for the product of two graphs G and  P(n), where P(n) is the path graph of n vertices. We  give explicit bivariate  generating functions for some specific cases.</description>

      <title>Natural Measures on Polyominoes Induced by the Abelian Sandpile Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a natural Boltzmann measure over polyominoes induced by boundary avalanches in the Abelian Sandpile Model. Through the study of a suitable associated process, we give an argument suggesting that the probability distribution of the avalnche sizes has a power-law decay with exponent 3/2, in contrast with the present understanding of bulk avalanches in the model (which has some exponent between 1 and 5/4), and to the ordinary generating function of polyominoes (which is conjectured to have a logarithmic singularity, i.e. exponent 1). We provide some numerical evidence for our claims, and evaluate some other statistical observables on our process, most notably the density of triple points.

      <title>Exponential Time Approximation for Coloring 3-Colorable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of efficiently coloring $3$-colorable graphs with few colors has received much attention on both the algorithmic and inapproximability fronts. We consider exponential time approximations, in which given a parameter $r$, we aim to develop an $r$-approximation algorithm with the best possible runtime, providing a tradeoff between runtime and approximation ratio. In this vein, an algorithm to $O(n^\varepsilon)$-color a 3-colorable graphs in time $2^{\Theta(n^{1-2\varepsilon}\log(n))}$ is given in (Atserias and Dalmau, SODA 2022.)
  We build on tools developed in (Bansal et al., Algorithmic, 2019) to obtain an algorithm to color $3$-colorable graphs with $O(r)$ colors in $\exp\left(\tilde{O}\left(\frac {n\log^{11/2}r} {r^3}\right)\right)$ time, asymptotically improving upon the bound given by Atserias and Dalmau.</description>

      <title>Graph polynomials: some questions on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We raise some questions about graph polynomials, highlighting concepts and phenomena that may merit consideration in the development of a general theory. Our questions are mainly of three types: When do graph polynomials have reduction relations (simple linear recursions based on local operations), perhaps in a wider class of combinatorial objects? How many levels of reduction relations does a graph polynomial need in order to express it in terms of trivial base cases? For a graph polynomial, how are properties such as equivalence and factorisation reflected in the structure of a graph? We illustrate our discussion with a variety of graph polynomials and other invariants. This leads us to reflect on the historical origins of graph polynomials. We also introduce some new polynomials based on partial colourings of graphs and establish some of their basic properties.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on Social Configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cooperative game theory, the social configurations of players are modeled by balanced collections. The Bondareva-Shapley theorem, perhaps the most fundamental theorem in cooperative game theory, characterizes the existence of solutions to the game that benefit everyone using balanced collections. Roughly speaking, if the trivial set system of all players is one of the most efficient balanced collections for the game, then the set of solutions from which each coalition benefits, the so-called core, is non-empty.
  In this paper, we discuss some interactions between combinatorics and cooperative game theory that are still relatively unexplored. Indeed, the similarity between balanced collections and uniform hypergraphs seems to be a relevant point of view to obtain new properties on those collections through the theory of combinatorial species.  </description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We computationally completely enumerate a number of types of row-column designs up to isotopism, including double, sesqui and triple arrays as known from the literature, and two newly introduced types that we call mono arrays and AO-arrays. We calculate autotopism group sizes for the designs we generate. For larger parameter values, where complete enumeration is not feasible, we generate examples of some of the designs, and generate exhaustive lists of admissible parameters. For some admissible parameter sets, we prove non-existence results. We also give some explicit constructions of sesqui arrays, mono arrays and AO-arrays, and investigate connections to Youden rectangles and binary pseud Youden designs.</description>

      <title>Delineating Half-Integrality of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa Property for Minors: the Case of Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1986 Robertson and Seymour proved a generalization of the seminal result of Erd\H{o}s and P\'osa on the duality of packing and covering cycles: A graph has the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors if and only if it is planar. In particular, for every non-planar graph $H$ they gave examples showing that the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property does not hold for $H.$ Recently, Liu confirmed a conjecture of Thomas and showed that every graph has the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors. Liu's proof is non-constructive and to this date, with the exception of a small number of examples, no constructive proof is known.
  In this paper, we initiate the delineation of the half-integrality of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors. We conjecture that for every graph $H,$ there exists a unique (up to a suitable equivalence relation) graph parameter ${\textsf{EP}}_H$ such that $H$ has the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property in a minor-closed graph class $\mathcal{G}$ if and only if $\sup\{\textsf{EP}_H(G) \mid G\in\mathcal{G}\}$ is finite. We prove this conjecture for the class $\mathcal{H}$ of Kuratowski-connected shallow-vortex minors by showing that, for every non-planar $H\in\mathcal{H},$ the parameter ${\sf EP}_H(G)$ is precisely the maximum order of a Robertson-Seymour counterexample to the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property of $H$ which can be found as a minor in $G.$ Our results are constructive and imply, for the first time, parameterized algorithms that find either a packing, or a cover, or one of the Robertson-Seymour counterexamples, certifying the existence of a half-integral packing for the graphs in $\mathcal{H}.$</description>

      <title>Permutation Codes Correcting Multiple Deletions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation codes in the Ulam metric, which can correct multiple deletions, have been investigated extensively recently owing to their applications. In this work, we are interested in the maximum size of the permutation codes in the Ulam metric and aim to design permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions with efficient decoding algorithms. We first present an improvement on the Gilbert--Varshamov bound of the maximum size of these permutation codes which is the best-known lower bound. Next, we focus on designing permutation codes in the Ulam metric with a decoding algorithm. These constructed codes are the best-known permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions. In particular, the constructed permutation codes can correct $t$ deletions with at most $(3t-1) \log n+o(\log n)$ bits of redundancy where $n$ is the length of the code. Finally, we provide an efficient decoding algorithm for our constructed permutation codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this expository paper we present some ideas of algebraic topology in a language accessible to non-specialists in the area. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. We start from the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all $1$-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of $1$-cycles in a given graph such that any $1$-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs, and to certain configuration spaces of graphs (namely, to the square and the deleted square).</description>

      <title>Smoothed Analysis of the Koml\'os Conjecture: Rademacher Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06285v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The {\em discrepancy} of a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is given by $\mathrm{DISC}(M) := \min_{\boldsymbol{x} \in \{-1,1\}^n} \|M\boldsymbol{x}\|_\infty$. An outstanding conjecture, attributed to Koml\'os, stipulates that $\mathrm{DISC}(M) = O(1)$, whenever $M$ is a Koml\'os matrix, that is, whenever every column of $M$ lies within the unit sphere. Our main result asserts that $\mathrm{DISC}(M + R/\sqrt{d}) = O(d^{-1/2})$ holds asymptotically almost surely, whenever $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is Koml\'os, $R \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is a Rademacher random matrix, $d = \omega(1)$, and $n = \omega(d \log d)$. The factor $d^{-1/2}$ normalising $R$ is essentially best possible and the dependency between $n$ and $d$ is asymptotically best possible. Our main source of inspiration is a result by Bansal, Jiang, Meka, Singla, and Sinha (ICALP 2022). They obtained an assertion similar to the one above in the case that the smoothing matrix is Gaussian. They asked whether their result can be attained with the optimal dependency $n = \omega(d \log d)$ in the case of Bernoulli random noise or any other types of discretely distributed noise; the latter types being more conducive for Smoothed Analysis in other discrepancy settings such as the Beck-Fiala problem. For Bernoulli noise, their method works if $n = \omega(d^2)$. In the case of Rademacher noise, we answer the question posed by Bansal, Jiang, Meka, Singla, and Sinha. Our proof builds upon their approach in a strong way and provides a discrete version of the latter. Breaking the $n = \omega(d^2)$ barrier and reaching the optimal dependency $n = \omega(d \log d)$ for Rademacher noise requires additional ideas expressed through a rather meticulous counting argument, incurred by the need to maintain a high level of precision all throughout the discretisation process.</description>

      <title>On degree-$3$ and $(n-4)$-correlation-immune perfect colorings of $n$-cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A perfect $k$-coloring of the Boolean hypercube $Q_n$ is a function from the set of binary words of length $n$ onto a $k$-set of colors such that for any colors $i$ and $j$ every word of color $i$ has exactly $S(i,j)$ neighbors (at Hamming distance $1$) of color $j$, where the coefficient $S(i,j)$ depends only on $i$ and $j$ but not on the particular choice of the word. The $k$-by-$k$ table of all coefficients $S(i,j)$ is called the quotient matrix. We characterize perfect colorings of $Q_n$ of degree at most $3$, that is, with quotient matrix whose all eigenvalues are not less than $n-6$, or, equivalently, such that every color corresponds to a Boolean function represented by a polynomial of degree at most $3$ over $R$. Additionally, we characterize $(n-4)$-correlation-immune perfect colorings of $Q_n$, whose all colors correspond to $(n-4)$-correlation-immune Boolean functions, or, equivalently, all non-main (different from $n$) eigenvalues of the quotient matrix are not greater than $6-n$.
  Keywords: perfect coloring, equitable partition, resilient function, correlation-immune function.</description>

      <title>Permutation Entropy for Signal Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shannon Entropy is the preeminent tool for measuring the level of uncertainty (and conversely, information content) in a random variable. In the field of communications, entropy can be used to express the information content of given signals (represented as time series) by considering random variables which sample from specified subsequences. In this paper, we will discuss how an entropy variant, the \textit{permutation entropy} can be used to study and classify radio frequency signals in a noisy environment. The permutation entropy is the entropy of the random variable which samples occurrences of permutation patterns from time series given a fixed window length, making it a function of the distribution of permutation patterns. Since the permutation entropy is a function of the relative order of data, it is (global) amplitude agnostic and thus allows for comparison between signals at different scales. This article is intended to describe a permutation patterns approach to a data driven problem in radio frequency communications research, and includes a primer on all non-permutation pattern specific background. An empirical analysis of the methods herein on radio frequency data is included. No prior knowledge of signals analysis is assumed, and permutation pattern specific notation will be included. This article serves as a self-contained introduction to the relationship between permutation patterns, entropy, and signals analysis for studying radio frequency signals and includes results on a classification task.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A word $w=w_1\cdots w_n$ over the set of positive integers is a Motzkin word whenever $w_1=\texttt{1}$, $1\leq w_k\leq w_{k-1}+1$, and $w_{k-1}\neq w_{k}$ for $k=2, \dots, n$. It can be associated to a $n$-column Motzkin polyomino whose $i$-th column contains $w_i$ cells, and all columns are bottom-justified. We reveal bijective connections between Motzkin paths, restricted Catalan words, primitive \L{}ukasiewicz paths, and Motzkin polyominoes. Using the aforementioned bijections together with classical one-to-one correspondence with Dyck paths avoiding $UDU$s, we provide generating functions with respect to the length, area, semiperimeter, value of the last symbol, and number of interior points of Motzkin polyominoes. We give asymptotics and closed-form expressions for the total area, total semiperimeter, sum of the last symbol values, and total number of interior points over all Motzkin polyominoes of a given length. We also present and prove an engaging trinomial relation concerning the number of cells lying at different levels and first terms of the expanded $(1+x+x^2)^n$.</description>

Abstract: We call progressive paths and rushed paths two families of Dyck paths studied by Asinowski and Jelinek, which have the same enumerating sequence (OEIS entry A287709). We present a bijection proving this fact. Rushed paths turn out to be in bijection with one-sided trees, introduced by Durhuus and Unel, which have an asymptotic enumeration involving a stretched exponential. We conclude by presenting several other classes of related lattice paths and directed animals that may have similar asymptotic properties.</description>
