      <title>Computational Modeling of Exciton-bath Hamiltonians for LH2 and LH3 Complexes of Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light harvesting 2 (LH2) complex is a primary component of the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria that is responsible for harvesting and relaying excitons. The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.</description>

      <title>Transient spark dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode for dye degradation: A primary study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential application of non-thermal plasma in treating textile industrial wastewater motivates researchers to develop innovative techniques at a laboratory scale to achieve the goal of wastewater mineralization. In line with this objective, a dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode has been built for the study of synthetic dye degradation. The plasma reactor was optimized by altering various operating conditions to achieve a higher degradation efficiency at given discharge conditions. The reaction kinetics of crystal violet degradation were studied, and the same plasma reactor was tested for other synthetic dyes (wastewater model samples). The results suggest that the proposed dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor may offer a promising solution for treating dye effluents from the textile industry.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Information-Driven Adaptive Acquisition for Photon-Efficient FLIM: A Dual-Implementation Framework for TCSPC and Programmable Time-Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Fisher-information (FI) framework for photon-efficient fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) that treats temporal sampling as a controllable design variable under a fixed photon (dose) budget. Starting from a Poisson photon-counting model for bi-exponential fluorescence decays convolved with a finite instrument response function (IRF) and including additive background, we derive FI for both time-binned TCSPC histograms and programmable time-gated acquisitions. To ensure robustness when nuisance parameters such as IRF width, temporal offset, and background level are uncertain, we compute an effective FI using a Schur-complement marginalization and select hardware-feasible temporal designs by maximizing D-optimal criteria over candidate libraries. Across instrument-agnostic simulations spanning IRF broadening and increasing background fractions, FI-driven temporal designs consistently improve photon efficiency relative to uniform sampling, while nuisance-aware planning yields more stable gains under mismatch than naive optimization. Monte Carlo studies with maximum-likelihood estimation confirm that higher effective FI translates into reduced estimator variance and improved parametric map quality at fixed photon budgets. Finally, we map the same FI core to two practical deployment pathways: adaptive re-binning for TCSPC FLIM and adaptive gate placement/width selection for time-gated FLIM, enabling information-theoretic acquisition without hardware modification.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.</description>

      <title>Effects of Donor-Acceptor Quantum Coherence and Non-Markovian Bath on the Distance Dependence of Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate information on the distance dependence of resonance energy transfer (RET) is crucial for its utilization as a spectroscopic ruler \re{of} nanometer scale distances. In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\"{o}rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Adaptive High-Level Tight Control of Prostate Cancer: A Path from From Terminal Disease to Chronic Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastatic prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is characterized by a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. In this work, we explore how a clinical oncologist can apply a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to prolong metastatic prostate cancer survival, or even make it chronic in duration. We utilize a Bayesian optimization approach to identify the optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) to maximize the time before the patient begins to show symptoms. We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in coupled viscoelastic media: A fractional Langevin equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion often arises in complex environments where viscoelastic or crowded conditions influence particle motion. In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\alpha&lt;\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\alpha=\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.</description>
