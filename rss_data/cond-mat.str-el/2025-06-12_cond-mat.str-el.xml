      <title>"Symmetry-from-Anomaly" in Condensed Matter related Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The noninvertible axial symmetry constructed from the ABJ-anomaly has attracted enormous interest. We discuss the mechanism of "symmetry-from-anomaly" in condensed matter-related models in both 1d and 3d spaces (which correspond to (1+1)d and (3+1)d space-time). Within the models discussed here, we establish the connection between field theory quantities such as different versions of the axial charge, and quantities with simple physical meanings in our systems. In our models and likely a class of related constructions, the existence of a topological order is necessary for the purpose of properly defining the axial symmetry. But the proper axial symmetry we define, though requires a topological order, is different from the noninvertible axial symmetry discussed in recent proposals.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of the Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid on a honeycomb lattice is an intriguing many-body state characterized by its topological order and massive entanglement. One of the significant issues is to prepare and manipulate the ground state as well as excited states in a quantum simulator. Here, we provide a protocol to manipulate the Kitaev quantum spin liquid via digital quantum simulation. A series of unitary gates for the protocol is explicitly constructed, showing its circuit depth is an order of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ with the number of qubits, N. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol on the IBM Heron r2 processor for N = 8 and 12. We further validate our theoretical framework through numerical simulations, confirming high-fidelity quantum state control for system sizes up to N = 450, and discuss the possible implications of these results.</description>

      <title>(2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</description>

      <title>Putative excitonic insulating state in narrow-gap semiconductor La$_3$Cd$_2$As$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic insulators are electronically-driven phases of matter characterized by the spontaneous condensation of electron-hole pairs. Here we show that La$_3$Cd$_2$As$_6$ undergoes a transition at $T_{0}=278$ K to a highly insulating state with no accompanying structural transition. We observe quasi-two-dimensional electrical transport and charge fluctuations consistent with an electronic transition enabled by enhanced Coulomb interactions. Density functional theory calculations are unable to replicate the insulating ground state. Our results support the opening of a gap by excitonic effects at $T_{0}$, placing La$_3$Cd$_2$As$_6$ as a rare example of a bulk excitonic insulator.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice entanglement in $\mathbf{CoPS}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is an overview of some recent work done on the double perovskites. We discuss the physics of selected double perovskite compounds emphasizing the relevant interactions and resulting observable phenomena such as the magnetic order using different theoretical approaches. Spin-Orbit interaction, which is comparable to other relevant interaction strengths, plays a central role in determining the physics of such 4d-5d perovskites.</description>

It examines fundamental quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Annealing (QA), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as applied to key condensed matter problems including strongly correlated systems, topological phases, and quantum magnetism. This review details leading software development kits (SDKs) like Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, and Q\#, and profiles key academic, commercial, and governmental initiatives driving innovation in this domain. Furthermore, it assesses current challenges, including hardware limitations, algorithmic scalability, and error mitigation, and explores future trajectories, anticipating new algorithmic breakthroughs, software enhancements, and the impact of next-generation quantum hardware. The central theme emphasizes the critical role of a co-design approach, where algorithms, software, and hardware evolve in tandem, and highlights the necessity of standardized benchmarks to accelerate progress towards leveraging quantum computation for transformative discoveries in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Resonant Spectroscopy Simulations Using Multi-Shifted Bi-Conjugate Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant spectroscopies, which involve intermediate states with finite lifetimes, provide essential insights into collective excitations in quantum materials that are otherwise inaccessible. However, theoretical understanding in this area is often limited by the numerical challenges of solving Kramers-Heisenberg-type response functions for large-scale systems. To address this, we introduce a multi-shifted biconjugate gradient algorithm that exploits the shared structure of Krylov subspaces across spectra with varying incident energies, effectively reducing the computational complexity to that of linear spectroscopies. Both mathematical proofs and numerical benchmarks confirm that this algorithm substantially accelerates spectral simulations, achieving constant complexity independent of the number of incident energies, while ensuring accuracy and stability. This development provides a scalable, versatile framework for simulating advanced spectroscopies in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative theory of magnetic properties of elemental praseodymium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elemental Pr metal crystallizes in the double hexagonal close packed (dhcp) structure and is unique among rare-earth elements in featuring a localized partially filled 4f shell without ordered magnetism. Experimental evidence attributes this absence of magnetism to a singlet crystal-field (CF) ground state of the Pr 4f$^2$ configuration, which is energetically well isolated from excited magnetic doublets. Here, we construct a realistic effective magnetic Hamiltonian for dhcp Pr, by combining density-functional theory with dynamical mean-field theory, in the quasiatomic Hubbard-I approximation. Our calculations fully determine the CF potential and predict singlet CF ground states at both inequivalent sites of the dhcp lattice. The intersite exchange interactions, obtained from the magnetic force theorem, are found to be insufficient to close the CF gap to the magnetic doublets. Hence, ab-initio theory is demonstrated to explain the unusual, non-magnetic state of elemental Pr. Extending this analysis to the (0001) surface of Pr, we find that the singlet ground state remains robust preventing conventional magnetic orders. Nevertheless, the gap between the ground state and the lowest excited singlet is significantly reduced at the surface, opening the possibility for exotic two-dimensional multipolar orders to emerge within this two-singlet manifold.</description>

      <title>Accelerating ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations by delayed update and block force-bias update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) methods have become key numerical tools for studying quantum phases and phase transitions in interacting many-fermion systems. Despite the broad applicability, the efficiency of these algorithms is often limited by the bottleneck associated with the {\it local update} of the field configuration. In this work, we propose two novel update schemes, the {\it delayed update} and {\it block force-bias update}, both of which can generally and efficiently accelerate ground-state AFQMC simulations. The {\it delayed update}, with a predetermined delay rank, is an elegantly improved version of the {\it local update}, accelerating the process by replacing multiple vector-vector outer products in the latter with a single matrix-matrix multiplication. The {\it block force-bias update} is a block variant of the conventional force-bias update, which is a highly efficient scheme for dilute systems but suffers from the low acceptance ratio in lattice models. Our modified scheme maintains the high efficiency while offering flexible tuning of the acceptance ratio, controlled by the block size, for any desired fermion filling. We apply these two update schemes to both the standard and spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional Hubbard models, demonstrating their speedup over the {\it local update} with respect to the delay rank and block size. We also explore their efficiencies across varying system sizes and model parameters. Our results identify a speedup of $\sim$$8$ for systems with $\sim$$1600$ lattice sites. Furthermore, we have investigated the broader applications as well as an application diagram of these update schemes to general correlated fermion systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems typically requires knowledge of the reduced density matrix. Here, we apply the parquet dynamical vertex approximation to study the two-site reduced density matrix at varying distance, in the Hubbard model at weak coupling. This allows us to investigate the spatial structure of entanglement in dependence of interaction strength, electron filling, and temperature. We compare results from different entanglement measures, and benchmark against quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and effective masses of IrO$_2$ probed by de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iridium-containing conducting materials are widely investigated for their strong spin-orbit coupling and potential topological properties. Recently the commonly used electrode material iridium dioxide was found to host a large spin-Hall conductivity and was shown to support Dirac nodal lines. Here we present quantum-oscillation experiments on high-quality IrO$_2$ single crystals using the de Haas-van Alphen effect measured using torque magnetometry with a piezo-resistive microcantilever as well as density functional theory-based band-structure calculations. The angle, temperature and field dependencies of the oscillations and the calculated band dispersion provide valuable information on the properties of the charge carriers, including the Fermi-surface geometry and electronic correlations. Comparison of experimental results to calculations allows us to assigns the observed de Haas-van Alphen frequencies to the calculated Fermi surface topology. We find that the effective masses of IrO$_2$ are enhanced compared to the rest electron mass $m_e$, ranging from 1.9 to 3.0~$m_e$, whereas the scattering times indicate excellent sample quality. We discuss our results in context with recent ARPES and band-structure calculation results that found Dirac nodal lines in IrO$_2$ and compare the effective masses and other electronic properties to those of similar materials like the nodal chain metal ReO$_2$ in which Dirac electrons with very light effective masses have been observed.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of static and dynamic local magnetic fields in an S = 3/2 honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Co2Te3O8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional honeycomb lattices, characterized by their low coordination numbers, provide a fertile platform for exploring various quantum phenomena due to the intricate interplay between competing magnetic interactions, spin-orbit coupling, and crystal electric fields. Beyond the widely studied Jeff= 1/2 honeycomb systems, S = 3/2 honeycomb lattices present a promising alternative route to realizing the classical spin liquid-like state within the spin-S Kitaev models. Herein, we present crystal structure, thermodynamic, neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation (muSR) measurements, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on an unexplored 3d transition metal based compound Co2Te3O8, where Co2+ (S = 3/2) ions form a distorted honeycomb lattice in the crystallographic bc-plane without any anti-side disorder between constituent atoms. A clear lambda type anomaly around 55 K in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data indicates the onset of a long-range ordered state below TN= 55 K. The dominant antiferromagnetic interaction between S = 3/2 moments is evidenced by a relatively large negative Curie-Weiss temperature of -103 K derived from magnetic susceptibility data and supported by DFT calculations. The signature of long-range antiferomagnetic order state in the thermodynamic data is corroborated by neutron diffraction and muSR results. Furthermore, muSR experiments reveal the coexistence of static and dynamic local magnetic fields below TN, along with a complex magnetic structure that can be associated with XY-like antiferromagnet, as confirmed by neutron diffraction experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations and exchange parameters of a nickel chain compound PbMn$_2$Ni$_6$Te$_3$O$_{18}$: Neutron scattering and density functional theory studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the quasi-one dimensional Ni-chain compound PbMn$_2$Ni$_6$Te$_2$O$_{18}$ using theoretical DFT calculations, inelastic neutron scattering and optical spectroscopy in order to understand the nature of magnetic exchange interactions. Our inelastic neutron scattering study at 5 K on a powder sample reveals two bands of magnetic excitations, the first near 8 meV and the second near 18 meV originating from the antiferromagnetic zone center near $Q$ = 1~\AA. On the other hand at 100 K (which is above T$_N$ = 86 K) a broad diffuse scattering signal is observed indicating the presence of short range magnetic correlations. We have analyzed the magnetic excitations based on the Linear Spin Wave Theory (LSWT) and compared the experimentally estimated exchange parameters with the DFT calculations. Our analysis reveals that the value of the exchange parameter at the larger distance (d=3.654 $\AA$) $J_3$=4.21(8) meV between Ni-Ni (from inter-chain) is the strongest amongst the allowed six exchange parameters, which suggests that this system is not really a quasi-one-dimensional and confirmed by the absence of a Haldane gap. We have also presented the electronic structure calculations. The spin-polarized partial density of states (DOS) projected onto the Mn-d and Ni-d orbitals reveals that the Ni-d$_{x^2-y^2}$ contribution is dominant below the Fermi level in the spin-up and spin-down channel, while a minimal contribution from spin-up Mn states in the occupied region, suggesting a nearly high-spin state. The estimated N\'eel temperature, based on experimental exchange parameters is found to be in close agreement with the experimental value.</description>

      <title>Unusual electron correlations in Kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A= K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of electronic order-quantum phase interplay in Kagome lattices commonly employs the extended Kagome-Hubbard model, where the critical parameters comprise on-site $(U)$ and intersite $(V)$ Coulomb interactions. In prototypical kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), the geometrically frustrated quasi-2D architecture induces pressure-dependent complexity in vanadium d-electron correlations, necessitating systematic theoretical scrutiny. Utilizing the $d-dp$ model within constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we quantified $U$, $V$, and Hund's coupling $J$ under hydrostatic pressure (0-9 GPa). While $KV_3Sb_5$ and $RbV_3Sb_5$ exhibit pressure-insensitive interaction parameters, $CsV_3Sb_5$ manifests anomalous discontinuities in $U$ and $V$ near $0.2$ GPa, suggesting a first-order electronic phase transition. This work establishes cRPA-derived interaction landscapes as critical predictors for pressure-tunable quantum phenomena in correlated kagome systems, offers a new insight into the understanding of the interplay between the CDW transition and the double superconductivity dome in $CsV_3Sb_5$ at low pressure.</description>

      <title>Microscopic investigation of enhanced Pauli paramagnetism in metallic Pu$_2$C$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combined study of the structural and electronic properties of polycrystalline Pu$_2$C$_3$ is reported based on x-ray diffraction, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, ${}^{13}$C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and band structure calculations. X-ray diffraction reveals a global noncentrosymmetric cubic lattice, with a nearest-neighbor C--C bond length of $r = 1.38$ \r{A}. ${}^{13}$C NMR measurements indicate that the global cubic symmetry is locally broken, revealing two unique carbon environments. Magnetic susceptibility suggests enhanced Pauli paramagnetism, and specific heat reveals a moderately large electronic Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma = 45$ mJ mol$_{\mathrm{Pu}}^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$, with a Wilson ratio $R_W \approx 1.3$ further indicating moderate correlations. ${}^{13}$C nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) and Knight shift ($K$) measurements find metallic Korringa behavior (i.e., $T_1TK^2=$ const.) with modest ferromagnetic spin fluctuations at low temperature. Taken together, the data point to a delocalized nature of a narrow 5$f$-electron band with weak electronic correlations. Density functional theory band-structure calculations confirm the appearance of such narrow 5$f$ bands near the Fermi level. Our data provide prime evidence for a plutonium-based metallic system with weak electronic correlations, which sheds new light on the understanding of complex paramagnetism in actinide-based metallic compounds.</description>

      <title>Hidden degree of freedom implied by unusual nonlocal transport in a topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects have established a principle to understand nonlocal charge transport due to an additional degree of freedom. This principle applies successfully to the nonlocal transport due to the valley degree of freedom in graphene or to the chiral degree of freedom in a Weyl semimetal. Here we report the discovery of an unusual nonlocal charge transport that cannot be explained by any known mechanism and hence points to the existence of a hidden degree of freedom. This phenomenon was found in ZrTe$_5$ in the nodal-line semimetal phase and it occurs in the ultraquantun limit driven by the magnetic field applied along the $a$-axis. Surprisingly, the decay length of the nonlocality increases linearly with the sample width and exceeds 100 $\mu$m, suggesting that the relevant degree of freedom experiences little scattering. This nonlocal transport shows up not only as a longitudinal voltage gradient, but also as an unusual nonlocal Hall effect. Such an exotic phenomenon in a topological material is unprecedented and implies new physics.</description>

      <title>Generic Chiral Anomaly and Planar Hall Effect in a Non-Weyl System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The condensed-matter version of the chiral anomaly describes how electrons are pumped from a Weyl node with negative chirality to a Weyl node with positive chirality using parallel electric and magnetic fields. Key experimental signatures are a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE), both of which have been experimentally observed. Here, we show that the chiral anomaly explains key features of magnetotransport in the nodal-line semimetal ZrTe$_5$ despite the absence of Weyl points. The anomaly physics applies generically to materials in the quantum limit, when electron transport becomes quasi-one-dimensional, provided that Fermi velocities remain sufficiently large. This explains not only the negative LMR but also the PHE with a gigantic Hall angle and a highly unusual magnetic-field-angle dependence in ZrTe$_5$.</description>

      <title>Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Bose liquid from anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of bad metal beta-Ta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of beta-tantalum, a ``bad" metal whose electronic properties are inconsistent with the Fermi liquid theory. Fano factors cluster around even multiples of the values expected for Fermi liquids, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated charge liquid of Cooper pair-like electron groups. Further evidence for correlations is provided by the effects of magnetic impurities, as well as reduced density of states near the Fermi level indicated by point contact spectroscopy and first principles calculations. Our results open new avenues for studies and applications of electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Kinetic Ferromagnetism in the Square Lattice Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the exact phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model remains poorly understood despite decades of progress, nearly 60 years ago, Nagaoka proved that a single dopant in an otherwise half-filled Hubbard system can bring about ferromagnetism through kinetic means. The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Anyon delocalization transitions out of a disordered FQAH insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, we develop a theory of doping-induced transitions out of the $\nu = 2/3$ lattice Jain state in the presence of quenched disorder. We show that disorder strongly affects the evolution into the conducting phases described in our previous work. The delocalization of charge $2/3$ anyons leads to a chiral topological superconductor through a direct second order transition for a smooth random potential with long-wavelength modulations. The longitudinal resistance has a universal peak at the associated quantum critical point. Close to the transition, we show that the superconducting ground state is an ``Anomalous Vortex Glass (AVG)'' stabilized in the absence of an external magnetic field. For short-wavelength disorder, this transition generically splits into three distinct ones with intermediate insulating topological phases. If instead, the charge $1/3$ anyon delocalizes, then at low doping the result is a Reentrant Integer Quantum Hall state with $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2$. At higher doping this undergoes a second transition to a Fermi liquid metal. We show that this framework provides a plausible explanation for the complex phase diagram recently observed in twisted MoTe$_2$ near $\nu = 2/3$ and discuss future experiments that can test our theory in more detail.</description>

      <title>Bound States at Semiconductor -- Mott Insulator Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the hierarchy of correlations in the context of a Fermi-Hubbard model, we deduce the presence of quasi-particle bound states at the interface between a Mott insulator and a semiconductor, as well as within a semiconductor-Mott-semiconductor heterostructure forming a quantum well. In the case of the solitary interface, the existence of bound states necessitates the presence of an additional perturbation with a minimal strength depending on the spin background of the Mott insulator. Conversely, within the quantum well, this additional perturbation is still required to have bound states while standing-wave solutions even exist in its absence.</description>

      <title>Hall Angle of a Spatially Random Vector Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strange metals exhibit linear resistivity and anomalous Hall transport, yet a comprehensive theory that accounts for both phenomena is still lacking. Recent studies have shown SYK-like spatially random couplings between a Fermi surface and a bosonic field, either scalar or vector type, can yield linear-$T$ resistivity. In this paper, we continue the investigation on a vector coupling in the presence of a magnetic field. We compute the fermion and boson propagators, along with the self-energy and polarization functions, and determine their dependence on the magnetic field. Although the Hall angle does not exhibit the signature of strange-metal, the linear-in-temperature resistivity remains at low temperatures. Results indicate that random interactions can robustly support linear transport, though additional ingredients may be required to capture the full phenomenology of strange metals.</description>
