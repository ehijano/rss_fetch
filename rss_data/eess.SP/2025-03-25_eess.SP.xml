      <title>Learning Beamforming Codebooks for Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of beamforming codebooks for the base station (BS) and for the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an active sensing scheme for uplink localization, in which the mobile user transmits a sequence of pilots to the BS through reflection at the RISs, and the BS and the RISs are adaptively configured by carefully choosing BS beamforming codeword and RIS codewords from their respective codebooks in a sequential manner to progressively focus onto the user. Most existing codebook designs for RIS are not tailored for active sensing, by which we mean the choice of the next codeword should depend on the measurements made so far, and the sequence of codewords should dynamically focus reflection toward the user. Moreover, most existing codeword selection methods rely on exhaustive search in beam training to identify the codeword with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus incurring substantial pilot overhead as the size of the codebook scales. This paper proposes learning-based approaches for codebook construction and for codeword selection for active sensing. The proposed learning approach aims to locate a target in the service area by recursively selecting a sequence of BS beamforming codewords and RIS codewords from the respective codebooks as more measurements become available without exhaustive beam training. The codebook design and the codeword selection fuse key ideas from the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn respectively the discrete function space of the codebook and the temporal dependencies between measurements.</description>

      <title>Joint Sparse Graph for Enhanced MIMO-AFDM Receiver Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising chirp-assisted multicarrier waveform for future high-mobility communications. This paper is devoted to enhanced receiver design for multiple input and multiple output AFDM (MIMO-AFDM) systems. Firstly, we introduce a unified variational inference (VI) approach to approximate the target posterior distribution, under which the belief propagation (BP) and expectation propagation (EP)-based algorithms are derived. As both VI-based detection and low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding can be expressed by bipartite graphs in MIMO-AFDM systems, we construct a joint sparse graph (JSG) by merging the graphs of these two for low-complexity receiver design. Then, based on this graph model, we present the detailed message propagation of the proposed JSG. Additionally, we propose an enhanced JSG (E-JSG) receiver based on the linear constellation encoding model. The proposed E-JSG eliminates the need for interleavers, de-interleavers, and log-likelihood ratio transformations, thus leading to concurrent detection and decoding over the integrated sparse graph. To further reduce detection complexity, we introduce a sparse channel method by approaximating multiple graph edges with insignificant channel coefficients into a single edge on the VI graph. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed receivers in terms of computational complexity, detection and decoding latency, and error rate performance compared to the conventional ones.</description>

      <title>Parameter Design for Secure Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secure affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform design is a main concern in high-mobility networks. In this article, we employ the four key parameters in AFDM to design secure waveforms, and afterward we analyze the role of the four parameters to reveal the design guideline. We find that c1 is bounded by the Doppler shifts and preset guard. The parameter c2 exhibits a minimum periodicity of 1, with the effective range [0, 1] rather than any real number. The adjustable parameters c1 and c2 introduce additional degrees of freedom to the AFDM waveform, thereby enhancing the anti-eavesdropping performance. In addition, excessive Lmax that determines the preset guard interval leads to a security-risk interval and poses eavesdropping risks. Therefore, the optimal Lmax equals maximum delay. Numerical simulations verify the accuracy of our analysis.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Passive Localization (RAPL): An Efficient Zero-Overhead Framework Using Conditional Sample Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising solution for enhancing localization accuracy. Traditional RIS-based localization methods typically rely on prior channel knowledge, beam scanning, and pilot-based assistance. These approaches often result in substantial energy and computational overhead, and require real-time coordination between the base station (BS) and the RIS. To address these challenges, in this work, we move beyond conventional methods and introduce a novel data-driven, multiple RISs-assisted passive localization approach (RAPL). The proposed method includes two stages, the angle-of-directions (AoDs) between the RISs and the user is estimated by using the conditional sample mean in the first stage, and then the user's position is determined based on the estimated multiple AoD pairs in the second stage. This approach only utilizes the existing communication signals between the user and the BS, relying solely on the measurement of received signal power at each BS antenna for a set of randomly generated phase shifts across all RISs. Moreover, by obviating the need for real-time RIS phase shift optimization or user-to-BS pilot transmissions, the method introduces no additional communication overhead, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-world networks. The proposed scheme is then extended to multi-RIS scenarios considering both parallel and cascaded RIS topologies. Numerical results show that the proposed RAPL improves localization accuracy while significantly reducing energy and signaling overhead compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Iterative Decoder of Channel-polarized Multilevel Coding for Data Center Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data center networks (DCNs) require a low-cost, low-power optical transceiver to handle increased traffic from generative artificial intelligence, video streaming services, and more. Improving the required signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) by digital signal processing such as forward error correction (FEC) mitigates the requirements for electrical and optical components. The optical transceivers in DCNs exploit a low-complexity soft-decision (SD) FEC, consisting of short block-length linear error-correcting codes and a low-complexity SD decoder (SDD), such as a Chase decoder and ordered statistical decoding. The low complexity SDD efficiently approaches a maximum likelihood decoding (MLD). However, the decoding performance of MLD is limited by its finite block length. In this paper, we describe the detail of our proposed channel-polarized multilevel coding with iterative decoding (CP-MLC-ID), which improves the decoding performance. The 19.5$\%$-OH CP-MLC-ID 128-bit extended Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (eBCH) and KP4 codes outperform the concatenated eBCH and KP4 codes with a net coding gain of 0.25 and 0.40 dB for the same and double the number of SDDs, respectively. We also investigate the dependency of the decoding performance on the size of a bit interleaver. The performance degradation of CP-MLC-ID using an 8-bit interleaver is about 0.1 dB compared to using the large-bit interleaver. Our results indicate that even a weak connection by exclusive-OR between codewords improves the decoding performance, compared to simple concatenated codes in the DCNs.</description>

      <title>Recover from Horcrux: A Spectrogram Augmentation Method for Cardiac Feature Monitoring from Radar Signal Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based wellness monitoring is becoming an effective measurement to provide accurate vital signs in a contactless manner, but data scarcity retards the related research on deep-learning-based methods. Data augmentation is commonly used to enrich the dataset by modifying the existing data, but most augmentation techniques can only couple with classification tasks. To enable the augmentation for regression tasks, this research proposes a spectrogram augmentation method, Horcrux, for radar-based cardiac feature monitoring (e.g., heartbeat detection, electrocardiogram reconstruction) with both classification and regression tasks involved. The proposed method is designed to increase the diversity of input samples while the augmented spectrogram is still faithful to the original ground truth vital sign. In addition, Horcrux proposes to inject zero values in specific areas to enhance the awareness of the deep learning model on subtle cardiac features, improving the performance for the limited dataset. Experimental result shows that Horcrux achieves an overall improvement of 16.20% in cardiac monitoring and has the potential to be extended to other spectrogram-based tasks. The code will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of EEG-based Machine Intelligence Algorithms for Depression Diagnosis, and Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression disorder is a serious health condition that has affected the lives of millions of people around the world. Diagnosis of depression is a challenging practice that relies heavily on subjective studies and, in most cases, suffers from late findings. Electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers have been suggested and investigated in recent years as a potential transformative objective practice. In this article, for the first time, a detailed systematic review of EEG-based depression diagnosis approaches is conducted using advanced machine learning techniques and statistical analyses. For this, 938 potentially relevant articles (since 1985) were initially detected and filtered into 139 relevant articles based on the review scheme 'preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA).' This article compares and discusses the selected articles and categorizes them according to the type of machine learning techniques and statistical analyses. Algorithms, preprocessing techniques, extracted features, and data acquisition systems are discussed and summarized. This review paper explains the existing challenges of the current algorithms and sheds light on the future direction of the field. This systematic review outlines the issues and challenges in machine intelligence for the diagnosis of EEG depression that can be addressed in future studies and possibly in future wearable technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing V2X Communications with UAV-mounted Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the crucial need for reliable wireless communication in vehicular networks, particularly vital for the safety and efficacy of (semi-)autonomous driving amid increasing traffic. We explore the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISes) mounted on Drone Relay Stations (DRS) to enhance communication reliability. Our study formulates an optimization problem to pinpoint the optimal location and orientation of the DRS, thereby creating an additional propagation path for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. We introduce a heuristic approach that combines trajectory optimization for DRS positioning and a Q-learning scheme for RIS orientation. Our results not only confirm the convergence of the Q-learning algorithm but also demonstrate significant communication improvements achieved by integrating a DRS into V2X networks.</description>

      <title>Rank-Based Modeling for Universal Packets Compression in Multi-Modal Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid increase in networked systems and data transmission requires advanced data compression solutions to optimize bandwidth utilization and enhance network performance. This study introduces a novel byte-level predictive model using Transformer architecture, capable of handling the redundancy and diversity of data types in network traffic as byte sequences. Unlike traditional methods that require separate compressors for different data types, this unified approach sets new benchmarks and simplifies predictive modeling across various data modalities such as video, audio, images, and text, by processing them at the byte level. This is achieved by predicting subsequent byte probability distributions, encoding them into a sparse rank sequence using lossless entropy coding, and significantly reducing both data size and entropy. Experimental results show that our model achieves compression ratios below 50%, while offering models of various sizes tailored for different communication devices. Additionally, we successfully deploy these models on a range of edge devices and servers, demonstrating their practical applicability and effectiveness in real-world network scenarios. This approach significantly enhances data throughput and reduces bandwidth demands, making it particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Angular-Based Hybrid Beamforming for Wideband THz Massive MIMO Systems: Mitigating Beam Split by Leveraging Angular Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam split is a critical challenge in wideband THz massive MIMO systems, arising from frequency-dependent beam misalignment that degrades communication performance, particularly in scenarios with narrow beamwidths and large arrays. This work proposes an angular-based hybrid beamforming framework that leverages angular spread to mitigate the beam split effect. Instead of relying on precise angular spread modeling, we utilize coarse angular information to guide the design of subcarrier-specific beams, effectively reducing misalignment across subcarriers. By broadening the effective beamwidth through angular spread, the proposed method enhances user coverage and alleviates beam split without requiring complex time-delay units or hardware-intensive solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in spectral efficiency and beamforming accuracy while maintaining low computational and hardware complexity. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for addressing beam split in next-generation wideband THz communication systems.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Task Offloading for Low-Latency and Reliable Task Completion in 5G MEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for MEC has increased with the rise of data-intensive applications and 5G networks, while conventional cloud models struggle to satisfy low-latency requirements. While task offloading is crucial for minimizing latency on resource-constrained User Equipment (UE), fully offloading of all tasks to MEC servers may result in overload and possible task drops. Overlooking the effect of number of dropped tasks can significantly undermine system efficiency, as each dropped task results in unfulfilled service demands and reduced reliability, directly impacting user experience and overall network performance. In this paper, we employ task partitioning, enabling partitions of task to be processed locally while assigning the rest to MEC, thus balancing the load and ensuring no task drops. This methodology enhances efficiency via Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Cuckoo Search, resulting in effective task assignment and minimum latency. Moreover, we ensure each user's RB allocation stays within the maximum limit while keeping latency low. Experimental results indicate that this strategy surpasses both full offloading and full local processing, providing significant improvements in latency and task completion rates across diverse number of users. In our scenario, MILP task partitioning results in 24% reduction in latency compared to MILP task offloading for the maximum number of users, whereas Cuckoo search task partitioning yields 18% latency reduction in comparison with Cuckoo search task offloading.</description>

      <title>Exploring Textual Semantics Diversity for Image Transmission in Semantic Communication Systems using Visual Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of machine learning has brought reforms and challenges to traditional communication systems. Semantic communication has appeared as an effective strategy to effectively extract relevant semantic signals semantic segmentation labels and image features for image transmission. However, the insufficient number of extracted semantic features of images will potentially result in a low reconstruction accuracy, which hinders the practical applications and still remains challenging for solving. In order to fill this gap, this letter proposes a multi-text transmission semantic communication (Multi-SC) system, which uses the visual language model (VLM) to assist in the transmission of image semantic signals. Unlike previous image transmission semantic communication systems, the proposed system divides the image into multiple blocks and extracts multiple text information from the image using a modified large language and visual assistant (LLaVA), and combines semantic segmentation tags with semantic text for image recovery. Simulation results show that the proposed text semantics diversity scheme can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy compared with related works.</description>

      <title>Noise Resilient Over-The-Air Federated Learning In Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven applications demand the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) to enable efficient and privacy-preserving model training across distributed devices. Over-The-Air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) exploits the superposition property of multiple access channels, allowing edge users in 6G networks to efficiently share spectral resources and perform low-latency global model aggregation. However, these advantages come with challenges, as traditional OTA-FL techniques suffer due to the joint effects of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at the server, fading, and both data and system heterogeneity at the participating edge devices. In this work, we propose the novel Noise Resilient Over-the-Air Federated Learning (NoROTA-FL) framework to jointly tackle these challenges in federated wireless networks. In NoROTA-FL, the local optimization problems find controlled inexact solutions, which manifests as an additional proximal constraint at the clients. This approach provides robustness against straggler-induced partial work, heterogeneity, noise, and fading. From a theoretical perspective, we leverage the zeroth- and first-order inexactness and establish convergence guarantees for non-convex optimization problems in the presence of heterogeneous data and varying system capabilities. Experimentally, we validate NoROTA-FL on real-world datasets, including FEMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating its robustness in noisy and heterogeneous environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as COTAF and FedProx, NoROTA-FL achieves significantly more stable convergence and higher accuracy, particularly in the presence of stragglers.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled their widespread deployment in critical applications such as emergency management. This paper investigates the challenge of efficient multitask multimodal data communication in UAV-assisted ISAC systems, in the considered system model, hyperspectral (HSI) and LiDAR data are collected by UAV-mounted sensors for both target classification and data reconstruction at the terrestrial BS. The limited channel capacity and complex environmental conditions pose significant challenges to effective air-to-ground communication. To tackle this issue, we propose a perception-enhanced multitask multimodal semantic communication (PE-MMSC) system that strategically leverages the onboard computational and sensing capabilities of UAVs. In particular, we first propose a robust multimodal feature fusion method that adaptively combines HSI and LiDAR semantics while considering channel noise and task requirements. Then the method introduces a perception-enhanced (PE) module incorporating attention mechanisms to perform coarse classification on UAV side, thereby optimizing the attention-based multimodal fusion and transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PE-MMSC system achieves 5\%--10\% higher target classification accuracy compared to conventional systems without PE module, while maintaining comparable data reconstruction quality with acceptable computational overheads.</description>

      <title>QINCODEC: Neural Audio Compression with Implicit Neural Codebooks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs, neural networks which compress a waveform into discrete tokens, play a crucial role in the recent development of audio generative models. State-of-the-art codecs rely on the end-to-end training of an autoencoder and a quantization bottleneck. However, this approach restricts the choice of the quantization methods as it requires to define how gradients propagate through the quantizer and how to update the quantization parameters online. In this work, we revisit the common practice of joint training and propose to quantize the latent representations of a pre-trained autoencoder offline, followed by an optional finetuning of the decoder to mitigate degradation from quantization. This strategy allows to consider any off-the-shelf quantizer, especially state-of-the-art trainable quantizers with implicit neural codebooks such as QINCO2. We demonstrate that with the latter, our proposed codec termed QINCODEC, is competitive with baseline codecs while being notably simpler to train. Finally, our approach provides a general framework that amortizes the cost of autoencoder pretraining, and enables more flexible codec design.</description>

      <title>Analyzable Chain-of-Musical-Thought Prompting for High-Fidelity Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-fidelity music. However, the conventional next-token prediction paradigm in AR models does not align with the human creative process in music composition, potentially compromising the musicality of generated samples. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MusiCoT, a novel chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique tailored for music generation. MusiCoT empowers the AR model to first outline an overall music structure before generating audio tokens, thereby enhancing the coherence and creativity of the resulting compositions. By leveraging the contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) model, we establish a chain of "musical thoughts", making MusiCoT scalable and independent of human-labeled data, in contrast to conventional CoT methods. Moreover, MusiCoT allows for in-depth analysis of music structure, such as instrumental arrangements, and supports music referencing -- accepting variable-length audio inputs as optional style references. This innovative approach effectively addresses copying issues, positioning MusiCoT as a vital practical method for music prompting. Our experimental results indicate that MusiCoT consistently achieves superior performance across both objective and subjective metrics, producing music quality that rivals state-of-the-art generation models.

      <title>An Overview of Low-Rank Structures in the Training and Adaptation of Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of deep learning has revolutionized data processing and prediction in signal processing and machine learning, yet the substantial computational demands of training and deploying modern large-scale deep models present significant challenges, including high computational costs and energy consumption. Recent research has uncovered a widespread phenomenon in deep networks: the emergence of low-rank structures in weight matrices and learned representations during training. These implicit low-dimensional patterns provide valuable insights for improving the efficiency of training and fine-tuning large-scale models. Practical techniques inspired by this phenomenon, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and training, enable significant reductions in computational cost while preserving model performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in exploiting low-rank structures for deep learning and shed light on their mathematical foundations. Mathematically, we present two complementary perspectives on understanding the low-rankness in deep networks: (i) the emergence of low-rank structures throughout the whole optimization dynamics of gradient and (ii) the implicit regularization effects that induce such low-rank structures at convergence. From a practical standpoint, studying the low-rank learning dynamics of gradient descent offers a mathematical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of LoRA in fine-tuning large-scale models and inspires parameter-efficient low-rank training strategies. Furthermore, the implicit low-rank regularization effect helps explain the success of various masked training approaches in deep neural networks, ranging from dropout to masked self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Geometric Meta-Learning via Coupled Ricci Flow: Unifying Knowledge Representation and Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a unified framework integrating geometric flows with deep learning through three fundamental innovations. First, we propose a thermodynamically coupled Ricci flow that dynamically adapts parameter space geometry to loss landscape topology, formally proved to preserve isometric knowledge embedding (Theorem~\ref{thm:isometric}). Second, we derive explicit phase transition thresholds and critical learning rates (Theorem~\ref{thm:critical}) through curvature blowup analysis, enabling automated singularity resolution via geometric surgery (Lemma~\ref{lem:surgery}). Third, we establish an AdS/CFT-type holographic duality (Theorem~\ref{thm:ads}) between neural networks and conformal field theories, providing entanglement entropy bounds for regularization design. Experiments demonstrate 2.1$\times$ convergence acceleration and 63\% topological simplification while maintaining $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ complexity, outperforming Riemannian baselines by 15.2\% in few-shot accuracy. Theoretically, we prove exponential stability (Theorem~\ref{thm:converge}) through a new Lyapunov function combining Perelman entropy with Wasserstein gradient flows, fundamentally advancing geometric deep learning.</description>

      <title>RCC-PFL: Robust Client Clustering under Noisy Labels in Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models. The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar. A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions. This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge. A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering. To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods. We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction.</description>

      <title>Personalized Continual EEG Decoding: Retaining and Transferring Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significant inter-subject variability in electroen-cephalogram (EEG) signals often results in substantial changes to neural network weights as data distributions shift. This variability frequently causes catastrophic forgetting in continual EEG decoding tasks, where previously acquired knowledge is overwritten as new subjects are introduced. While retraining the entire dataset for each new subject can mitigate forgetting, this approach imposes significant computational costs, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. Therefore, an ideal brain-computer interface (BCI) model should incrementally learn new information without requiring complete retraining, thereby reducing computational overhead. Existing EEG decoding meth-ods typically rely on large, centralized source-domain datasets for pre-training to improve model generalization. However, in practical scenarios, data availability is often constrained by privacy concerns. Furthermore, these methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in continual EEG decoding tasks, significantly limiting their utility in long-term learning scenarios. To address these issues, we propose the Personalized Continual EEG Decoding (PCED) framework for continual EEG decoding. The framework uses Euclidean Alignment for fast domain adap-tation, reducing inter-subject variability. To retain knowledge and prevent forgetting, it includes an exemplar replay mechanism that preserves key information from past tasks. A reservoir sampling-based memory management strategy optimizes exemplar storage to handle memory constraints in long-term learning. Experiments on the OpenBMI dataset with 54 subjects show that PCED balances knowledge retention and classification performance, providing an efficient solution for real-world BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Joint Phase Time Array: Opportunities, Challenges and System Design Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to designing millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular communication systems, based on joint phase time array (JPTA) radio frequency (RF) frontend architecture. JPTA architecture comprises time-delay components appended to conventional phase shifters, which offer extra degrees of freedom to be exploited for designing frequency-selective analog beams. Hence, a mmWave device equipped with JPTA can receive and transmit signals in multiple directions in a single time slot per RF chain, one direction per frequency subband, which alleviates the traditional constraint of one analog beam per transceiver chain per time slot. The utilization of subband-specific analog beams offers a new opportunity in designing mmWave systems, allowing for enhanced cell capacity and reduced pilot overhead. To understand the practical feasibility of JPTA, a few challenges and system design considerations are discussed in relation to the performance and complexity of the JPTA systems. For example, frequency-selective beam gain losses are present for the subband analog beams, e.g., up to 1 dB losses for 2 subband cases, even with the state-of-the-art JPTA delay and phase optimization methods. Despite these side effects, system-level analysis reveals that the JPTA system is capable of improving cell capacity: 5-percentile cell throughput by up to 65 per cent. To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper is the first paper explaining the system-level benefits and system-design challenges of JPTA, with an analysis of the performance tradeoff based on an intuitive metric of beam gain losses.</description>

      <title>Internet of Things-Based Smart Precision Farming in Soilless Agriculture:Opportunities and Challenges for Global Food Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population and the continuous decline in cultivable land pose significant threats to food security. This challenge worsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland. Soilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a sustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled environments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart precision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental control, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart farming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and automation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human intervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based soilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure greater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation. However, they also face challenges such as high initial investment, technological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive study, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research highlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation and scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits of vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled soilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address food security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.</description>

      <title>Joint Superimposed Pilot-aided Channel Estimation and Data Detection for FTN Signaling over Doubly-Selective Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling and superimposed pilot (SP) techniques are effective solutions for significantly enhancing the spectral efficiency (SE) in next-generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes an innovative SP-aided channel estimation method for FTN signaling enhancing the SE over doubly-selective (i.e., time- and frequency-selective) channels. To avoid complex channel tracking, we utilize a basis expansion model (BEM) to characterize doubly-selective channel variations. We propose a frame structure that superimposes a known periodic pilot sequence onto the information sequence, avoiding SE loss by eliminating the additional overhead of multiplexed pilot (MP). Additionally, we find the optimal FTN signaling SP sequence that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimation. Expanding on our proposed SP-aided channel estimation method, we propose two detection methods: (1) an SP-aided separate channel estimation and data detection (SCEDD) method performing a single channel estimation followed by iterative data detection via a turbo equalizer, serving as a baseline for evaluating the SP-aided channel estimation method, and (2) an SP-aided joint channel estimation and data detection (JCEDD) method, which extends the SCEDD by updating the channel estimate in each turbo equalization iteration, becoming our primary focus for its superior performance. At equivalent SE and a higher fading rate on the order of $10^{-3}$, our simulations show that SP-aided SCEDD method outperforms MP-aided techniques in both MSE and BER, while the SP-aided JCEDD method delivers remarkable performance, where reference approaches fail to track rapid channel variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a multi-channel self-reset analog-to-digital converter (ADC) system with complex-valued moduli has been proposed. This system enables the recovery of high dynamic range complex-valued bandlimited signals at low sampling rates via the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). In this paper, we investigate complex-valued CRT (C-CRT) with erroneous remainders, where the errors follow wrapped complex Gaussian distributions. Based on the existing real-valued CRT utilizing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we propose a fast MLE-based C-CRT (MLE C-CRT). The proposed algorithm requires only $2L$ searches to obtain the optimal estimate of the common remainder, where $L$ is the number of moduli. Once the common remainder is estimated, the complex number can be determined using the C-CRT. Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the fast MLE C-CRT to achieve robust estimation. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to ADCs. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid RIS With Sub-Connected Active Partitions: Performance Analysis and Transmission Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging reflecting intelligent surface (RIS) technology promises to enhance the capacity of wireless communication systems via passive reflect beamforming. However, the product path loss limits its performance gains. Fully-connected (FC) active RIS, which integrates reflect-type power amplifiers into the RIS elements, has been recently introduced in response to this issue. Also, sub-connected (SC) active RIS and hybrid FC-active/passive RIS variants, which employ a limited number of reflect-type power amplifiers, have been proposed to provide energy savings. Nevertheless, their flexibility in balancing diverse capacity requirements and power consumption constraints is limited. In this direction, this study introduces novel hybrid RIS structures, wherein at least one reflecting sub-surface (RS) adopts the SC-active RIS design. The asymptotic signal-to-noise-ratio of the FC-active/passive and the proposed hybrid RIS variants is analyzed in a single-user single-input single-output setup. Furthermore, the transmit and RIS beamforming weights are jointly optimized in each scenario to maximize the energy efficiency of a hybrid RIS-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system subject to the power consumption constraints of the base station and the active RSs. Numerical simulation and analytic results highlight the performance gains of the proposed RIS designs over benchmarks, unveil non-trivial trade-offs, and provide valuable insights.</description>

      <title>Imaging Intravoxel Vessel Size Distribution in the Brain Using Susceptibility Contrast Enhanced MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vascular remodelling is inherent to the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, fibrosis, hypertension, and diabetes. In this paper, a new susceptibility-contrast based MRI approach is established to non-invasively image intravoxel vessel size distribution (VSD), enabling a more comprehensive and quantitative assessment of vascular remodelling. The approach utilizes high-resolution light-sheet fluorescence microscopy images of rodent brain vasculature, simulating gradient echo sampling of free induction decay and spin echo (GESFIDE) MRI signals for the three-dimensional vascular networks, and training a deep learning model to predict cerebral blood volume (CBV) and VSD from GESFIDE signals. The results from ex vivo experiments demonstrated strong correlation (r = 0.96) between the true and predicted CBV. High similarity between true and predicted VSDs was observed (mean Bhattacharya Coefficient = 0.92). With further in vivo validation, intravoxel VSD imaging could become a transformative preclinical and clinical tool for interrogating disease and treatment induced vascular remodelling.</description>
