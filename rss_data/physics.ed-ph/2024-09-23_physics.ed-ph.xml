      <title>How we simulate DNA origami</title>

Abstract: DNA origami consists of a long scaffold strand and short staple strands that self-assemble into a target 2D or 3D shape. It is a widely used construct in nucleic acid nanotechnology, offering a cost-effective way to design and create diverse nanoscale shapes. With promising applications in areas such as nanofabrication, diagnostics, and therapeutics, DNA origami has become a key tool in the bionanotechnology field. Simulations of these structures can offer insight into their shape and function, thus speeding up and simplifying the design process. However, simulating these structures, often comprising thousands of base pairs, poses challenges due to their large size. OxDNA, a coarse-grained model specifically designed for DNA nanotechnology, offers powerful simulation capabilities. Its associated ecosystem of visualization and analysis tools can complement experimental work with in silico characterization. This tutorial provides a general approach to simulating DNA origami structures using the oxDNA ecosystem, tailored for experimentalists looking to integrate computational analysis into their design workflow.</description>

      <title>Introducing Quantum Information and Computation to a Broader Audience with MOOCs at OpenHPI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07241</link>

Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting field with high disruptive potential, but very difficult to access. For this reason, many approaches to teaching quantum computing are being developed worldwide.
  This always raises questions about the didactic concept, the content actually taught, and how to measure the success of the teaching concept. In 2022 and 2023, the authors taught a total of nine two-week MOOCs (massive open online courses) with different possible learning paths on the Hasso Plattner Institute's OpenHPI platform. The purpose of the platform is to make computer science education available to everyone free of charge. The nine quantum courses form a self-contained curriculum. A total of more than 17{,}000 course attendances have been taken by about 7400 natural persons, and the number is still rising. This paper presents the course concept and evaluates the anonymized data on the background of the participants, their behaviour in the courses, and their learning success.
  This paper is the first to analyze such a large dataset of MOOC-based quantum computing education. The summarized results are a heterogeneous personal background of the participants biased towards IT professionals, a majority following the didactic recommendations, and a high success rate, which is strongly correlatated with following the didactic recommendations. The amount of data from such a large group of quantum computing learners provides many avenues for further research in the field of quantum computing education. The analyses show that the MOOCs are a low-threshold concept for getting into quantum computing. It was very well received by the participants. The concept can serve as an entry point and guide for the design of quantum computing courses.</description>
