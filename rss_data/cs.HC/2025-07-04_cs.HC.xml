      <title>PAL: Designing Conversational Agents as Scalable, Cooperative Patient Simulators for Palliative-Care Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective communication in serious illness and palliative care is essential but often under-taught due to limited access to training resources like standardized patients. We present PAL (Palliative Assisted Learning-bot), a conversational system that simulates emotionally nuanced patient interactions and delivers structured feedback grounded in an existing empathy-based framework. PAL supports text and voice modalities and is designed to scaffold clinical skill-building through repeated, low-cost practice. Through a mixed-methods study with 17 U.S. medical trainees and clinicians, we explore user engagement with PAL, evaluate usability, and examine design tensions around modalities, emotional realism, and feedback delivery. Participants found PAL helpful for reflection and skill refinement, though some noted limitations in emotional authenticity and the adaptability of feedback. We contribute: (1) empirical evidence that large language models can support palliative communication training; (2) design insights for modality-aware, emotionally sensitive simulation tools; and (3) implications for systems that support emotional labor, cooperative learning, and AI-augmented training in high-stakes care settings.</description>

      <title>StorySpace: Technology supporting reflection, expression, and discourse in classroom narrative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The StorySpace project studies the role new interface technologies might play in high school education. With this approach in mind, StorySpace is specifically designed to support and enhance classroom narrative, an already well-established classroom activity. StorySpace strives to achieve this through adherence to three design goals. The first is to trigger student reflection and interpretation. The narrative medium created by StorySpace should represent the topic of classroom discussion and learning in all its complexity. In building their representation, the students will then be confronted with that same complexity. The medium should also itself be exciting and compelling, making classroom narrative interesting and fun.</description>

      <title>The Revolution Has Arrived: What the Current State of Large Language Models in Education Implies for the Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language Models have only been widely available since 2022 and yet in less than three years have had a significant impact on approaches to education and educational technology. Here we review the domains in which they have been used, and discuss a variety of use cases, their successes and failures. We then progress to discussing how this is changing the dynamic for learners and educators, consider the main design challenges facing LLMs if they are to become truly helpful and effective as educational systems, and reflect on the learning paradigms they support. We make clear that the new interaction paradigms they bring are significant and argue that this approach will become so ubiquitous it will become the default way in which we interact with technologies, and revolutionise what people expect from computer systems in general. This leads us to present some specific and significant considerations for the design of educational technology in the future that are likely to be needed to ensure acceptance by the changing expectations of learners and users.</description>

      <title>EvalAssist: A Human-Centered Tool for LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the broad availability of large language models and their ability to generate vast outputs using varied prompts and configurations, determining the best output for a given task requires an intensive evaluation process, one where machine learning practitioners must decide how to assess the outputs and then carefully carry out the evaluation. This process is both time-consuming and costly. As practitioners work with an increasing number of models, they must now evaluate outputs to determine which model and prompt performs best for a given task. LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators to filter training data, evaluate model performance, assess harms and risks, or assist human evaluators with detailed assessments. We present EvalAssist, a framework that simplifies the LLM-as-a-judge workflow. The system provides an online criteria development environment, where users can interactively build, test, and share custom evaluation criteria in a structured and portable format. We support a set of LLM-based evaluation pipelines that leverage off-the-shelf LLMs and use a prompt-chaining approach we developed and contributed to the UNITXT open-source library. Additionally, our system also includes specially trained evaluators to detect harms and risks in LLM outputs. We have deployed the system internally in our organization with several hundreds of users.</description>

      <title>VergeIO: Depth-Aware Eye Interaction on Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing industry interest in creating unobtrusive designs for electrooculography (EOG) sensing of eye gestures on glasses (e.g. JINS MEME and Apple eyewear). We present VergeIO, the first EOG-based glasses that enables depth-aware eye interaction using vergence with an optimized electrode layout and novel smart glass prototype. It can distinguish between four and six depth-based eye gestures with 83-98% accuracy using personalized models in a user study across 11 users and 1,320 gesture instances. It generalizes to unseen users with an accuracy of 80-98% without any calibration. To reduce false detections, we incorporate a motion artifact detection pipeline and a preamble-based activation scheme. The system uses dry sensors without any adhesives or gel, and operates in real time with 3 mW power consumption by the sensing front-end, making it suitable for always-on sensing.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Internal States in Collaborative Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is a complex cognitive, social, and emotional process that is increasingly prevalent in educational and professional settings. This study investigates the emotional states of individuals during CPS using a mixed-methods approach. Teams of four first completed a novel CPS task. Immediately after, each individual was placed in an isolated room where they reviewed the video of their group performing the task and self-reported their internal experiences throughout the task. We performed a linguistic analysis of these internal monologues, providing insights into the range of emotions individuals experience during CPS. Our analysis showed distinct patterns in language use, including characteristic unigrams and bigrams, key words and phrases, emotion labels, and semantic similarity between emotion-related words.</description>

      <title>A framework for 3D interaction techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a software architecture for 3D interaction techniques (ITs) and an object oriented, toolkit-independent framework that implements such architecture. ITs are composed of basic filters connected in a dataflow, where virtual input devices and objects in the scene are sources of information. An execution model defines the general flow of information between filters. This framework has been designed to be extensible: new information types, new input devices, new execution models, or new interaction techniques can easily be added. Application specific code and application specific ITs are seamlessly integrated into this architecture.</description>

      <title>Misaligned from Within: Large Language Models Reproduce Our Double-Loop Learning Blindness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a critical yet unexplored dimension of the AI alignment problem: the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to inherit and amplify existing misalignments between human espoused theories and theories-in-use. Drawing on action science research, we argue that LLMs trained on human-generated text likely absorb and reproduce Model 1 theories-in-use - a defensive reasoning pattern that both inhibits learning and creates ongoing anti-learning dynamics at the dyad, group, and organisational levels. Through a detailed case study of an LLM acting as an HR consultant, we show how its advice, while superficially professional, systematically reinforces unproductive problem-solving approaches and blocks pathways to deeper organisational learning. This represents a specific instance of the alignment problem where the AI system successfully mirrors human behaviour but inherits our cognitive blind spots. This poses particular risks if LLMs are integrated into organisational decision-making processes, potentially entrenching anti-learning practices while lending authority to them. The paper concludes by exploring the possibility of developing LLMs capable of facilitating Model 2 learning - a more productive theory-in-use - and suggests this effort could advance both AI alignment research and action science practice. This analysis reveals an unexpected symmetry in the alignment challenge: the process of developing AI systems properly aligned with human values could yield tools that help humans themselves better embody those same values.</description>

      <title>Human-Centered Explainability in Interactive Information Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-centered explainability has become a critical foundation for the responsible development of interactive information systems, where users must be able to understand, interpret, and scrutinize AI-driven outputs to make informed decisions. This systematic survey of literature aims to characterize recent progress in user studies on explainability in interactive information systems by reviewing how explainability has been conceptualized, designed, and evaluated in practice. Following PRISMA guidelines, eight academic databases were searched, and 100 relevant articles were identified. A structural encoding approach was then utilized to extract and synthesize insights from these articles. The main contributions include 1) five dimensions that researchers have used to conceptualize explainability; 2) a classification scheme of explanation designs; 3) a categorization of explainability measurements into six user-centered dimensions. The review concludes by reflecting on ongoing challenges and providing recommendations for future exploration of related issues. The findings shed light on the theoretical foundations of human-centered explainability, informing the design of interactive information systems that better align with diverse user needs and promoting the development of systems that are transparent, trustworthy, and accountable.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Heuristic Evaluation: A Comparison between AI- and Human-Powered Usability Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly, requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation. However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations. Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic heuristic evaluations.</description>

      <title>From Coarse to Fine-Grained Emotion Annotation: An Immediate Recall Paradigm with Validation through Physiological Evidence and Recognition Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional video-induced emotion physiological datasets often use whole-trial annotation, assigning a single emotion label to all data collected during an entire trial. This coarse-grained annotation approach misaligns with the dynamic and temporally localized nature of emotional responses as they unfold with video narratives, introducing label noise that limits emotion recognition algorithm evaluation and performance. To solve the label noise problem caused by coarse-grained annotation, we propose a fine-grained annotation method through an immediate recall paradigm. This paradigm integrates an immediate video replay phase after the initial stimulus viewing, allowing participants to precisely mark the onset timestamp, emotion label, and intensity based on their immediate recall. We validate this paradigm through physiological evidence and recognition performance. Physiological validation of multimodal signals within participant-marked windows revealed rhythm-specific EEG patterns and arousal-dependent GSR responses-with SCRs appearing in 91% of high-arousal versus 6% of low-arousal emotion windows. These objective physiological data changes strongly aligned with subjective annotations, confirming annotation precision. For recognition performance, classification experiments showed that models trained on fine-grained annotations achieved 9.7% higher accuracy than traditional whole-trial labeling, despite using less data. This work not only addresses label noise through fine-grained annotation but also demonstrates that annotation precision outweighs data scale in determining emotion recognition performance.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Rhythmic Haptic Biofeedback via Smartwatch for Relaxation and Sleep Onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of musically structured, closed-loop vibration patterns as a passive biofeedback intervention for relaxation and sleep initiation. By encoding rhythmic meter structures into smartwatch vibrations and adapting their frequency to be slightly slower than the user's real-time heart rate, our system aims to reduce arousal through tactile entrainment, offering a non-invasive alternative to auditory or open-loop approaches previously used in sleep and anxiety contexts. In the first study (N=20), we compared five adaptive vibration rhythms for their effects on heart rate and subjective perceptions of relaxation in a resting context. In the second study (N=28), we evaluated the most promising pattern from Study 1 in a prolonged sleep initiation setting. Results showed increased parasympathetic activity and perceived relaxation during short-term stimulation, but no significant effects on sleep-related measures during the sleep onset phase. This work contributes to the understanding of how wearable haptic feedback can support relaxation and sleep, offering design insights and identifying methodological considerations for effectively integrating haptic interaction into self-directed interventions.</description>

      <title>Haptic Biofeedback for Wakeful Rest: Does Stimulation Location Make a Difference?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable haptic interventions offer promising support for relaxation through slow, vibrotactile biofeedback. Despite their potential, current applications focus on stress-inducing procedures and fixed vibration patterns, with limited consideration of body location and dynamic biofeedback during restful states. This study investigates the effects of haptic biofeedback adjusted from real-time heart rate during eyes-closed wakeful rest, comparing four wearable body placements: the wrist, hand, forearm, and shoulder. Heart rate, alpha wave activity on the ear, subjective restfulness, and vibration experience were measured across these conditions. Results show that biofeedback reduced heart rate at the wrist, shoulder, and forearm, while alpha power measured at the ear remained unchanged. Subjective restfulness was rated highest at the shoulder and forearm, which were also the most preferred locations. In addition, participants reported greater comfort, relaxation, and further increased sleepiness at the forearm compared to the wrist, which was more easily recognizable. These findings suggest that the forearm and shoulder are ideal for unobtrusive relaxation feedback for wakeful rest, while the wrist may require design improvements for subjective experience.</description>

      <title>Are You Listening to Me? Fine-Tuning Chatbots for Empathetic Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments. While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent agents.</description>

Unfortunately, the typical tracking subsystems used with CAVE displays tether the user and lessen this advantage. We have designed a simple, low-cost feet tracker that is wireless, leaving the user free to move. The tracker can be assembled for less than $200 US, and achieves an accuracy of 10 cm at a 20 Hz sampling rate. We have tested the prototype with two applications: a visualization supporting close visual inspection, and a walkthrough of the campus. Although the tracking was convincing, it was clear that the tracker's limitations make it less than ideal for applications requiring precise visual inspection. However, the freedom of motion allowed by the tracker was a compelling supplement to our campus walkthrough, allowing users to stroll and look around corners.</description>

      <title>Who's Sorry Now: User Preferences Among Rote, Empathic, and Explanatory Apologies from LLM Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As chatbots driven by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in everyday contexts, their ability to recover from errors through effective apologies is critical to maintaining user trust and satisfaction. In a preregistered study with Prolific workers (N=162), we examine user preferences for three types of apologies (rote, explanatory, and empathic) issued in response to three categories of common LLM mistakes (bias, unfounded fabrication, and factual errors). We designed a pairwise experiment in which participants evaluated chatbot responses consisting of an initial error, a subsequent apology, and a resolution. Explanatory apologies were generally preferred, but this varied by context and user. In the bias scenario, empathic apologies were favored for acknowledging emotional impact, while hallucinations, though seen as serious, elicited no clear preference, reflecting user uncertainty. Our findings show the complexity of effective apology in AI systems. We discuss key insights such as personalization and calibration that future systems must navigate to meaningfully repair trust.</description>

      <title>Time-Masked Transformers with Lightweight Test-Time Adaptation for Neural Speech Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech neuroprostheses aim to restore communication for people with severe paralysis by decoding speech directly from neural activity. To accelerate algorithmic progress, a recent benchmark released intracranial recordings from a paralyzed participant attempting to speak, along with a baseline decoding algorithm. Prior work on the benchmark showed impressive accuracy gains. However, these gains increased computational costs and were not demonstrated in a real-time decoding setting. Here, we make three contributions that pave the way towards accurate, efficient, and real-time neural speech decoding. First, we incorporate large amounts of time masking during training. On average, over $50\%$ of each trial is masked. Second, we replace the gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture used in the baseline algorithm with a compact Transformer. The Transformer architecture uses $77\%$ fewer parameters, cuts peak GPU memory usage by $36\%$ relative, and is significantly faster to calibrate relative to the GRU. Third, we design a lightweight variant of an existing test-time adaptation method developed for decoding handwriting from neural activity. Our variant adapts the model using multiple time masked augmentations of a single trial and requires only one gradient step per trial. Together, these contributions reduce word error rate by $19.5\%$ and effectively mitigate performance degradations across held-out days in a real-time decoding setting while substantially lowering computational costs.</description>

      <title>Measurement as Bricolage: Examining How Data Scientists Construct Target Variables for Predictive Modeling Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy, hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the "healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints. Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem (re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g., predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings, we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better support the art and science of target variable construction.</description>

      <title>Optimising task allocation to balance business goals and worker well-being for financial service workforces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Financial service companies manage huge volumes of data which requires timely error identification and resolution. The associated tasks to resolve these errors frequently put financial analyst workforces under significant pressure leading to resourcing challenges and increased business risk. To address this challenge, we introduce a formal task allocation model which considers both business orientated goals and analyst well-being.
  Methodology: We use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimise our formal model to allocate and schedule tasks to analysts. The proposed solution is able to allocate tasks to analysts with appropriate skills and experience, while taking into account staff well-being objectives.
  Findings: We demonstrate our GA model outperforms baseline heuristics, current working practice, and is applicable to a range of single and multi-objective real-world scenarios. We discuss the potential for metaheuristics (such as GAs) to efficiently find sufficiently good allocations which can provide recommendations for financial service managers in-the-loop.
  Originality: A key gap in existing allocation and scheduling models, is fully considering worker well-being. This paper presents an allocation model which explicitly optimises for well-being while still improving on current working practice for efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI tools - most notably large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Codex - are rapidly revolutionizing computer science education. These tools can generate, debug, and explain code, thereby transforming the landscape of programming instruction. This paper examines the profound opportunities that AI offers for enhancing computer science education in general, from coding assistance to fostering innovative pedagogical practices and streamlining assessments. At the same time, it highlights challenges including academic integrity concerns, the risk of over-reliance on AI, and difficulties in verifying originality. We discuss what computer science educators should teach in the AI era, how to best integrate these technologies into curricula, and the best practices for assessing student learning in an environment where AI can generate code, prototypes and user feedback. Finally, we propose a set of policy recommendations designed to harness the potential of generative AI while preserving the integrity and rigour of computer science education. Empirical data and emerging studies are used throughout to support our arguments.</description>

      <title>Public perspectives on the design of fusion energy facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As fusion energy technologies approach demonstration and commercial deployment, understanding public perspectives on future fusion facilities will be critical for achieving social license, especially because fusion energy facilities, unlike large fission reactors, may be sited in closer proximity to people and communities, due to distinct regulatory frameworks. In a departure from the 'decide-announce-defend' approach typically used to site energy infrastructure, we develop a participatory design methodology for collaboratively designing fusion energy facilities with prospective host communities. We present here our findings from a participatory design workshop that brought together 22 community participants and 34 engineering students. Our analysis of the textual and visual data from this workshop shows a range of design values and decision-making criteria with 'integrity' and 'respect' ranking highest among values and 'economic benefits' and 'environmental protection/safety' ranking highest among decision-making criteria. Salient design themes that emerge across facility concepts include connecting the history and legacy of the community to the design of the facility, care for workers, transparency and access to the facility, and health and safety of the host community. Participants reported predominantly positive sentiments, expressing joy and surprise as the workshop progressed from learning about fusion to designing the hypothetical facility. Our findings suggest that carrying out participatory design in the early stages of technology development can invite and make concrete public hopes and concerns, improve understanding of, and curiosity about, an emerging technology, build toward social license, and inform context-specific development of fusion energy facilities.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based EEG Decoding: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture, which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these, Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic Transformer with other deep learning techniques (convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>DigiT4TAF -- Bridging Physical and Digital Worlds for Future Transportation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the future, mobility will be strongly shaped by the increasing use of digitalization. Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected, but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments. This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany. The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at: https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of security-related scenarios in the communications sector.</description>

      <title>MISC: Minimal Intervention Shared Control with Guaranteed Safety under Non-Convex Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics, teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66 participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.</description>

      <title>TFOC-Net: A Short-time Fourier Transform-based Deep Learning Approach for Enhancing Cross-Subject Motor Imagery Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Human-Machine Collaboration and Ethical Considerations in Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1) developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS, focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Active Learning under (Human) Label Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature, highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the complexities of real-world annotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haptic sciences and technologies benefit greatly from comprehensive datasets that capture tactile stimuli under controlled, systematic conditions. However, existing haptic databases collect data through uncontrolled exploration, which hinders the systematic analysis of how motion parameters (e.g., motion direction and velocity) influence tactile perception. This paper introduces Cluster Haptic Texture Database, a multimodal dataset recorded using a 3-axis machine with an artificial finger to precisely control sliding velocity and direction. The dataset encompasses 118 textured surfaces across 9 material categories, with recordings at 5 velocity levels (20-60 mm/s) and 8 directions. Each surface was tested under 160 conditions, yielding 18,880 synchronized recordings of audio, acceleration, force, position, and visual data. Validation using convolutional neural networks demonstrates classification accuracies of 96% for texture recognition, 88.76% for velocity estimation, and 78.79% for direction estimation, confirming the dataset's utility for machine learning applications. This resource enables research in haptic rendering, texture recognition algorithms, and human tactile perception mechanisms, supporting the development of realistic haptic interfaces for virtual reality systems and robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Human-Computer Interaction and Visualization in Natural Language Generation Models: Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) models have emerged as a focal point of research within natural language processing (NLP), exhibiting remarkable performance in tasks such as text composition and dialogue generation. However, their intricate architectures and extensive model parameters pose significant challenges to interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes decision-making scenarios. To address this issue, human-computer interaction (HCI) and visualization techniques offer promising avenues to enhance the transparency and usability of NLG models by making their decision-making processes more interpretable. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive investigation into the roles, limitations, and impact of HCI and visualization in facilitating human understanding and control over NLG systems. We introduce a taxonomy of interaction methods and visualization techniques, categorizing three major research domains and their corresponding six key tasks in the application of NLG models. Finally, we summarize the shortcomings in the existing work and investigate the key challenges and emerging opportunities in the era of large language models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>Crafting Hanzi as Narrative Bridges: An AI Co-Creation Workshop for Elderly Migrants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores how older adults, particularly aging migrants in urban China, can engage AI-assisted co-creation to express personal narratives that are often fragmented, underrepresented, or difficult to verbalize. Through a pilot workshop combining oral storytelling and the symbolic reconstruction of Hanzi, participants shared memories of migration and recreated new character forms using Xiaozhuan glyphs, suggested by the Large Language Model (LLM), together with physical materials. Supported by human facilitation and a soft AI presence, participants transformed lived experience into visual and tactile expressions without requiring digital literacy. This approach offers new perspectives on human-AI collaboration and aging by repositioning AI not as a content producer but as a supportive mechanism, and by supporting narrative agency within sociotechnical systems.</description>

      <title>Learning From Crowdsourced Noisy Labels: A Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the primary catalysts fueling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is the availability of massive, curated datasets. A commonly used technique to curate such massive datasets is crowdsourcing, where data are dispatched to multiple annotators. The annotator-produced labels are then fused to serve downstream learning and inference tasks. This annotation process often creates noisy labels due to various reasons, such as the limited expertise, or unreliability of annotators, among others. Therefore, a core objective in crowdsourcing is to develop methods that effectively mitigate the negative impact of such label noise on learning tasks. This feature article introduces advances in learning from noisy crowdsourced labels. The focus is on key crowdsourcing models and their methodological treatments, from classical statistical models to recent deep learning-based approaches, emphasizing analytical insights and algorithmic developments. In particular, this article reviews the connections between signal processing (SP) theory and methods, such as identifiability of tensor and nonnegative matrix factorization, and novel, principled solutions of longstanding challenges in crowdsourcing -- showing how SP perspectives drive the advancements of this field. Furthermore, this article touches upon emerging topics that are critical for developing cutting-edge AI/ML systems, such as crowdsourcing in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) that are key techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of Privacy-Preserving Protocols for Agent-Facilitated Mobile Money Services in Kenya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile Money (MoMo), a technology that allows users to complete financial transactions using a mobile phone without requiring a bank account, is a common method for processing financial transactions in Africa and other developing regions. Users can deposit and withdraw money with the help of human agents. During deposit and withdraw operations, know-your-customer (KYC) processes require agents to access and verify customer information such as name and ID number, which can introduce privacy and security risks. In this work, we design alternative protocols for MoMo deposits/withdrawals that protect users' privacy while enabling KYC checks by redirecting the flow of sensitive information from the agent to the MoMo provider. We evaluate the usability and efficiency of our proposed protocols in a role-play and semi-structured interview study with 32 users and 15 agents in Kenya. We find that users and agents prefer the new protocols, due in part to convenient and efficient verification using biometrics as well as better data privacy and access control. However, our study also surfaced challenges that need to be addressed before these protocols can be deployed.</description>

      <title>ForceGrip: Reference-Free Curriculum Learning for Realistic Grip Force Control in VR Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic Hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods. Demo videos are available as supplementary material and the code is provided at https://han-dongheun.github.io/ForceGrip.</description>

      <title>HAPI: A Model for Learning Robot Facial Expressions from Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic robotic facial expression generation is crucial for human-robot interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human affective responses.</description>
