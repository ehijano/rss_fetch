      <title>Spike Talk in Power Electronic Grids -- Leveraging Post Moore's Computing Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging distributed generation demands highly reliable and resilient coordinating control in microgrids. To improve on these aspects, spiking neural network is leveraged, as a grid-edge intelligence tool to establish a talkative infrastructure, Spike Talk, expediting coordination in next-generation microgrids without the need of communication at all. This paper unravels the physics behind Spike Talk from the perspective of its distributed infrastructure, which aims to address the Von Neumann Bottleneck. Relying on inferring information via power flows in tie lines, Spike Talk allows adaptive and flexible control and coordination itself, and features in synaptic plasticity facilitating online and local training functionality. Preliminary case studies are demonstrated with results, while more extensive validations are to be included as future scopes of work.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Aware Optimization of In-Memory Bayesian Binary Neural Network Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled estimates of model and data uncertainty by encoding parameters as distributions. This makes them key enablers for reliable AI that can be deployed on safety critical edge systems. These systems can be made resource efficient by restricting synapses to two synaptic states $\{-1,+1\}$ and using a memristive in-memory computing (IMC) paradigm. However, BNNs pose an additional challenge -- they require multiple instantiations for ensembling, consuming extra resources in terms of energy and area. In this work, we propose a novel sparsity-aware optimization for Bayesian Binary Neural Network (BBNN) accelerators that exploits the inherent BBNN sampling sparsity -- most of the network is made up of synapses that have a high probability of being fixed at $\pm1$ and require no sampling. The optimization scheme proposed here exploits the sampling sparsity that exists both among layers, i.e only a few layers of the network contain a majority of the probabilistic synapses, as well as the parameters i.e., a tiny fraction of parameters in these layers require sampling, reducing total sampled parameter count further by up to $86\%$. We demonstrate no loss in accuracy or uncertainty quantification performance for a VGGBinaryConnect network on CIFAR-100 dataset mapped on a custom sparsity-aware phase change memory (PCM) based IMC simulator. We also develop a simple drift compensation technique to demonstrate robustness to drift-induced degradation. Finally, we project latency, energy, and area for sparsity-aware BNN implementation in both pipelined and non-pipelined modes. With sparsity-aware implementation, we estimate upto $5.3 \times$ reduction in area and $8.8\times$ reduction in energy compared to a non-sparsity-aware implementation. Our approach also results in $2.9 \times $ more power efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art BNN accelerator.</description>

      <title>Bayes2IMC: In-Memory Computing for Bayesian Binary Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide superior estimates of uncertainty by generating an ensemble of predictive distributions. However, inference via ensembling is resource-intensive, requiring additional entropy sources to generate stochasticity which increases resource consumption. We introduce Bayes2IMC, an in-memory computing (IMC) architecture designed for binary Bayesian neural networks that leverage nanoscale device stochasticity to generate desired distributions. Our novel approach utilizes Phase-Change Memory (PCM) to harness inherent noise characteristics, enabling the creation of a binary neural network. This design eliminates the necessity for a pre-neuron Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), significantly improving power and area efficiency. We also develop a hardware-software co-optimized correction method applied solely on the logits in the final layer to reduce device-induced accuracy variations across deployments on hardware. Additionally, we devise a simple compensation technique that ensures no drop in classification accuracy despite conductance drift of PCM. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a VGGBinaryConnect model, achieving accuracy metrics comparable to ideal software implementations as well as results reported in the literature using other technologies. Finally, we present a complete core architecture and compare its projected power, performance, and area efficiency against an equivalent SRAM baseline, showing a $3.8$ to $9.6 \times$ improvement in total efficiency (in GOPS/W/mm$^2$) and a $2.2 $ to $5.6 \times$ improvement in power efficiency (in GOPS/W). In addition, the projected hardware performance of Bayes2IMC surpasses that of most of the BNN architectures based on memristive devices reported in the literature, and achieves up to $20\%$ higher power efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage Analysis of Quantum Kernel in Gene Expression Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incorporation of quantum ansatz with machine learning classification models demonstrates the ability to extract patterns from data for classification tasks. However, taking advantage of the enhanced computational power of quantum machine learning necessitates dealing with various constraints. In this paper, we focus on constraints like finding suitable datasets where quantum advantage is achievable and evaluating the relevance of features chosen by classical and quantum methods. Additionally, we compare quantum and classical approaches using benchmarks and estimate the computational complexity of quantum circuits to assess real-world usability. For our experimental validation, we selected the gene expression dataset, given the critical role of genetic variations in regulating physiological behavior and disease susceptibility. Through this study, we aim to contribute to the advancement of quantum machine learning methodologies, offering valuable insights into their potential for addressing complex classification challenges in various domains.</description>

      <title>SDN-Based Smart Cyber Switching (SCS) for Cyber Restoration of a Digital Substation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, critical infrastructure and power grids have increasingly been targets of cyber-attacks, causing widespread and extended blackouts. Digital substations are particularly vulnerable to such cyber incursions, jeopardizing grid stability. This paper addresses these risks by proposing a cybersecurity framework that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) to bolster the resilience of substations based on the IEC-61850 standard. The research introduces a strategy involving smart cyber switching (SCS) for mitigation and concurrent intelligent electronic device (CIED) for restoration, ensuring ongoing operational integrity and cybersecurity within a substation. The SCS framework improves the physical network's behavior (i.e., leveraging commercial SDN capabilities) by incorporating an adaptive port controller (APC) module for dynamic port management and an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and counteract malicious IEC-61850-based sampled value (SV) and generic object-oriented system event (GOOSE) messages within the substation's communication network. The framework's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive simulations and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed, demonstrating its ability to sustain substation operations during cyber-attacks and significantly improve the overall resilience of the power grid.</description>
