      <title>Vanka-smoothed shifted Laplacian multigrid preconditioners for the Helmholtz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved multigrid preconditioner for the acoustic Helmholtz equation with enhanced scalability. Standard multigrid fails to converge for the Helmholtz equation, and the well-known complex shifted Laplacian method overcomes it by adding a complex shift and using the shifted system as a preconditioner. However, the added complex shift grows with the frequency and interferes with the preconditioner's scalability. In this work, we present an additive Vanka smoother that requires a much lower shift than point-wise smoothers, and thereby enhances the scalability. By carefully designing different ingredients of the multigrid cycle, the presented method enables deep V-cycles with a small and bounded shift, even when many levels are used. We validate our method theoretically by local Fourier analysis, and hold numerical experiments for homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We show that our method outperforms plain shifted Laplacian in terms of runtimes and performs well on challenging geophysical media in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Scatter-Limited Hybrid Monte Carlo, Deterministic Transport with Quasi-Monte Carlo Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid method for time-dependent particle transport that combines Monte Carlo (MC) estimation with a deterministic discrete ordinates (\(S_N\)) solve, augmented by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling. For spatial discretizations, the MC component computes a piecewise-constant (cell-averaged) solution, while the \(S_N\) stage employs bilinear discontinuous finite elements. By hybridizing the formulation, the MC subproblem after a prescribed scatter limit becomes scattering-free, yielding a simple and efficient streaming/attenuation procedure. Between time steps, a simple scatter-free MC step is run to relabel the $S_N$ solution as an MC solution.
  A key feature of the approach is a tunable parameter \(N_{s}\) that controls how many material collisions are handled in the (Q)MC leg before handing off to the deterministic \(S_N\) solve; \(N_s=0\) recovers a purely uncollided MC leg, while \(N_s&gt;0\) produces multi-scatter hybrids. QMC replaces pseudorandom draws with low-discrepancy points in the existing MC sampling maps, enabling a plug-in adoption within the standard MC code with modest, localized changes.
  We observe significant accuracy and convergence rate improvements through the use of QMC and practically no additional computational cost, which are generally not seen in comparable non-hybrid solves. We believe the multi-scatter approach provides additional flexibility in terms of parallelization and the choice of deterministic solver.</description>

      <title>A Robust GPU-Accelerated Kernel Compensation Solver with Novel Discretization for Photonic Crystals in Pseudochiral Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a robust solver for the Maxwell eigenproblem in 3D photonic crystals (PCs) with pseudochiral media. The solver employs the Kernel Compensation technique under the framework of Yee's scheme to eliminate null space and enable matrix-free, GPU-accelerated operations via 3D discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Furthermore, we propose a novel discretization for permittivity tensor containing off-diagonal entries and rigorously prove that the resulting matrix is Hermitian positive definite (HPD), which ensures the correctness of the kernel compensation technique. Numerical experiments on several benchmark examples are demonstrated to validate the robustness and accuracy of our scheme.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of an Endemic Time Delay Model Using Dirac and Radon Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the convergence properties of an $SLIR^\text{T}R^\text{P}D$ endemic model, incorporating Dirac and Radon measures, alongside distributed delays to represent latency and temporary immunity. A class of delays is defined for both continuous and discrete endemic models using continuous integral kernels with compact support and discrete terms expressed through Dirac and Radon measures. Numerical results show that the continuous model can be approximated by a discrete lag endemic model. Furthermore, the simulation time for the numerical solution is significantly shorter than that for the exact solution.</description>

      <title>Two kinds of parametric piecewise rational interpolation kernels for image magnification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the constructions of piecewise rational interpolation kernels that are supported on the interval $[-2,2]$, and present one novel rational cubic/linear and five quartic/linear interpolation kernels. All proposed kernels are symmetric, $C^1$ continuous, and possess certain degrees of approximation order. The proposed quartic/linear interpolation kernels include the cubic and the cubic/linear interpolation kernel as special cases. Our numerical results show that one of the quartic/linear interpolation kernels can outperform the cubic interpolation kernel in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and FSIM.</description>

      <title>A Semismooth Newton Solver and its application to an $hp$-FE Discretization in Elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of systems of nonlinear equations, which arise in discretized mixed formulations of problems in solid mechanics by $hp$-finite elements. We introduce a semismooth Newton solver for this specific class and prove its well-definedness and local convergence. Thereby, the analysis heavily relies on a special eigenvalue interplay of two matrices involved in the considered nonlinear system. Next, we apply the general results to an $hp$-finite element discretization of a problem in elastoplasticity, which can be formulated as a system of nonlinear equations of the above type by using biorthogonal basis functions. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the proposed semismooth Newton solver with respect to $h$ and $p$.</description>

      <title>ATMPlace: Analytical Thermo-Mechanical-Aware Placement Framework for 2.5D-IC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising demand in AI and automotive applications is accelerating 2.5D IC adoption, with multiple chiplets tightly placed to enable high-speed interconnects and heterogeneous integration. As chiplet counts grow, traditional placement tools, limited by poor scalability and reliance on slow simulations, must evolve beyond wirelength minimization to address thermal and mechanical reliability, critical challenges in heterogeneous integration. In this paper, we present ATMPlace, the first analytical placer for 2.5D ICs that jointly optimizes wirelength, peak temperature, and operational warpage using physics-based compact models. It generates Pareto optimal placements for systems with dozens of chiplets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance: 146 percent and 52 percent geometric mean wirelength improvement over TAP 2.5D and TACPlace, respectively, with 3 to 13 percent lower temperature and 5 to 27 percent less warpage, all achieved approximately 10 times faster. The proposed framework is general and can be extended to enable fast, scalable, and reliable design exploration for next-generation 2.5D systems.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Cascade Semi-Lagrangian Method for Solving the Vlasov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cascade remapping method, originally proposed by Nair et al. (2002) for atmospheric modeling, enables efficient and mass conservative semi Lagrangian (SL) transport through successive one dimensional remapping. While widely used in geophysical flows, its application to plasma kinetics remains limited. To exploit its potential advantages in conservation and scalability, this work applies the conservative cascade semi Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to the Vlasov equation and related plasma models. A consistency analysis shows that the scheme attains second order spatial accuracy, with the dominant error arising from the geometric approximation of the backtracked region. Moreover, two improvements are introduced: a freestream preserving correction that ensures exact volume conservation, and a maximum principle limiter that suppresses spurious oscillations while maintaining positivity and mass conservation. Numerical tests, including linear advection, guiding center, and relativistic Vlasov Maxwell models, confirm the high accuracy, robustness, and long term stability of the improved CCSL method. Compared with the conservative semi Lagrangian (CSL) and the backward semi Lagrangian (BSL) schemes, it better preserves physical invariants under divergence free conditions, providing a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity plasma kinetic simulations with good parallel scalability.</description>

      <title>A DSMC method for the space homogeneous multispecies Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new representation of entropy solutions to nonlinear scalar conservation laws with a smooth convex flux function in a single spatial dimension. The representation is a generalization of the method of characteristics and posseses a compositional form. While it is a nonlinear representation, the embedded dynamics of the solution in the time variable is linear. This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure. Finally, we show that the low rank neural representation with a fixed number of layers and a small number of coefficients can approximate any entropy solution regardless of the complexity of the shock topology, while retaining the linearity of the embedded dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Schr\"odingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schr\"odinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schr\"odinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schr\"odingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schr\"odingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on providing full implementation details for Worsey-Farin (WF) spline interpolation over tetrahedral elements. While this spline space is not new and the theory has been covered in other works, there is a lack of explicit and comprehensive implementation details, which we hope to provide. In this paper, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the WF-spline space through a simple target application: solution transfer. Moreover, we derive an error estimate for the WF spline-based, solution transfer process. We conduct numerical experiments quantifying the conservative nature and order of accuracy of the transfer process, and we present a qualitative evaluation of the visualization properties of the smoothed solution. Additionally, in our study of conservation, we demonstrate how adaptive numerical quadrature rules on the tetrahedron used in conjunction with global L2-projection can improve the conservation of the solution transfer process.</description>

      <title>Reduced basis solvers for unfitted methods on parameterized domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified framework for reduced basis approximations of parametrized partial differential equations defined on parameter-dependent domains. Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Multi-order Runge-Kutta methods or how to numerically solve initial value problems of any order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When one wishes to numerically solve an initial value problem, it is customary to rewrite it as an equivalent first-order system to which a method, usually from the class of Runge-Kutta methods, is applied. Directly treating higher-order initial value problems without such rewriting, however, allows for significantly greater accuracy. We therefore introduce a new generalization of Runge-Kutta methods, called multi-order Runge-Kutta methods, designed to solve initial value problems of arbitrary order. We establish fundamental properties of these methods, including convergence, order of consistency, and linear stability. We also analyze the structure of the system satisfied by the approximations of a method, which enables us to provide a proper definition of explicit methods and to gain a finer understanding of implicit methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal risk mitigation by deep reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an insurance company which faces financial risk in the form of insurance claims and market-dependent surplus fluctuations. The company aims to simultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting period) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing reinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal wealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the problem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding maximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cram\'er-Lundberg model perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Linear Convergence of ADMM for Isotropic TV Norm Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an explicit local linear rate for ADMM solving the isotropic Total Variation (TV) norm compressed sensing problem in multiple dimensions, by analyzing the auxiliary variable in the equivalent Douglas-Rachford splitting on a dual problem. Numerical verification on large 3D problems and real MRI data will be shown. Though the proven rate is not sharp, it is close to the observed ones in numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound must be transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used to predict beam aberration, assess cranial heating, and correct the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers at ultrasound frequencies. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull bone. We show that our approach effectively simulates transcranial ultrasound, even when using the original CT voxels as the computational mesh, where the 0.5 mm voxel length is relatively coarse compared to the shortest wavelength of 3 mm. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations using a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer reveal significant beam distortion of 7.8 mm attributed to the skull's heterogeneous acoustical properties.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-temporal CP decomposition analysis of New England region in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatio temporal data consist of measurement for one or more raster fields such as weather, traffic volume, crime rate, or disease incidents. Advances in modern technology have increased the number of available information for this type of data hence the rise of multidimensional data. In this paper we take advantage of the multidimensional structure of the data but also its temporal and spatial structure. In fact, we will be using the NCAR Climate Data Gateway website which provides data discovery and access services for global and regional climate model data. The daily values of total precipitation (prec), maximum (tmax), and minimum (tmin) temperature are combined to create a multidimensional data called tensor (a multidimensional array). In this paper, we propose a spatio temporal principal component analysis to initialize CP decomposition component. We take full advantage of the spatial and temporal structure of the data in the initialization step for cp component analysis. The performance of our method is tested via comparison with most popular initialization method. We also run a clustering analysis to further show the performance of our analysis.</description>
