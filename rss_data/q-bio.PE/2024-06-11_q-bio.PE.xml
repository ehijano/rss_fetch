      <title>Tree balance in phylogenetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05185v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree shape statistics, particularly measures of tree (im)balance, play an important role in the analysis of the shape of phylogenetic trees. With applications ranging from testing evolutionary models to studying the impact of fertility inheritance and selection, or tumor development and language evolution, the assessment of tree balance is crucial. Currently, a multitude of at least 30 (im)balance indices can be found in the literature, alongside numerous other tree shape statistics.
  This diversity prompts essential questions: How can we minimize the selection of indices to mitigate the challenges of multiple testing? Is there a preeminent balance index tailored to specific tasks? Previous studies comparing the statistical power of indices in detecting trees deviating from the Yule model have been limited in scope, utilizing only a subset of indices and alternative tree models.
  This research expands upon the examination of index power, encompassing all established indices and a broader array of alternative models. Our investigation reveals distinct groups of balance indices better suited for different tree models, suggesting that decisions on balance index selection can be enhanced with prior knowledge. Furthermore, we present the \textsf{R} software package \textsf{poweRbal} which allows the inclusion of new indices and models, thus facilitating future research.</description>

      <title>Revisiting institutional punishment in the $N$-person prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conflict between individual and collective interests makes fostering cooperation in human societies a challenging task, requiring drastic measures such as the establishment of sanctioning institutions. These institutions are costly because they have to be maintained regardless of the presence or absence of offenders. Here, we propose realistic improvements to the standard $N$-person prisoner's dilemma formulation with institutional punishment by eliminating overpunishment, requiring a minimum number of contributors to establish the sanctioning institution, and sharing the cost among them once this minimum number is reached. In addition, we focus on large groups or communities for which sanctioning institutions are ubiquitous. Using the replicator equation framework for an infinite population, we find that by sufficiently fining players who fail to contribute either to the public good or to the sanctioning institution, a population of contributors immune to invasion by these free riders can be established, provided that the contributors are sufficiently numerous. In a finite population, we use finite-size scaling to show that, for some parameter settings, demographic noise helps to fixate the strategy that contributes to the public good but not to the sanctioning institution even for infinitely large populations when, somewhat counterintuitively, its proportion in the initial population vanishes with a small power of the population size.</description>

      <title>Unbiased likelihood estimation of Wright-Fisher diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation strategy for discretely observed Wright-Fisher diffusions. Our approach provides an unbiased estimator of the likelihood function and is based on exact simulation techniques that are of special interest for diffusion processes defined on a bounded domain, where numerical methods typically fail to remain within the required boundaries. We start by building unbiased likelihood estimators for scalar diffusions and later present an extension to the multidimensional case. Consistency results of our proposed estimator are also presented and the performance of our method is illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Self-Reproduction and Evolution in Cellular Automata: 25 Years after Evoloops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The year of 2024 marks the 25th anniversary of the publication of evoloops, an evolutionary variant of Chris Langton's self-reproducing loops which proved constructively that Darwinian evolution of self-reproducing organisms by variation and natural selection is possible within deterministic cellular automata. Over the last few decades, this line of Artificial Life research has since undergone several important developments. Although it experienced a relative dormancy of activities for a while, the recent rise of interest in open-ended evolution and the success of continuous cellular automata models have brought researchers' attention back to how to make spatio-temporal patterns self-reproduce and evolve within spatially distributed computational media. This article provides a review of the relevant literature on this topic over the past 25 years and highlights the major accomplishments made so far, the challenges being faced, and promising future research directions.</description>
