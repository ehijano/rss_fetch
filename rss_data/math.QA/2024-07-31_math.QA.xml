      <title>Wormhole Renormalization: The gravitational path integral, holography, and a gauge group for topology change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Factorization Paradox from the bottom up by adapting methods from perturbative renormalization. Just as quantum field theories are plagued with loop divergences that need to be cancelled systematically by introducing counterterms, gravitational path integrals are plagued by wormhole contributions that spoil the factorization of the holographic dual. These wormholes must be cancelled by some stringy effects in a UV complete, holographic theory of quantum gravity. In a simple model of two-dimensional topological gravity, we outline a gravitational analog of the recursive BPHZ procedure in order to systematically introduce ``counter-wormholes" which parametrize the unknown stringy effects that lead to factorization. Underlying this procedure is a Hopf algebra of symmetries which is analogous to the Connes--Kreimer Hopf algebra underlying perturbative renormalization. The group dual to this Hopf algebra acts to reorganize contributions from spacetimes with distinct topology, and can be seen as a gauge group relating various equivalent ways of constructing a factorizing gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>On Integrality of Non-Semisimple Quantum Representations of Mapping Class Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a root of unity $\zeta$ of odd prime order, we restrict coefficients of non-semisimple quantum representations of mapping class groups associated with the small quantum group $\mathfrak{u}_\zeta \mathfrak{sl}_2$ from $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ to $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$. We do this by exhibiting explicit bases of states spaces that span $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta]$-lattices that are invariant under projective actions of mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analyses of the Type D ASEP: Stochastic Fusion and Crystal Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Type D asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a particle system involving two classes of particles that can be viewed from both a probabilistic and an algebraic perspective (arXiv:2011.13473). From a probabilistic perspective, we perform stochastic fusion on the Type D ASEP and analyze the outcome on generator matrices, limits of drift speed, stationary distributions, and Markov self-duality. From an algebraic perspective, we construct a fused Type D ASEP system from a Casimir element of $U_q(so_6)$, using crystal bases to analyze and manipulate various representations of $U_q(so_6)$. We conclude that both approaches produce different processes and therefore the previous method of arXiv:1908.02359, which analyzed the usual ASEP, does not generalize to all finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algebra of Chern-Simons Matrix Model and Large $N$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the algebra of quantum observables of the Chern-Simons matrix model which was originally proposed by Susskind and Polychronakos to describe electrons in fractional quantum Hall effects. We establish the commutation relations for its generators and study the large $N$ limit of its representation. We show that the large $N$ limit algebra is isomorphic to the uniform in $N$ algebra studied by Costello, which is isomorphic to the deformed double current algebra studied by Guay. Under appropriate scaling limit, we show that the large $N$ limit algebra degenerates to a Lie algebra which admits a surjective map to the affine Lie algebra of $\mathfrak{u}(p)$. This leads to a complete proof of the large $N$ emergence of the $\mathfrak{u}(p)$ current algebra as proposed by Dorey, Tong and Turner. This also suggests a rigorous derivation of edge excitation of a fractional quantum Hall droplet.</description>

      <title>Quantum group coproducts and universality under scalar extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the families of bialgebras or Hopf algebras over fields for which the product in the corresponding category is finite-dimensional, answering a question of M. Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $&gt;1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $&gt;1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature); (b) algebraic field extensions as those along which finite coalgebra (bialgebra, Hopf algebra) products are preserved; and (c) again algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.</description>
