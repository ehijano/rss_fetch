      <title>Temporal Brightness Management for Immersive Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern virtual reality headsets demand significant computational resources to render high-resolution content in real-time. Therefore, prioritizing power efficiency becomes crucial, particularly for portable versions reliant on batteries. A significant portion of the energy consumed by these systems is attributed to their displays. Dimming the screen can save a considerable amount of energy; however, it may also result in a loss of visible details and contrast in the displayed content. While contrast may be partially restored by applying post-processing contrast enhancement steps, our work is orthogonal to these approaches, and focuses on optimal temporal modulation of screen brightness. We propose a technique that modulates brightness over time while minimizing the potential loss of visible details and avoiding noticeable temporal instability. Given a predetermined power budget and a video sequence, we achieve this by measuring contrast loss through band decomposition of the luminance image and optimizing the brightness level of each frame offline to ensure uniform temporal contrast loss. We evaluate our method through a series of subjective experiments and an ablation study, on a variety of content. We showcase its power-saving capabilities in practice using a built-in hardware proxy. Finally, we present an online version of our approach which further emphasizes the potential for low level vision models to be leveraged in power saving settings to preserve content quality.</description>

      <title>MAP-based Problem-Agnostic diffusion model for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have indeed shown great promise in solving inverse problems in image processing. In this paper, we propose a novel, problem-agnostic diffusion model called the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based guided term estimation method for inverse problems. We divide the conditional score function into two terms according to Bayes' rule: the unconditional score function and the guided term. We design the MAP-based guided term estimation method, while the unconditional score function is approximated by an existing score network. To estimate the guided term, we base on the assumption that the space of clean natural images is inherently smooth, and introduce a MAP estimate of the $t$-th latent variable. We then substitute this estimation into the expression of the inverse problem and obtain the approximation of the guided term. We evaluate our method extensively on super-resolution, inpainting, and denoising tasks, and demonstrate comparable performance to DDRM, DMPS, DPS and $\Pi$GDM.</description>

      <title>End-to-end localized deep learning for Cryo-ET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables 3D visualization of cellular environments. Accurate reconstruction of high-resolution volumes is complicated by the very low signal-to-noise ratio and a restricted range of sample tilts, creating a missing wedge of Fourier information. Recent self-supervised deep learning approaches, which post-process initial reconstructions done by filtered backprojection (FBP), have significantly improved reconstruction quality, but they are computationally expensive, demand large memory, and require retraining for each new dataset. End-to-end supervised learning is an appealing alternative but is impeded by the lack of ground truth and the large memory demands of high-resolution volumetric data. Training on synthetic data often leads to overfitting and poor generalization to real data, and, to date, no general end-to-end deep learning reconstructors exist for cryo-ET. In this work, we introduce CryoLithe, a local, memory-efficient reconstruction network that directly estimates the volume from an aligned tilt-series, overcoming the suboptimal FBP. We demonstrate that leveraging transform-domain locality makes our network robust to distribution shifts, enabling effective supervised training and giving excellent results on real data -- without retraining or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Feasibility of Patch-based Inference for Generalized Diffusion Priors in Inverse Problems for Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plug-and-play approaches to solving inverse problems such as restoration and super-resolution have recently benefited from Diffusion-based generative priors for natural as well as medical images. However, solutions often use the standard albeit computationally intensive route of training and inferring with the whole image on the diffusion prior. While patch-based approaches to evaluating diffusion priors in plug-and-play methods have received some interest, they remain an open area of study. In this work, we explore the feasibility of the usage of patches for training and inference of a diffusion prior on MRI images. We explore the minor adaptation necessary for artifact avoidance, the performance and the efficiency of memory usage of patch-based methods as well as the adaptability of whole image training to patch-based evaluation - evaluating across multiple plug-and-play methods, tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for decoding images from brain activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has recently propelled the decoding of images from brain activity. How do these approaches scale with the amount and type of neural recordings? Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication with Entropy-and-Channel-Adaptive Rate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional wireless image transmission methods struggle to balance rate efficiency and reconstruction quality under varying channel conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semantic communication (SemCom) system that integrates entropy-aware and channel-adaptive mechanisms for wireless image transmission over multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) fading channels. Unlike existing approaches, our system dynamically adjusts transmission rates based on the entropy of feature maps, channel state information (CSI), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ensuring optimal resource utilization and robust performance. The system employs feature map pruning, channel attention, spatial attention, and multihead self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms to prioritize critical semantic features and effectively reconstruct images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, including BPG+LDPC+4QAM and Deep JSCC, in terms of rate-distortion performance, flexibility, and robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low SNR, imperfect CSI, and inter-user interference. This work establishes a strong foundation for adaptive-rate SemCom systems and highlights their potential for real-time, bandwidthintensive applications.</description>

      <title>Stroke Lesion Segmentation using Multi-Stage Cross-Scale Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise characterization of stroke lesions from MRI data has immense value in prognosticating clinical and cognitive outcomes following a stroke. Manual stroke lesion segmentation is time-consuming and requires the expertise of neurologists and neuroradiologists. Often, lesions are grossly characterized for their location and overall extent using bounding boxes without specific delineation of their boundaries. While such characterization provides some clinical value, to develop a precise mechanistic understanding of the impact of lesions on post-stroke vascular contributions to cognitive impairments and dementia (VCID), the stroke lesions need to be fully segmented with accurate boundaries. This work introduces the Multi-Stage Cross-Scale Attention (MSCSA) mechanism, applied to the U-Net family, to improve the mapping between brain structural features and lesions of varying sizes. Using the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) v2.0 dataset, MSCSA outperforms all baseline methods in both Dice and F1 scores on a subset focusing on small lesions, while maintaining competitive performance across the entire dataset. Notably, the ensemble strategy incorporating MSCSA achieves the highest scores for Dice and F1 on both the full dataset and the small lesion subset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of MSCSA in segmenting small lesions and highlight its robustness across different training schemes for large stroke lesions.

      <title>FlatTrack: Eye-tracking with ultra-thin lensless cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing eye trackers use cameras based on thick compound optical elements, necessitating the cameras to be placed at focusing distance from the eyes. This results in the overall bulk of wearable eye trackers, especially for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) headsets. We overcome this limitation by building a compact flat eye gaze tracker using mask-based lensless cameras. These cameras, in combination with co-designed lightweight deep neural network algorithm, can be placed in extreme close proximity to the eye, within the eyeglasses frame, resulting in ultra-flat and lightweight eye gaze tracker system. We collect a large dataset of near-eye lensless camera measurements along with their calibrated gaze directions for training the gaze tracking network. Through real and simulation experiments, we show that the proposed gaze tracking system performs on par with conventional lens-based trackers while maintaining a significantly flatter and more compact form-factor. Moreover, our gaze regressor boasts real-time (&gt;125 fps) performance for gaze tracking.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Low-computation Global Correlation Loss for Monotonicity Evaluation in Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a global monotonicity consistency training strategy for quality assessment, which includes a differentiable, low-computation monotonicity evaluation loss function and a global perception training mechanism. Specifically, unlike conventional ranking loss and linear programming approaches that indirectly implement the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) function, our method directly converts SROCC into a loss function by making the sorting operation within SROCC differentiable and functional. Furthermore, to mitigate the discrepancies between batch optimization during network training and global evaluation of SROCC, we introduce a memory bank mechanism. This mechanism stores gradient-free predicted results from previous batches and uses them in the current batch's training to prevent abrupt gradient changes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on both images and point clouds quality assessment tasks, demonstrating performance gains in both cases.</description>

      <title>Comparative clinical evaluation of "memory-efficient" synthetic 3d generative adversarial networks (gan) head-to-head to state of art: results on computed tomography of the chest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This study introduces a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture, incorporating Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to generate high-resolution 3D medical images and evaluates its performance against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model.
  Materials and Methods: The CRF-GAN was trained using the open-source lung CT LUNA16 dataset. The architecture was compared to HA-GAN through a quantitative evaluation, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, in order to assess the realism of the generated images.
  Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID (0.047 vs. 0.061) and MMD (0.084 vs. 0.086) scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN with a p-value of 1.93e-05. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage at 256 resolution and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings.
  Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. Computational power and time saved can be used to improve the spatial resolution and anatomical accuracy of generated images, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Tumor Detection, Segmentation and Classification Challenge on Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound: The TDSC-ABUS Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection helps in reducing the number of deaths. Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) is a newer approach for breast screening, which has many advantages over handheld mammography such as safety, speed, and higher detection rate of breast cancer. Tumor detection, segmentation, and classification are key components in the analysis of medical images, especially challenging in the context of 3D ABUS due to the significant variability in tumor size and shape, unclear tumor boundaries, and a low signal-to-noise ratio. The lack of publicly accessible, well-labeled ABUS datasets further hinders the advancement of systems for breast tumor analysis. Addressing this gap, we have organized the inaugural Tumor Detection, Segmentation, and Classification Challenge on Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound 2023 (TDSC-ABUS2023). This initiative aims to spearhead research in this field and create a definitive benchmark for tasks associated with 3D ABUS image analysis. In this paper, we summarize the top-performing algorithms from the challenge and provide critical analysis for ABUS image examination. We offer the TDSC-ABUS challenge as an open-access platform at https://tdsc-abus2023.grand-challenge.org/ to benchmark and inspire future developments in algorithmic research.</description>

      <title>Radiologist-in-the-Loop Self-Training for Generalizable CT Metal Artifact Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal artifacts in computed tomography (CT) images can significantly degrade image quality and impede accurate diagnosis. Supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods, trained using simulated datasets, often struggle to perform well on real clinical CT images due to a substantial domain gap. Although state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods use pseudo ground-truths generated by a prior network to mitigate this issue, their reliance on a fixed prior limits both the quality and quantity of these pseudo ground-truths, introducing confirmation bias and reducing clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Radiologist-In-the-loop SElf-training framework for MAR, termed RISE-MAR, which can integrate radiologists' feedback into the semi-supervised learning process, progressively improving the quality and quantity of pseudo ground-truths for enhanced generalization on real clinical CT images. For quality assurance, we introduce a clinical quality assessor model that emulates radiologist evaluations, effectively selecting high-quality pseudo ground-truths for semi-supervised training. For quantity assurance, our self-training framework iteratively generates additional high-quality pseudo ground-truths, expanding the clinical dataset and further improving model generalization. Extensive experimental results on multiple clinical datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of our RISE-MAR over state-of-the-art methods, advancing the development of MAR models for practical application.

      <title>SeqSeg: Learning Local Segments for Automatic Vascular Model Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling of cardiovascular function has become a critical part of diagnosing, treating and understanding cardiovascular disease. Most strategies involve constructing anatomically accurate computer models of cardiovascular structures, which is a multistep, time-consuming process. To improve the model generation process, we herein present SeqSeg (sequential segmentation): a novel deep learning based automatic tracing and segmentation algorithm for constructing image-based vascular models. SeqSeg leverages local U-Net-based inference to sequentially segment vascular structures from medical image volumes. We tested SeqSeg on CT and MR images of aortic and aortofemoral models and compared the predictions to those of benchmark 2D and 3D global nnU-Net models, which have previously shown excellent accuracy for medical image segmentation. We demonstrate that SeqSeg is able to segment more complete vasculature and is able to generalize to vascular structures not annotated in the training data.</description>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis for optimal patient management. In recent years, advancements in deep learning have shown remarkable potential in medical image analysis. Methods In this study, we present "ViTranZheimer," an AD diagnosis approach which leverages video vision transformers to analyze 3D brain MRI data. By treating the 3D MRI volumes as videos, we exploit the temporal dependencies between slices to capture intricate structural relationships. The video vision transformer's self-attention mechanisms enable the model to learn long-range dependencies and identify subtle patterns that may indicate AD progression. Our proposed deep learning framework seeks to enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of AD diagnosis, empowering clinicians with a tool for early detection and intervention. We validate the performance of the video vision transformer using the ADNI dataset and conduct comparative analyses with other relevant models. Results The proposed ViTranZheimer model is compared with two hybrid models, CNN-BiLSTM and ViT-BiLSTM. CNN-BiLSTM is the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long-short-term memory network (BiLSTM), while ViT-BiLSTM is the combination of a vision transformer (ViT) with BiLSTM. The accuracy levels achieved in the ViTranZheimer, CNN-BiLSTM, and ViT-BiLSTM models are 98.6%, 96.479%, and 97.465%, respectively. ViTranZheimer demonstrated the highest accuracy at 98.6%, outperforming other models in this evaluation metric, indicating its superior performance in this specific evaluation metric. Conclusion This research advances the understanding of applying deep learning techniques in neuroimaging and Alzheimer's disease research, paving the way for earlier and less invasive clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Geometric Deep Learning for Automated Landmarking of Maxillary Arches on 3D Oral Scans from Newborns with Cleft Lip and Palate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advances in 3D model scanning have enabled the mass digitization of dental clay models. However, most clinicians and researchers continue to use manual morphometric analysis methods on these models such as landmarking. This is a significant step in treatment planning for craniomaxillofacial conditions. We aimed to develop and test a geometric deep learning model that would accurately and reliably label landmarks on a complicated and specialized patient population -- infants, as accurately as a human specialist without a large amount of training data. Our developed pipeline demonstrated an accuracy of 94.44% with an absolute mean error of 1.676 +/- 0.959 mm on a set of 100 models acquired from newborn babies with cleft lip and palate. Our proposed pipeline has the potential to serve as a fast, accurate, and reliable quantifier of maxillary arch morphometric features, as well as an integral step towards a future fully automated dental treatment pipeline.</description>

      <title>Z-Stack Scanning can Improve AI Detection of Mitosis: A Case Study of Meningiomas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Z-stack scanning is an emerging whole slide imaging technology that captures multiple focal planes alongside the z-axis of a glass slide. Because z-stacking can offer enhanced depth information compared to the single-layer whole slide imaging, this technology can be particularly useful in analyzing small-scaled histopathological patterns. However, its actual clinical impact remains debated with mixed results. To clarify this, we investigate the effect of z-stack scanning on artificial intelligence (AI) mitosis detection of meningiomas. With the same set of 22 Hematoxylin and Eosin meningioma glass slides scanned by three different digital pathology scanners, we tested the performance of three AI pipelines on both single-layer and z-stacked whole slide images (WSIs). Results showed that in all scanner-AI combinations, z-stacked WSIs significantly increased AI's sensitivity (+17.14%) on the mitosis detection with only a marginal impact on precision. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that highlights z-stack scanning as a promising technique for AI mitosis detection, paving the way for more reliable AI-assisted pathology workflows, which can ultimately benefit patient management.</description>

      <title>Pfungst and Clever Hans: Identifying the unintended cues in a widely used Alzheimer's disease MRI dataset using explainable deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backgrounds.
  Deep neural networks have demonstrated high accuracy in classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to enlighten the underlying black-box nature and reveal individual contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric information and preprocessing on classification performance.
  Methods.
  We utilized T1w MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to distinguish matched AD patients (990 MRIs) from healthy controls (990 MRIs). Preprocessing included skull stripping and binarization at varying thresholds to systematically eliminate texture information. A deep neural network was trained on these configurations, and the model performance was compared using McNemar tests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and structural similarity metrics between heatmaps were applied to analyze learned features.
  Results.
  Classification performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) were comparable across all configurations, indicating a negligible influence of T1w gray- and white signal texture. Models trained on binarized images demonstrated similar feature performance and relevance distributions, with volumetric features such as atrophy and skull-stripping features emerging as primary contributors.
  Conclusions.
  We revealed a previously undiscovered Clever Hans effect in a widely used AD MRI dataset. Deep neural networks classification predominantly rely on volumetric features, while eliminating gray-white matter T1w texture did not decrease the performance. This study clearly demonstrates an overestimation of the importance of gray-white matter contrasts, at least for widely used structural T1w images, and highlights potential misinterpretation of performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Compensation based Dictionary Transfer for Similar Multispectral Image Spectral Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a spectral dictionary learned from a couple of similar-scene multi- and hyperspectral image, it is possible to reconstruct a desired hyperspectral image only with one single multispectral image. However, the differences between the similar scene and the desired hyperspectral image make it difficult to directly apply the spectral dictionary from the training domain to the task domain. To this end, a compensation matrix based dictionary transfer method for the similar-scene multispectral image spectral super-resolution is proposed in this paper, trying to reconstruct a more accurate high spatial resolution hyperspectral image. Specifically, a spectral dictionary transfer scheme is established by using a compensation matrix with similarity constraint, to transfer the spectral dictionary learned in the training domain to the spectral super-resolution domain. Subsequently, the sparse coefficient matrix is optimized under sparse and low-rank constraints. Experimental results on two AVIRIS datasets from different scenes indicate that, the proposed method outperforms other related SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Brain Tumor Detection in Intraoperative Ultrasound Using YOLO11: From Model Training to Deployment in the Operating Room</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) is a valuable tool in brain tumor surgery due to its versatility, affordability, and seamless integration into the surgical workflow. However, its adoption remains limited, primarily because of the challenges associated with image interpretation and the steep learning curve required for effective use. This study aimed to enhance the interpretability of ioUS images by developing a real-time brain tumor detection system deployable in the operating room. We collected 2D ioUS images from the Brain Tumor Intraoperative Database (BraTioUS) and the public ReMIND dataset, annotated with expert-refined tumor labels. Using the YOLO11 architecture and its variants, we trained object detection models to identify brain tumors. The dataset included 1,732 images from 192 patients, divided into training, validation, and test sets. Data augmentation expanded the training set to 11,570 images. In the test dataset, YOLO11s achieved the best balance of precision and computational efficiency, with a mAP@50 of 0.95, mAP@50-95 of 0.65, and a processing speed of 34.16 frames per second. The proposed solution was prospectively validated in a cohort of 15 consecutively operated patients diagnosed with brain tumors. Neurosurgeons confirmed its seamless integration into the surgical workflow, with real-time predictions accurately delineating tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of real-time object detection algorithms to enhance ioUS-guided brain tumor surgery, addressing key challenges in interpretation and providing a foundation for future development of computer vision-based tools for neuro-oncological surgery.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Angular Representation Learning for High-Fidelity Continuous Super-Resolution in Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) often suffers from low spatial and angular resolution due to inherent limitations in imaging hardware and system noise, adversely affecting the accurate estimation of microstructural parameters with fine anatomical details. Deep learning-based super-resolution techniques have shown promise in enhancing dMRI resolution without increasing acquisition time. However, most existing methods are confined to either spatial or angular super-resolution, limiting their effectiveness in capturing detailed microstructural features. Furthermore, traditional pixel-wise loss functions struggle to recover intricate image details essential for high-resolution reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose SARL-dMRI, a novel Spatial-Angular Representation Learning framework for high-fidelity, continuous super-resolution in dMRI. SARL-dMRI explores implicit neural representations and spherical harmonics to model continuous spatial and angular representations, simultaneously enhancing both spatial and angular resolution while improving microstructural parameter estimation accuracy. To further preserve image fidelity, a data-fidelity module and wavelet-based frequency loss are introduced, ensuring the super-resolved images remain consistent with the original input and retain fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to five other state-of-the-art methods, our method significantly enhances dMRI data resolution, improves the accuracy of microstructural parameter estimation, and provides better generalization capabilities. It maintains stable performance even under a 45$\times$ downsampling factor.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Weighted Average Ensemble Model for Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Ray Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of illness and death in children, underscoring the need for early and accurate detection. In this study, we propose a novel lightweight ensemble model for detecting pneumonia in children using chest X-ray images. This ensemble model integrates two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2 and NASNetMobile, selected for their balance of computational efficiency and accuracy. These models were fine-tuned on a pediatric chest X-ray dataset and combined to enhance classification performance. Our proposed ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.63%, significantly outperforming individual models such as MobileNetV2 (97.10%) and NASNetMobile(96.25%) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, the ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed lightweight ensemble model presents a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for pneumonia detection, making it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Brain-Adapter: Enhancing Neurological Disorder Analysis with Adapter-Tuning Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding brain disorders is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.</description>

      <title>Efficient Video Neural Network Processing Based on Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video neural network (VNN) processing using the conventional pipeline first converts Bayer video information into human understandable RGB videos using image signal processing (ISP) on a pixel by pixel basis. Then, VNN processing is performed on a frame by frame basis. Both ISP and VNN are computationally expensive with high power consumption and latency. In this paper, we propose an efficient VNN processing framework. Instead of using ISP, computer vision tasks are directly accomplished using Bayer pattern information. To accelerate VNN processing, motion estimation is introduced to find temporal redundancies in input video data so as to avoid repeated and unnecessary computations. Experiments show greater than 67\% computation reduction, while maintaining computer vision task accuracy for typical computer vision tasks and data sets.</description>

      <title>DDUNet: Dual Dynamic U-Net for Highly-Efficient Cloud Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud segmentation amounts to separating cloud pixels from non-cloud pixels in an image. Current deep learning methods for cloud segmentation suffer from three issues. (a) Constrain on their receptive field due to the fixed size of the convolution kernel. (b) Lack of robustness towards different scenarios. (c) Requirement of a large number of parameters and limitations for real-time implementation. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Dynamic U-Net (DDUNet) for supervised cloud segmentation. The DDUNet adheres to a U-Net architecture and integrates two crucial modules: the dynamic multi-scale convolution (DMSC), improving merging features under different reception fields, and the dynamic weights and bias generator (DWBG) in classification layers to enhance generalization ability. More importantly, owing to the use of depth-wise convolution, the DDUNet is a lightweight network that can achieve 95.3% accuracy on the SWINySEG dataset with only 0.33M parameters, and achieve superior performance over three different configurations of the SWINySEg dataset in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study forms the basis of a digital twin system of the knee joint, using advanced quantitative MRI (qMRI) and machine learning to advance precision health in osteoarthritis (OA) management and knee replacement (KR) prediction. We combined deep learning-based segmentation of knee joint structures with dimensionality reduction to create an embedded feature space of imaging biomarkers. Through cross-sectional cohort analysis and statistical modeling, we identified specific biomarkers, including variations in cartilage thickness and medial meniscus shape, that are significantly associated with OA incidence and KR outcomes. Integrating these findings into a comprehensive framework represents a considerable step toward personalized knee-joint digital twins, which could enhance therapeutic strategies and inform clinical decision-making in rheumatological care. This versatile and reliable infrastructure has the potential to be extended to broader clinical applications in precision health.</description>

      <title>Marker Track: Accurate Fiducial Marker Tracking for Evaluation of Residual Motions During Breath-Hold Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiducial marker positions in projection image of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans have been studied to evaluate daily residual motion during breath-hold radiation therapy. Fiducial marker migration posed challenges in accurately locating markers, prompting the development of a novel algorithm that reconstructs volumetric probability maps of marker locations from filtered gradient maps of projections. This guides the development of a Python-based algorithm to detect fiducial markers in projection images using Meta AI's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). Retrospective data from a pancreatic cancer patient with two fiducial markers were analyzed. The three-dimensional (3D) marker positions from simulation computed tomography (CT) were compared to those reconstructed from CBCT images, revealing a decrease in relative distances between markers over time. Fiducial markers were successfully detected in 2777 out of 2786 projection frames. The average standard deviation of superior-inferior (SI) marker positions was 0.56 mm per breath-hold, with differences in average SI positions between two breath-holds in the same scan reaching up to 5.2 mm, and a gap of up to 7.3 mm between the end of the first and beginning of the second breath-hold. 3D marker positions were calculated using projection positions and confirmed marker migration. This method effectively calculates marker probability volume and enables accurate fiducial marker tracking during treatment without requiring any specialized equipment, additional radiation doses, or manual initialization and labeling. It has significant potential for automatically assessing daily residual motion to adjust planning margins, functioning as an adaptive radiation therapy tool.</description>

      <title>UDBE: Unsupervised Diffusion-based Brightness Enhancement in Underwater Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activities in underwater environments are paramount in several scenarios, which drives the continuous development of underwater image enhancement techniques. A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

      <title>R2C-GAN: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks for Blind X-Ray Restoration and COVID-19 Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restoration of poor quality images with a blended set of artifacts plays a vital role for a reliable diagnosis. Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</description>

      <title>Once-Training-All-Fine: No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment via Domain-relevance Degradation Description</title>

Abstract: The visual quality of point clouds plays a crucial role in the development and broadcasting of immersive media. Therefore, investigating point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) is instrumental in facilitating immersive media applications, including virtual reality and augmented reality applications. Considering reference point clouds are not available in many cases, no-reference (NR) metrics have become a research hotspot. Existing NR methods suffer from difficult training. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel NR-PCQA method, Point Cloud Quality Assessment via Domain-relevance Degradation Description (D$^3$-PCQA). First, we demonstrate our model's interpretability by deriving the function of each module using a kernelized ridge regression model. Specifically, quality assessment can be characterized as a leap from the scattered perceptual domain (reflecting subjective perception) to the ordered quality domain (reflecting mean opinion score). Second, to reduce the significant domain discrepancy, we establish an intermediate domain, the description domain, based on insights from the human visual system (HVS), by considering the domain relevance among samples located in the perception domain and learning a structured latent space. The anchor features derived from the learned latent space are generated as cross-domain auxiliary information to promote domain transformation. Furthermore, the newly established description domain decomposes the NR-PCQA problem into two relevant stages. These stages include a classification stage that gives the degradation descriptions to point clouds and a regression stage to determine the confidence degrees of descriptions, providing a semantic explanation for the predicted quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that D$^3$-PCQA exhibits robust performance and outstanding generalization on several publicly available datasets.</description>

      <title>Scanning diffraction imaging without stable illumination and scan position information</title>

Abstract: Ptychography has become prominent at synchrotron facilities worldwide for characterizing biological and material specimens' topological structures and properties at the nanometer or atomic scale, due to its lens - less, highly quantitative phase imaging. Its high - resolution imaging depends on accurate lateral scan position info, a large overlap ratio, and a stable probe function. But as research moves to atomic scales, meeting these requirements gets harder, often needing high - precision motion control and manual pre - calibration. This paper presents a new imaging framework. By adding a wavefront modulator and a new phase retrieval workflow, it removes the strict requirements of traditional ptychography. Significantly, our method doesn't need pre - calibration of the wavefront modulator. Optical validation showed the deviation between the recovered position and a top - tier motion stage was less than 10 nm. Sub - pixel position accuracy was achievable even with a 13% overlap ratio. In an X - ray experiment with a spatially unstable probe violating the ptychographic model and an 18% overlap ratio, our method simultaneously and quantitatively retrieved beam spatial deviation, scan position, probe function, and sample transmission function. Notably, it measured probe spatial deviations of 500nm along the X - axis and 50nm along the Y - axis, which is not feasible by previous methods. With these experimentally proven advantages, we anticipate our method to be a powerful imaging tool with auto - quantitative calibration of various parameters. It will simplify scanning diffraction microscopy implementation and expand its application scope, especially in nanometer and atomic scale imaging.</description>

      <title>A Modified da Vinci Surgical Instrument for OCE based Elasticity Estimation with Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic procedures, e.g., precise movement of the surgical instruments, improved dexterity, and high-resolution visualization of the surgical field. However, mechanical tissue properties may provide additional information, e.g., on the location of lesions or vessels. While elastographic imaging has been proposed, it is not readily available as an online modality during robot-assisted surgery. We propose modifying a da~Vinci surgical instrument to realize optical coherence elastography (OCE) for quantitative elasticity estimation. The modified da~Vinci instrument is equipped with piezoelectric elements for shear wave excitation and we employ fast optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to track propagating wave fields, which are directly related to biomechanical tissue properties. All high-voltage components are mounted at the proximal end outside the patient. We demonstrate that external excitation at the instrument shaft can effectively stimulate shear waves, even when considering damping. Comparing conventional and deep learning-based signal processing, resulting in mean absolute errors of 19.27 kPa and 6.29 kPa, respectively. These results illustrate that precise quantitative elasticity estimates can be obtained. We also demonstrate quantitative elasticity estimation on ex-vivo tissue samples of heart, liver and stomach, and show that the measurements can be used to distinguish soft and stiff tissue types.</description>

      <title>Learning Point Spread Function Invertibility Assessment for Image Deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep-learning (DL)-based image deconvolution (ID) has exhibited remarkable recovery performance, surpassing traditional linear methods. However, unlike traditional ID approaches that rely on analytical properties of the point spread function (PSF) to achieve high recovery performance - such as specific spectrum properties or small conditional numbers in the convolution matrix - DL techniques lack quantifiable metrics for evaluating PSF suitability for DL-assisted recovery. Aiming to enhance deconvolution quality, we propose a metric that employs a non-linear approach to learn the invertibility of an arbitrary PSF using a neural network by mapping it to a unit impulse. A lower discrepancy between the mapped PSF and a unit impulse indicates a higher likelihood of successful inversion by a DL network. Our findings reveal that this metric correlates with high recovery performance in DL and traditional methods, thereby serving as an effective regularizer in deconvolution tasks. This approach reduces the computational complexity over conventional condition number assessments and is a differentiable process. These useful properties allow its application in designing diffractive optical elements through end-to-end (E2E) optimization, achieving invertible PSFs, and outperforming the E2E baseline framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pneumonia, a prevalent respiratory infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations. Chest X-rays serve as a primary tool for pneumonia detection; however, variations in imaging conditions and subtle visual indicators complicate consistent interpretation. Automated tools can enhance traditional methods by improving diagnostic reliability and supporting clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a novel multi-scale transformer approach for pneumonia detection that integrates lung segmentation and classification into a unified framework. Our method introduces a lightweight transformer-enhanced TransUNet for precise lung segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 95.68% on the "Chest X-ray Masks and Labels" dataset with fewer parameters than traditional transformers. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, which are then processed through a modified transformer module to enhance pneumonia detection. This integration of multi-scale feature extraction and lightweight transformer modules ensures robust performance, making our method suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Our approach achieves 93.75% accuracy on the "Kermany" dataset and 96.04% accuracy on the "Cohen" dataset, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of multi-scale transformer architectures to improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to global healthcare challenges."https://github.com/amirrezafateh/Multi-Scale-Transformer-Pneumonia"</description>

      <title>MSFMamba: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion State Space Model for Multi-Source Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of multi-source remote sensing image classification, remarkable progress has been made by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer. Recently, Mamba-based methods built upon the State Space Model (SSM) have shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, but they have rarely been explored for multi-source remote sensing image classification tasks. To address this issue, we propose the Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Mamba (MSFMamba) network, a novel framework designed for the joint classification of hyperspectral image (HSI) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)/Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The MSFMamba network is composed of three key components: the Multi-Scale Spatial Mamba (MSpa-Mamba) block, the Spectral Mamba (Spe-Mamba) block, and the Fusion Mamba (Fus-Mamba) block. The MSpa-Mamba block employs a multi-scale strategy to reduce computational cost and alleviate feature redundancy in multiple scanning routes, ensuring efficient spatial feature modeling. The Spe-Mamba block focuses on spectral feature extraction, addressing the unique challenges of HSI data representation. Finally, the Fus-Mamba block bridges the heterogeneous gap between HSI and LiDAR/SAR data by extending the original Mamba architecture to accommodate dual inputs, enhancing cross-modal feature interactions and enabling seamless data fusion. Together, these components enable MSFMamba to effectively tackle the challenges of multi-source data classification, delivering improved performance with optimized computational efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world multi-source remote sensing datasets demonstrate the superiority of MSFMamba outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. The source codes of MSFMamba are publicly available at https://github.com/oucailab/MSFMamba.</description>

      <title>RDEIC: Accelerating Diffusion-Based Extreme Image Compression with Relay Residual Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based extreme image compression methods have achieved impressive performance at extremely low bitrates. However, constrained by the iterative denoising process that starts from pure noise, these methods are limited in both fidelity and efficiency. To address these two issues, we present Relay Residual Diffusion Extreme Image Compression (RDEIC), which leverages compressed feature initialization and residual diffusion. Specifically, we first use the compressed latent features of the image with added noise, instead of pure noise, as the starting point to eliminate the unnecessary initial stages of the denoising process. Second, we directly derive a novel residual diffusion equation from Stable Diffusion's original diffusion equation that reconstructs the raw image by iteratively removing the added noise and the residual between the compressed and target latent features. In this way, we effectively combine the efficiency of residual diffusion with the powerful generative capability of Stable Diffusion. Third, we propose a fixed-step fine-tuning strategy to eliminate the discrepancy between the training and inference phases, thereby further improving the reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RDEIC achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and outperforms existing diffusion-based extreme image compression methods in both fidelity and efficiency.

Abstract: Improving breast cancer detection and monitoring techniques is a critical objective in healthcare, driving the need for innovative imaging technologies and diagnostic approaches. This study introduces a novel multi-tiered self-contrastive model tailored for microwave radiometry (MWR) in breast cancer detection. Our approach incorporates three distinct models: Local-MWR (L-MWR), Regional-MWR (R-MWR), and Global-MWR (G-MWR), designed to analyze varying sub-regional comparisons within the breasts. These models are integrated through the Joint-MWR (J-MWR) network, which leverages self-contrastive results at each analytical level to improve diagnostic accuracy. Utilizing a dataset of 4,932 female patients, our research demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed models. Notably, the J-MWR model achieves a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.74 $\pm$ 0.018, surpassing existing MWR neural networks and contrastive methods. These findings highlight the potential of self-contrastive learning techniques in improving the diagnostic accuracy and generalizability for MWR-based breast cancer detection. This advancement holds considerable promise for future investigations into enabling point-of-care testing.

Abstract: This paper introduces SpineFM, a novel pipeline that achieves state-of-the-art performance in the automatic segmentation and identification of vertebral bodies in cervical and lumbar spine radiographs. SpineFM leverages the regular geometry of the spine, employing a novel inductive process to sequentially infer the location of each vertebra along the spinal column. Vertebrae are segmented using Medical-SAM-Adaptor, a robust foundation model that diverges from commonly used CNN-based models. We achieved outstanding results on two publicly available spine X-Ray datasets, with successful identification of 97.8\% and 99.6\% of annotated vertebrae, respectively. Of which, our segmentation reached an average Dice of 0.942 and 0.921, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Image registration techniques usually assume that the images to be registered are of a certain type (e.g. single- vs. multi-modal, 2D vs. 3D, rigid vs. deformable) and there lacks a general method that can work for data under all conditions. We propose a registration method that utilizes neural networks for image representation. Our method uses untrained networks with limited representation capacity as an implicit prior to guide for a good registration. Unlike previous approaches that are specialized for specific data types, our method handles both rigid and non-rigid, as well as single- and multi-modal registration, without requiring changes to the model or objective function. We have performed a comprehensive evaluation study using a variety of datasets and demonstrated promising performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Brain Age Estimation with a Multimodal 3D CNN Approach Combining Structural MRI and AI-Synthesized Cerebral Blood Volume Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing global aging population necessitates improved methods to assess brain aging and its related neurodegenerative changes. Brain Age Gap Estimation (BrainAGE) offers a neuroimaging biomarker for understanding these changes by predicting brain age from MRI scans. Current approaches primarily use T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1w MRI) data, capturing only structural brain information. To address this limitation, AI-generated Cerebral Blood Volume (AICBV) data, synthesized from non-contrast MRI scans, offers functional insights by revealing subtle blood-tissue contrasts otherwise undetectable in standard imaging. We integrated AICBV with T1w MRI to predict brain age, combining both structural and functional metrics. We developed a deep learning model using a VGG-based architecture for both modalities and combined their predictions using linear regression. Our model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.95 years and an $R^2$ of 0.943 on the test set ($n = 288$), outperforming existing models trained on similar data. We have further created gradient-based class activation maps (Grad-CAM) to visualize the regions of the brain that most influenced the model's predictions, providing interpretable insights into the structural and functional contributors to brain aging.</description>

      <title>Gland Segmentation Using SAM With Cancer Grade as a Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14718</link>

Abstract: Cancer grade is a critical clinical criterion that can be used to determine the degree of cancer malignancy. Revealing the condition of the glands, a precise gland segmentation can assist in a more effective cancer grade classification. In machine learning, binary classification information about glands (i.e., benign and malignant) can be utilized as a prompt for gland segmentation and cancer grade classification. By incorporating prior knowledge of the benign or malignant classification of the gland, the model can anticipate the likely appearance of the target, leading to better segmentation performance. We utilize Segment Anything Model to solve the segmentation task, by taking advantage of its prompt function and applying appropriate modifications to the model structure and training strategies. We improve the results from fine-tuned Segment Anything Model and produce SOTA results using this approach.</description>

      <title>A Superposition Code-Based Semantic Communication Approach with Quantifiable and Controllable Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13980</link>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving security in semantic communication (SemCom) over a wiretap channel, where a legitimate receiver coexists with an eavesdropper experiencing a poorer channel condition. Despite previous efforts to secure SemCom against eavesdroppers, guarantee of approximately zero information leakage remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a secure digital semantic communication (SemCom) approach based on superposition codes, aiming to provide quantifiable and controllable security for digital SemCom systems. The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the eavesdropper' s reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping.</description>

      <title>DiffCom: Channel Received Signal is a Natural Condition to Guide Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional coding and transmission paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver's limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a blind posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.</description>
