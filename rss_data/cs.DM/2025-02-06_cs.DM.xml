      <title>The Labeled Coupon Collector Problem with Random Sample Sizes and Partial Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP) and present a novel generalized model, referred as the k-LCCP problem, where one is interested in recovering a bipartite graph with a perfect matching, which represents the coupons and their matching labels. We show two extra-extensions to this variation: the heterogeneous sample size case (K-LCCP) and the partly recovering case.</description>

      <title>Fault tolerance for metric dimension and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hernando et al. (2008) introduced the fault-tolerant metric dimension $\text{ftdim}(G)$, which is the size of the smallest resolving set $S$ of a graph $G$ such that $S-\left\{s\right\}$ is also a resolving set of $G$ for every $s \in S$. They found an upper bound $\text{ftdim}(G) \le \dim(G) (1+2 \cdot 5^{\dim(G)-1})$, where $\dim(G)$ denotes the standard metric dimension of $G$. It was unknown whether there exists a family of graphs where $\text{ftdim}(G)$ grows exponentially in terms of $\dim(G)$, until recently when Knor et al. (2024) found a family with $\text{ftdim}(G) = \dim(G)+2^{\dim(G)-1}$ for any possible value of $\dim(G)$. We improve the upper bound on fault-tolerant metric dimension by showing that $\text{ftdim}(G) \le \dim(G)(1+3^{\dim(G)-1})$ for every connected graph $G$. Moreover, we find an infinite family of connected graphs $J_k$ such that $\dim(J_k) = k$ and $\text{ftdim}(J_k) \ge 3^{k-1}-k-1$ for each positive integer $k$. Together, our results show that \[\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left( \max_{G: \text{ } \dim(G) = k} \frac{\log_3(\text{ftdim}(G))}{k} \right) = 1.\] In addition, we consider the fault-tolerant edge metric dimension $\text{ftedim}(G)$ and bound it with respect to the edge metric dimension $\text{edim}(G)$, showing that \[\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left( \max_{G: \text{ } \text{edim}(G) = k} \frac{\log_2(\text{ftedim}(G))}{k} \right) = 1.\] We also obtain sharp extremal bounds on fault-tolerance for adjacency dimension and $k$-truncated metric dimension. Furthermore, we obtain sharp bounds for some other extremal problems about metric dimension and its variants. In particular, we prove an equivalence between an extremal problem about edge metric dimension and an open problem of Erd\H{o}s and Kleitman (1974) in extremal set theory.</description>

      <title>Satisfying sequences for rainbow partite matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal F_1,\ldots, \mathcal F_s\subset [n]^k$ be a collection of $s$ families. In this paper, we address the following question: for which sequences $f_1,\ldots, f_s$ the conditions $|\ff_i|&gt;f_i$ imply that the families contain a rainbow matching, that is, there are pairwise disjoint $F_1\in \ff_1,\ldots F_s\in \ff_s$? We call such sequences {\em satisfying}. Kiselev and the first author verified the conjecture of Aharoni and Howard and showed that $f_1 = \ldots = f_s=(s-1)n^{k-1}$ is satisfying for $s&gt;470$. This is the best possible if the restriction is uniform over all families. However, it turns out that much more can be said about asymmetric restrictions. In this paper, we investigate this question in several regimes and in particular answer the questions asked by Kiselev and Kupavskii. We use a variety of methods, including concentration and anticoncentration results, spread approximations, and Combinatorial Nullstellenzats.</description>

      <title>The $\chi$-binding function of $d$-directional segment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a positive integer $d$, the class $d$-DIR is defined as all those intersection graphs formed from a finite collection of line segments in ${\mathbb R}^2$ having at most $d$ slopes. Since each slope induces an interval graph, it easily follows for every $G$ in $d$-DIR with clique number at most $\omega$ that the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of $G$ is at most $d\omega$. We show for every even value of $\omega$ how to construct a graph in $d$-DIR that meets this bound exactly. This partially confirms a conjecture of Bhattacharya, Dvo\v{r}\'ak and Noorizadeh. Furthermore, we show that the $\chi$-binding function of $d$-DIR is $\omega \mapsto d\omega$ for $\omega$ even and $\omega \mapsto d(\omega-1)+1$ for $\omega$ odd. This extends an earlier result by Kostochka and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, which treated the special case $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Discretely Beyond $1/e$: Guided Combinatorial Algorithms for Submodular Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For constrained, not necessarily monotone submodular maximization, all known approximation algorithms with ratio greater than $1/e$ require continuous ideas, such as queries to the multilinear extension of a submodular function and its gradient, which are typically expensive to simulate with the original set function. For combinatorial algorithms, the best known approximation ratios for both size and matroid constraint are obtained by a simple randomized greedy algorithm of Buchbinder et al. [9]: $1/e \approx 0.367$ for size constraint and $0.281$ for the matroid constraint in $\mathcal O (kn)$ queries, where $k$ is the rank of the matroid. In this work, we develop the first combinatorial algorithms to break the $1/e$ barrier: we obtain approximation ratio of $0.385$ in $\mathcal O (kn)$ queries to the submodular set function for size constraint, and $0.305$ for a general matroid constraint. These are achieved by guiding the randomized greedy algorithm with a fast local search algorithm. Further, we develop deterministic versions of these algorithms, maintaining the same ratio and asymptotic time complexity. Finally, we develop a deterministic, nearly linear time algorithm with ratio $0.377$.</description>

      <title>Orientable and negative orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>

      <title>The Polymatroid Representation of a Greedoid, and Associated Galois Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The greedoid is a significant abstraction of the matroid allowing for a more flexible analysis of structures in which the greedy algorithm "works." However, their diverse structure imposes difficulties towards their application in combinatorial optimization [Sze21]. In response, we revisit the polymatroid greedoid [KL85a] to characterize it by properties approximating those of matroids, by using the submodularity of its polymatroid representation in particular. Towards doing so, our main contribution is a full description of this class. Specifically, we show that a greedoid is a polymatroid greedoid if and only if it is an optimistic interval greedoid whose kernels are closed under intersection. This constitutes the first necessary and sufficient characterization of the polymatroid greedoid in terms of its combinatorial attributes, thereby resolving a central open question of Korte and Lov\'asz [KL85a]. Here, we introduce the optimism property to approximate properties of a matroid's continuations which are implied by the closure axioms of its span, which no longer hold for greedoids. And, because the kernels of an interval greedoid are in many ways an extension of a matroid's closed sets, our direction of necessity is a direct generalization of Birkhoff and Edmond's characterization of the meet in the lattice of a matroid's closed sets [Bir35, Edm03]. Towards achieving this result, our main technical insights arise from relating the lattice of flats of a polymatroid greedoid to that of the closed sets of its representation through order preserving mappings. Specifically, we will show the novel insight that the notion of polymatroid representation considered in [KL85a] is equivalent to the existence of a certain Galois connection. As a consequence, the representation of a greedoid via a polymatroid is an order theoretic concept in disguise.</description>
