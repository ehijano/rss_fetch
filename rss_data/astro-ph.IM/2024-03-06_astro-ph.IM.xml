      <title>Tuning neural posterior estimation for gravitational wave inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern simulation-based inference techniques use neural networks to solve inverse problems efficiently. One notable strategy is neural posterior estimation (NPE), wherein a neural network parameterizes a distribution to approximate the posterior. This approach is particularly advantageous for tackling low-latency or high-volume inverse problems. However, the accuracy of NPE varies significantly within the learned parameter space. This variability is observed even in seemingly straightforward systems like coupled-harmonic oscillators. This paper emphasizes the critical role of prior selection in ensuring the consistency of NPE outcomes. Our findings indicate a clear relationship between NPE performance across the parameter space and the number of similar samples trained on by the model. Thus, the prior should match the sample diversity across the parameter space to promote strong, uniform performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel procedure, in which amortized and sequential NPE are combined to swiftly refine NPE predictions for individual events. This method substantially improves sample efficiency, on average from nearly 0% to 10-80% within ten minutes. Notably, our research demonstrates its real-world applicability by achieving a significant milestone: accurate and swift inference of posterior distributions for low-mass binary black hole (BBH) events with NPE.</description>

      <title>Proposed high order harmonic interferometer for aperture synthesis radio telescope: Theory and computer simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new type of interferometer, called High Order Harmonic Interferometer (HOHI), was proposed by Wu (1996) for imaging by aperture synthesis radio telescope. Its feasibility was proven by theoretical analysis. Before putting HOHI in practical use, computer simulation is a necessary intermediate stage. In this paper the theoretical analysis is reviewed. Then, computer simulation, including its algorithm, calculation and generated maps, is presented. The theoretical analysis is validated by studying these maps.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Refinements to Metallicity-Dependent Isotopic Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The project aims to use machine learning algorithms to fit the free parameters of an isotopic scaling model to elemental observations. The processes considered are massive star nucleosynthesis, Type Ia SNe, the s-process, the r-process, and p-isotope production. The analysis on the successful fits seeks to minimize the reduced chi squared between the model and the data. Based upon the successful refinement of the isotopic parameterized scaling model, a table providing the 287 stable isotopic abundances as a function of metallicity, separated into astrophysical processes, is useful for identifying the chemical history of them. The table provides a complete averaged chemical history for the Galaxy, subject to the underlying model constraints.</description>

      <title>System performance of a TDM test-bed with long flex harness towards the new X-IFU FPA-DM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SRON (Netherlands Institute for Space Research) is developing the Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) for Athena X-IFU, whose Demonstration Model (DM) will use for the first time a time domain multiplexing (TDM)-based readout system for the on-board transition-edge sensors (TES). We report on the characterization activities on a TDM setup provided by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and tested in SRON cryogenic test facilities. The goal of these activities is to study the impact of the longer harness, closer to X-IFU specs, in a different EMI environment and switching from a single-ended to a differential readout scheme. In this contribution we describe the advancement in the debugging of the system in the SRON cryostat, which led to the demonstration of the nominal spectral performance of 2.8 eV at 5.9~keV with 16-row multiplexing, as well as an outlook for the future endeavours for the TDM readout integration on X-IFU's FPA-DM at SRON.</description>

      <title>Developments on frequency domain multiplexing readout for large arrays of transition-edge sensor X-ray micro-calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At SRON we have been developing X-ray TES micro-calorimeters as backup technology for the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) of the Athena mission, demonstrating excellent resolving powers both under DC and AC bias. We also developed a frequency-domain multiplexing (FDM) readout technology, where each TES is coupled to a superconducting band-pass LC resonator and AC biased at MHz frequencies through a common readout line. The TES signals are summed at the input of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which performs a first amplification at cryogenic stage. Custom analog front-end electronics and digital boards take care of further amplifying the signals at room temperature and of the modulation/demodulation of the TES signals and bias carrier, respectively. We report on the most recent developments on our FDM technology, which involves a two-channel demonstration with a total of 70 pixels with a summed energy resolution of 2.34 +/- 0.02 eV at 5.9 keV without spectral performance degradation with respect to single-channel operation. Moreover, we discuss prospects towards the scaling-up to a larger multiplexing factor up to 78 pixels per channel in a 1-6 MHz readout bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Scattering Networks for Identifying Radio Galaxy Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying the morphologies of radio galaxies is important to understand their physical properties and evolutionary histories. A galaxy's morphology is often determined by visual inspection, but as survey size increases robust automated techniques will be needed. Deep neural networks are an attractive method for automated classification, but have many free parameters and therefore require extensive training data and are subject to overfitting and generalization issues. We explore hybrid classification methods using the scattering transform, the recursive wavelet decomposition of an input image. We analyse the performance of the scattering transform for the Fanaroff-Riley classification of radio galaxies with respect to CNNs and other machine learning algorithms. We test the robustness of the different classification methods with training data truncation and noise injection, and find that the scattering transform can offer competitive performance with the most accurate CNNs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Time Delay Interferometry Ranging as a Practical Ranging Technique in the Bayesian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge on the inter-spacecraft optical paths (i.e. delays) is one of the key elements of time delay interferometry (TDI). Conventional method for inter-spacecraft ranging mainly relies on the pseudo-random noise (PRN) code signal modulated onto the lasers. To ensure the reliability and robustness of this ranging information, it would be highly beneficial to develop other methods which could serve as cross-validations or backups. This paper explores the practical implementation of an alternative data-driven approach - time delay interferometry ranging (TDIR) - as a ranging technique independent of the PRN signal. Distinguished from previous research, the inputs of our TDIR algorithm are interferometric measurements that have only undergone a 0.1 ms accuracy preliminary clock synchronization using the ground tracking data. This significantly relaxes the stringent requirement for clock synchronization imposed by traditional TDI procedure. In order to encode the information of time-varying light travel times and clock desynchronizations, we adopt a general polynomial parametrization to represent the delays. By framing TDIR as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem, we demonstrate our algorithm with simulated data based on the numerical orbit of Taiji. In the presence of laser frequency noise and secondary noises, the estimated median values of parameters exhibit a bias of only 5.28 ns from the ''true'' delays, capable of suppressing laser frequency noise to the desired level. Furthermore, we have also analysed the requirements of mitigating optical bench noise and clock noise on TDIR, and presented an illustrative example for the impact of laser locking.</description>

      <title>CLEAN algorithm implementation comparisons between popular software packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CLEAN algorithm, first published by H\"{o}gbom and its later variants such as Multiscale CLEAN (msCLEAN) by Cornwell, has been the most popular tool for deconvolution in radio astronomy. Interferometric imaging used in aperture synthesis radio telescopes requires deconvolution for removal of the telescopes point spread function from the observed images. We have compared source fluxes produced by different implementations of H\"{o}gbom and msCLEAN (WSCLEAN, CASA) with a prototype implementation of H\"{o}gbom and msCLEAN for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) on two datasets. First is a simulation of multiple point sources of known intensity using H\"{o}gbom, where none of the software packages detected all the simulated point sources to within 1.0% of the simulated values. The second is of supernova remnant G055.7+3.4 taken by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) using msCLEAN, where each of the software packages produced different images for the same settings.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud based on 20 years of OGLE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) can be used to probe the distribution and mass function of compact objects in the direction toward that galaxy - in the Milky Way disk, Milky Way dark matter halo, and the LMC itself. The previous measurements, based on small statistical samples of events, found that the optical depth is an order of magnitude smaller than that expected from the entire dark matter halo in the form of compact objects. However, these previous studies were not sensitive to long-duration events with Einstein timescales longer than 2.5-3 years, which are expected from massive ($10-100\,M_{\odot}$) and intermediate-mass ($10^2-10^5\,M_{\odot}$) black holes. Such events would have been missed by the previous studies and would not have been taken into account in calculations of the optical depth. Here, we present the analysis of nearly 20-year-long photometric monitoring of 78.7 million stars in the LMC by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 through 2020. We describe the observing setup, the construction of the 20-year OGLE dataset, the methods used for searching for microlensing events in the light curve data, and the calculation of the event detection efficiency. In total, we find 16 microlensing events (thirteen using an automated pipeline and three with manual searches), all of which have timescales shorter than 1 yr. We use a sample of thirteen events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC $\tau=(0.121 \pm 0.037)\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma=(0.74 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. These numbers are consistent with lensing by stars in the Milky Way disk and the LMC itself, and demonstrate that massive and intermediate-mass black holes cannot comprise a significant fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The TESS SPOC FFI Target Sample Explored with Gaia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TESS mission has provided the community with high-precision times series photometry for $\sim$2.8 million stars across the entire sky via the Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves produced by the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre (SPOC). This set of light curves is an extremely valuable resource for the discovery of transiting exoplanets and other stellar science. However, due to the sample selection, this set of light curves does not constitute a magnitude limited sample. In order to understand the effects of this sample selection, we use Gaia DR2 and DR3 to study the properties of the stars in the TESS-SPOC FFI light curve set, with the aim of providing vital context for further research using the sample. We report on the properties of the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets in Sectors 1 - 55 (covering Cycles 1 - 4). We cross-match the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets with the Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogues of all targets brighter than Gaia magnitude 14 to understand the effects of sample selection on the overall stellar properties. This includes Gaia magnitude, parallax, radius, temperature, non-single star flags, luminosity, radial velocity and stellar surface gravity. In total, there are $\sim$16.7 million Gaia targets brighter than G=14, which when cross-matched with the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets leaves $\sim$2.75 million. We investigate the binarity of each TESS-SPOC FFI Target and calculate the radius detection limit from two detected TESS transits which could be detected around each target. Finally, we create a comprehensive main sequence TESS-SPOC FFI Target sample which can be utilised in future studies.</description>

      <title>Improved modeling of in-ice particle showers for IceCube event reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory relies on an array of photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light produced by charged particles in the South Pole ice. IceCube data analyses depend on an in-depth characterization of the glacial ice, and on novel approaches in event reconstruction that utilize fast approximations of photoelectron yields. Here, a more accurate model is derived for event reconstruction that better captures our current knowledge of ice optical properties. When evaluated on a Monte Carlo simulation set, the median angular resolution for in-ice particle showers improves by over a factor of three compared to a reconstruction based on a simplified model of the ice. The most substantial improvement is obtained when including effects of birefringence due to the polycrystalline structure of the ice. When evaluated on data classified as particle showers in the high-energy starting events sample, a significantly improved description of the events is observed.</description>

      <title>Real-time portable muography with Hankuk Atmospheric-muon Wide Landscaping : HAWL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray muons prove valuable across various fields, from particle physics experiments to non-invasive tomography, thanks to their high flux and exceptional penetrating capability. Utilizing a scintillator detector, one can effectively study the topography of mountains situated above tunnels and underground spaces. The Hankuk Atmospheric-muon Wide Landscaping (HAWL) project successfully charts the mountainous region of eastern Korea by measuring cosmic ray muons with a detector in motion. The real-time muon flux measurement shows a tunnel length accuracy of 6.5 %, with a detectable overburden range spanning from 8 to 400 meter-water-equivalent depth. This is the first real-time portable muon tomography.</description>

      <title>On Cepheid distances in the $H_0$ measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids were the first stellar standard candles and have played a crucial role for astronomical distance measurements ever since the discovery of the Leavitt law (period-luminosity relation). Enormous improvements in distance accuracy have been achieved since Hertzsprung's first application of Leavitt's law to measure the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud in 1913, notably in very recent years thanks to a large data set of highly accurate space astrometry from the ESA mission Gaia. Complemented by homogeneous space photometry, Cepheids enable the most accurate distance estimates to galaxies hosting type-Ia supernovae up to approximately 70 Mpc distant. Here, I review the history of Cepheid distance measurements, open questions on the side of stellar astrophysics, and recent studies seeking to quantify and mitigate systematics with a view to further improve the accuracy on the Hubble constant. For example, the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will enhance precision due to 4x lower sensitivity to source blending in crowded regions and greater sensitivity in dust-insensitive infrared bands. Future 30m-class telescopes could in principle further improve Cepheid distance measurements towards the Hubble flow, if technical challenges related to a continuously evolving instrument can be overcome.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Surveying the distant Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the most active period of star formation in galaxies, which occurs in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;3, strong bursts of star formation result in significant quantities of dust, which obscures new stars being formed as their UV/optical light is absorbed and then re-emitted in the infrared, which redshifts into the mm/sub-mm bands for these early times. To get a complete picture of the high-z galaxy population, we need to survey a large patch of the sky in the sub-mm with sufficient angular resolution to resolve all galaxies, but we also need the depth to fully sample their cosmic evolution, and therefore obtain their redshifts using direct mm spectroscopy with a very wide frequency coverage. This requires a large single-dish sub-mm telescope with fast mapping speeds at high sensitivity and angular resolution, a large bandwidth with good spectral resolution and multiplex spectroscopic capabilities. The proposed 50-m Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) will deliver these specifications. We discuss how AtLAST allows us to study the whole population of high-z galaxies, including the dusty star-forming ones which can only be detected and studied in the sub-mm, and obtain a wealth of information for each of these up to z~7: gas content, cooling budget, star formation rate, dust mass, and dust temperature. We present worked examples of surveys that AtLAST can perform, both deep and wide, and also focused on galaxies in proto-clusters. In addition we show how such surveys with AtLAST can measure the growth rate and the Hubble constant with high accuracy, and demonstrate the power of the line-intensity mapping method in the mm/sub-mm wavebands to constrain the cosmic expansion history at high redshifts, as good examples of what can uniquely be done by AtLAST in this research field.</description>

      <title>Targeted optimization in small-scale atomic structure calculations: application to Au I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of reliable atomic data can be a severe limitation in astrophysical modelling, in particular of events such as kilonovae that require information on all neutron-capture elements across a wide range of ionization stages. Notably, the presence of non-orthonormalities between electron orbitals representing configurations that are close in energy can introduce significant inaccuracies in computed energies and transition probabilities. Here, we propose an explicit targeted optimization method that can effectively circumvent this concern while retaining an orthonormal orbital basis set. We illustrate this method within the framework of small-scale atomic structure models of Au I, using the GRASP2018 multiconfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock atomic structure code. By comparing to conventional optimization schemes we show how a targeted optimization approach improves the energy level positioning and ordering. Targeted optimization also leads to better agreement with experimental data for the strongest E1 transitions. This illustrates how small-scale models can be significantly improved with minor computational costs if orbital non-orthonormalities are considered carefully. These results should prove useful to multi-element atomic structure calculations in, for example, astrophysical opacity applications involving neutron-capture elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The addition of individual quanta of rotational excitation to a molecule has been shown to markedly change its reactivity by significantly modifying the intermolecular interactions. So far, it has only been possible to observe these rotational effects in a very limited number of systems due to lack of rotational selectivity in chemical reaction experiments. The recent development of rotationally controlled molecular beams now makes such investigations possible for a wide range of systems. This is particularly crucial in order to understand the chemistry occurring in the interstellar medium, such as exploring the formation of carbon-based astrochemical molecules and the emergence of molecular complexity in interstellar space from the reaction of small atomic and molecular fragments.</description>

      <title>Assessing the similarity of continuous gravitational-wave signals to narrow instrumental artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs) are long-lasting quasi-monochromatic gravitational-wave signals expected to be emitted by rapidly-rotating non-axisymmetric neutron stars. Depending on the rotational frequency and sky location of the source, certain CW signals may behave in a similar manner to narrow-band artifacts present in ground-based interferometric detectors. Part of the detector-characterisation tasks in the current generation of interferometric detectors (Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA) aim at understanding the origin of these narrow artifacts, commonly known as ``spectral lines''. It is expected that similar tasks will continue after the arrival of next-generation detectors (e.g. Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer). Typically, a fraction of the observed lines in a given detector can be associated to one or more instrumental causes; others, however, have an unknown origin. In this work, we assess the similarity of CW signals to spectral lines in order to understand whether a CW may be mistaken for a noise artifact. Albeit astrophysically unlikely, our results do not rule out the possibility of a CW signal being visible in the detector's power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Jovian sodium nebula and Io plasma torus S$^+$ and brightnesses 2017 -- 2023: insights into volcanic vs. sublimation supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present first results derived from the largest collection of contemporaneously recorded Jovian sodium nebula and Io plasma torus (IPT) in [S II] 673.1 nm images assembled to date. The data were recorded by the Planetary Science Institute's Io Input/Output observatory (IoIO) and provide important context to Io geologic and atmospheric studies as well as the Juno mission and supporting observations. Enhancements in the observed emission are common, typically lasting 1 -- 3 months, such that the average flux of material from Io is determined by the enhancements, not any quiescent state. The enhancements are not seen at periodicities associated with modulation in solar insolation of Io's surface, thus physical process(es) other than insolation-driven sublimation must ultimately drive the bulk of Io's atmospheric escape. We suggest that geologic activity, likely involving volcanic plumes, drives escape.</description>

      <title>How much information can be extracted from galaxy clustering at the field level?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optimal Bayesian field-level cosmological constraints from nonlinear tracers of the large-scale structure, specifically the amplitude $\sigma_8$ of linear matter fluctuations inferred from rest-frame simulated dark matter halos in a comoving volume of $8\,(h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc})^3$. Our constraint on $\sigma_8$ is entirely due to nonlinear information, and obtained by explicitly sampling the initial conditions along with bias and noise parameters via a Lagrangian EFT-based forward model, LEFTfield. The comparison with a simulation-based inference analysis employing the power spectrum and bispectrum likewise using the LEFTfield forward model shows that, when including precisely the same modes of the same data up to $k_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.12\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), the field-level approach yields a factor of 1.7 (2.6) improvement on the $\sigma_8$ constraint, from 9.9% to 5.8% (9.4% to 3.6%). This study provides the first direct insights into cosmological information encoded in galaxy clustering beyond low-order $n$-point functions.</description>

Abstract: Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for INfrared Exploration (JASMINE) is a planned M-class science space mission by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. JASMINE has two main science goals. One is the Galactic archaeology with Galactic Center Survey, which aims to reveal the Milky Way's central core structure and formation history from Gaia-level (~25 $\mu$as) astrometry in the Near-Infrared (NIR) Hw-band (1.0-1.6 $\mu$m). The other is the Exoplanet Survey, which aims to discover transiting Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone from NIR time-series photometry of M dwarfs when the Galactic center is not accessible. We introduce the mission, review many science objectives, and present the instrument concept. JASMINE will be the first dedicated NIR astrometry space mission and provide precise astrometric information of the stars in the Galactic center, taking advantage of the significantly lower extinction in the NIR. The precise astrometry is obtained by taking many short-exposure images. Hence, the JASMINE Galactic center survey data will be valuable for studies of exoplanet transits, asteroseismology, variable stars and microlensing studies, including discovery of (intermediate mass) black holes. We highlight a swath of such potential science, and also describe synergies with other missions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of High-polarization Stars and Blazars with DIPOL-1 at Sierra Nevada Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report here the performance and first results of the new multiband optical polarimeter DIPOL-1, installed at the Sierra Nevada Observatory 90 cm T90 telescope (SNO, Granada, Spain). DIPOL-1 is equipped with a plane parallel calcite plate and $\lambda$/2 retarder for modulating the intensity of two perpendicularly polarized beams, and a high readout speed CMOS camera that allows for fast, time-dense coverage. We characterize the performance of this instrument through a series of tests on zero- and high-polarization standard stars. The instrumental polarization in the Nasmyth focus was well determined, with a very stable contribution of 4.0806% $\pm$ 0.0014% in the optical $R$ band. For bright high-polarization standards ($m_{R}&lt;8$) we reach precisions $&lt;$0.02% in polarization degree and 0.1$^{\circ}$ in polarization angle for exposures of 2$-$4 minutes. The polarization properties of these stars have been constrained, providing more recent results also about possible variability for future studies on some of the most used calibrators. Moreover, we have tested the capability of observing much fainter objects, in particular through blazar observations, where we reach a precision $&lt;$0.5$-$0.6% and $&lt;$0.5$^{\circ}$ for faint targets ($m_{R}\sim16.5$) with exposures of $\sim$1 hour. For brighter targets ($m_{R}\sim14.5-15$), we can aim for time-dense observations with errors $&lt;$$0.2-0.4$% and $&lt;$$1-1.5^{\circ}$ in 5-20 minutes. We have successfully performed a first campaign with DIPOL-1, detecting significant polarized emission of several blazars, with special attention to the highest ever polarization degree measured from blazar 3C~345 at $\sim$32%.</description>
