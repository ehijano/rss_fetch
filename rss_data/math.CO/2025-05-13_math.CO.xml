      <title>On Unique Neighborhoods in Bipartite and Expander Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An undirected graph is said to have \emph{unique neighborhoods} if any two distinct nodes have also distinct sets of neighbors. In this way, the connections of a node to other nodes can characterize a node like an "identity", irrespectively of how nodes are named, as long as two nodes are distinguishable. We study the uniqueness of neighborhoods in (random) bipartite graphs, and expander graphs.</description>

      <title>Mixing and Merging Metric Spaces using Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X_1,d_1),\dots, (X_N,d_N)$ be metric spaces with respective distance functions $d_i: X_i \times X_i \rightarrow [0,1]$, $i=1,\dots,N$. Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the set theoretic product $X_1\times \cdots \times X_N$ and let $\mathbf{g} \in \mathcal{X}$ and $\mathbf{h} \in \mathcal{X}$ denote two elements in this product space. Let $\mathcal{G} = \left(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}\right)$ be a directed graph with vertices $\mathcal{V} =\{1,\dots, N\}$ and with a positive weight $\mathcal{P} = \{p_{ij}\}, p_{ij}\in (0, 1], i,j = 1,..,N$ associated with each edge $(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}$ of $\mathcal{G}$. We define the function \begin{align*} d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}) := \left(1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \prod_{i=1}^N \left[1- d_i(g_i,h_i)\right]^{\frac{1}{p_{ji}}} \right). \end{align*} In this paper we show that $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defines a metric space over $\mathcal{X}$ and we investigate the properties of this distance under graph operations, which includes disjoint unions and cartesian products. We show two limiting cases: (a) where $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defined over a finite field leads to a broad generalization of graph-based distances that is widely studied in the theory of error-correcting codes; and (b) where $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ is extended to measuring distances over graphons.</description>

      <title>On independence complexes of graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the independence complex for graph products where at least one of the factors is a path as well as the complexes for their induced subgraphs. We calculate the homotopy type of the independence complex of the graphs $P_n\times P_m$, $P_n\boxtimes P_2$, $P_n\boxtimes P_3$ and $P_n\boxtimes P_4$. We also focus in the independence complexes of the induced subgraphs of $P_n\times P_3$, $P_n\boxtimes P_2$, $P_n\boxtimes P_3$, $P_n\boxtimes P_4$ and some lexicographic products.</description>

      <title>Components of Flip Graph of Triangulated S^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (\mathcal{F}(n)) be the graph of (n)-vertex triangulations of the 3-sphere (S^3), with edges as bistellar 2--3 and 3--2 moves. Pachner's theorem \cite{P91} shows the flip graph is connected with 1--4 and 4--1 moves, but (\mathcal{F}(n)) loses connectivity: it is connected for (5 \leq n \leq 9) ((n=5) minimal for (S^3)) but splits into multiple components at (n=16), (n=20), (n=21), and likely beyond. The polytopal closure of (\mathcal{F}(n)) is the component with all boundary complexes of convex 4-polytopes. We prove (\mathcal{F}(10)) and (\mathcal{F}(11)) are connected by showing: every non-polytopal 10-vertex seed triangulation (no 3--2 flips) is one 2--3 flip from a convex-polytope boundary, and every 11-vertex seed triangulation arises from a 10-vertex convex polytope via a 1--4 flip and 2--3 or 3--2 flips, both in the polytopal closure. We address four unflippable (S^3) complexes ((U(16)), (U(20)), (U_1(21)), (U_2(21))), showing each connects to the polytopal closure of (\mathcal{F}(n+1)) after one 1--4 vertex insertion and an annealing process maximizing removable-vertex chains. We propose the Weeping Willow Conjecture: non-polytopal components of (\mathcal{F}(n)) stem from the polytopal closure of (\mathcal{F}(m)), (m &gt; n), via 4--1 moves, with the polytopal closure as the trunk and other components as branches.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Symmetric Function for Unicyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of which structural properties of a graph can be recovered from the chromatic symmetric function (CSF), we study the CSF of connected unicyclic graphs. While it is known that there can be non-isomorphic unicyclic graphs with the same CSF, we find experimentally that such examples are rare for graphs with up to 17 vertices. In fact, in many cases we can recover data such as the number of leaves, number of internal edges, cycle size, and number of attached non-trivial trees, by extending known results for trees to unicyclic graphs. These results are obtained by analyzing the CSF of a connected unicyclic graph in the $\textit{star-basis}$ using the deletion-near-contraction (DNC) relation developed by Aliste-Prieto, Orellana and Zamora, and computing the "leading" partition, its coefficient, as well as coefficients indexed by hook partitions. We also give explicit formulas for star-expansions of several classes of graphs, developing methods for extracting coefficients using structural properties of the graph.</description>

      <title>Coarse Balanced Separators and Tree-Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Robertson and Seymour (1986) states that the treewidth of a graph is linearly tied to its separation number: the smallest integer $k$ such that, for every weighting of the vertices, the graph admits a balanced separator of size at most $k$. Motivated by recent progress on coarse treewidth, Abrishami, Czy\.{z}ewska, Kluk, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\k{a}\.{z}ewski (2025) conjectured a coarse analogue to this result: every graph that has a balanced separator consisting of a bounded number of balls of bounded radius is quasi-isometric to a graph with bounded treewidth. In this paper, we confirm their conjecture for $K_{t,t}$-induced-subgraph-free graphs when the separator consists of a bounded number of balls of radius $1$. In doing so, we bridge two important conjectures concerning the structure of graphs that exclude a planar graph as an induced minor.</description>

      <title>Generalised Erd\H{o}s distance theory on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Erd\H{o}s distinct distances problem asks the following: how many distinct distances must exist between a set of $n$ points in the plane? There are many generalisations of this question that ask one to consider different spaces and metrics, or larger structures of points. We bring these problems into a common framework using the concept of $g$-rigidity. Specifically, if $G=(V,E)$ is a (hyper)graph, $g$ is a map assigning polynomial measurements to the edges of $G$ and $f_{g,G}(P^V)$ gives the set of $g$-distinct realisations of the $g$-rigid graph $G$, where vertices must lie in a point set $P$, our main results describe sharp lower bounds for the size of $\big|f_{g,G}(P^V)\big|$. This allows us to obtain results for pseudo-Euclidean metrics, $\ell_p$ metrics, dot-product problems, matrix completion problems, and symmetric tensor completion problems.
  In addition, we use the recent work of Alon, Buci\'c and Sauermann along with a simple colouring argument to prove that the number of $\| \cdot\|$-distinct realisations of a graph $G=(V,E)$ within a $d$-dimensional point set $P$ is at least $\Omega\left(\frac{|P|^{|V|-1}}{(\log |P|)^2} \right)$ for almost all $d$-norms. Our methods here also provide a short proof that the unit distance conjecture implies the pinned distance conjecture.</description>

      <title>Chordality and Shellability of Higher Independence Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $r$-independence complex $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ and its associated hypergraph $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ from combinatorial and algebraic perspectives. We demonstrate that contrary to previous claims, $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ need not be chordal even when $G$ is a tree, providing explicit counterexamples. Our results establish precise conditions for chordality across several graph classes: for cycles $C_n$, $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ is chordal exactly when $n-2 \leq r \leq n-1$; for forests, chordality holds when $r \geq n-5$; and for block graphs, $\mathcal{C}_2(G)$ is always chordal. Furthermore, we show that $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ remains chordal for all $r \geq 2$ in graphs with diameter constraints. The shellability of $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ is proved through three fundamental constructions: star-clique attachments to vertex covers, generalized whiskering operations that preserve shellability under size constraints, and cyclic clique arrangements where shellability depends critically on attachment sizes. These results collectively generalize existing work on shellable independence complexes to the broader setting of higher independence complexes, revealing new connections between graph structure, hypergraph chordality, and algebraic properties of associated ideals.</description>

      <title>Invariants and areas of Steiner 4-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the invariants of Steiner chains consisting of four circles. In particular, we compute the invariant moments of curvatures in Steiner 4-chains and give two applications of the obtained formulas. Specifically, we present an algorithmic feasibility criterion for Steiner 4-chains and identify the poristic Steiner chains having extremal areas, which yields a generalisation of the main results of a recent paper by K.Kiradjiev. The proofs are based on the invariants of Steiner chains described by R.Schwarz and S.Tabachnikov and on the relations between the radii of neighbouring poristic circles established by P.Yiu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the category of graded Hopf algebras that are free noncommutative, cocommutative, graded and connected from the perspective of the sequences of dimensions of the graded pieces. We show that a Hopf algebra exists with a given sequence of graded dimensions if and only if the ``INVERTi'' transformation of the sequence is nonnegative. We give conditions on the sequences of graded dimensions for two Hopf algebras $H$ and $K$ in this category under which there exists a surjective homomorphism from $H$ to $K$. We also give conditions such that an isomorphic copy of $H$ occurs as a Hopf subalgebra of $K$.</description>

      <title>Three-edge-coloring (Tait coloring) cubic graphs on the torus: A proof of Gr\"unbaum's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graph that can be embedded in the torus, with the exceptional graph class called "Petersen-like", is 3-edge-colorable. This means every (non-trivial) toroidal snark can be obtained from several copies of the Petersen graph using the dot product operation. The first two snarks in this family are the Petersen graph and one of Blanu\v{s}a snarks; the rest are exposed by Vodopivec in 2008. This proves a strengthening of the well-known, long-standing conjecture of Gr\"unbaum from 1968.
  This implies that a 2-connected cubic (multi)graph that can be embedded in the torus is not 3-edge-colorable if and only if it can be obtained from a dot product of copies of the Petersen graph by replacing its vertices with 2-edge-connected planar cubic (multi)graphs. Here, replacing a vertex $v$ in a cubic graph $G$ is the operation that takes a 2-connected planar cubic multigraph $H$ and one of its vertices $u$ of degree 3, unifying $G-v$ and $H-u$ and connecting the neighbors of $v$ in $G-v$ with the neighbors of $u$ in $H-u$ with a matching.
  This result is a highly nontrivial generalization of the Four Color Theorem, and its proof requires a combination of extensive computer verification and computer-free extension of existing proofs on colorability.
  An important consequence of this result is a very strong version of the Tutte 4-Flow Conjecture for toroidal graphs. We show that a 2-edge connected graph embedded in the torus admits a nowhere-zero 4-flow unless it is Petersen-like (in which case it does not admit nowhere-zero 4-flows). Observe that this is a vast strengthening over the Tutte 4-Flow Conjecture on the torus, which assumes that the graph does not contain the Petersen graph as a minor because almost all toroidal graphs contain the Petersen graph minor, but almost none are Petersen-like.</description>

      <title>Local rainbow colorings of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the concepts related to rainbow coloring to hypergraphs. Specifically, an $(n,r,H)$-local coloring is defined as a collection of $n$ edge-colorings, $f_v: E(K^{(r)}_n) \rightarrow [k]$ for each vertex $v$ in the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph $K^{(r)}_n$, with the property that for any copy $T$ of $H$ in $K^{(r)}_n$, there exists at least one vertex $u$ in $T$ such that $f_u$ provides a rainbow edge-coloring of $T$ (i.e., no two edges in $T$ share the same color under $f_u$). The minimum number of colors required for this coloring is denoted as the local rainbow coloring number $C_r(n, H)$.
  We first establish an upper bound of the local rainbow coloring number for $r$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ consisting of $h$ vertices, that is, $C_r(n, H)= O\left( n^{\frac{h-r}{h}} \cdot h^{2r + \frac{r}{h}} \right)$. Furthermore, we identify a set of $r$-uniform hypergraphs whose local rainbow coloring numbers are bounded by a constant. A notable special case indicates that $C_3(n,H) \leq C(H)$ for some constant $C(H)$ depending only on $H$ if and only if $H$ contains at most 3 edges and does not belong to a specific set of three well-structured hypergraphs, possibly augmented with isolated vertices. We further establish two 3-uniform hypergraphs $H$ of particular interest for which $C_3(n,H) = n^{o(1)}$.
  Regarding lower bounds, we demonstrate that for every $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with sufficiently many edges, there exists a constant $b = b(H) &gt; 0$ such that $C_r(n,H) = \Omega(n^b)$. Additionally, we obtain lower bounds for several hypergraphs of specific interest.</description>

      <title>Some Observations about the "Generalized Abundancy Index"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}(\ell,n) \subset S_n^{\ell}$ denote the set of all $\ell$-tuples $(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell})$, for $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell} \in S_n$ satisfying: $\forall i&lt;j$ we have $\pi_i\pi_j=\pi_j\pi_i$. Considering the action of $S_n$ on $[n]=\{1,\dots,n\}$, let $\kappa(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell})$ be equal to the number of orbits of the action of the subgroup $\langle \pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell} \rangle \subset S_n$. There has been interest in the study of the combinatorial numbers $A(\ell,n,k)$ equal to the cardinalities $|\{(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell}) \in \mathcal{A}(\ell,n)\, :\, \kappa(\pi_1,\dots\pi_{\ell})=k\}|$. If one defines $B(\ell,n)=A(\ell,n,1)/(n-1)!$, then it is known that $B(\ell,n) = \sum_{(f_1,\dots,f_{\ell}) \in \mathbb{N}^{\ell}} \mathbf{1}_{\{n\}}(f_1\cdots f_{\ell}) \prod_{r=1}^{\ell-1} f_r^{\ell-r}$. A special case, $\ell=2$, is $B(2,n) = \sum_{d|n} d = \sigma_1(n)$ the sum-of-divisors function. Then $A(2,n,1)/n!=B(2,n)/n$ is called the abundancy index: $\sigma_1(n)/n$. We call $B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ the ``generalized abundancy index.'' Building on work of Abdesselam, using the probability model, we prove that $\lim_{N \to \infty} N^{-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N} B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ equals $\zeta(2)\cdots \zeta(\ell)$. Motivated by this we state a more precise conjecture for the asymptotics of $-\zeta(2) + N^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^{N} (B(2,n)/n)$.</description>

      <title>Equicovering masses in the Euclidean plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic mass partition results are about dividing the plane into regions that are equal with respect to one or more measures (masses). We introduce a new concept in which the notion of partition is replaced by that of a cover. In this case we require (almost) every point in the plane to be covered the same number of times. If all elements of this cover are equal with respect to the given masses, we refer to them as equicoverings.
  To construct equicoverings, we study a natural generalization of $k$-fan partitions, which we call spiral equicoverings. Like $k$-fans, these consist of wedges centered at a common point, but arranged in a way that allows overlapping. Our main result nearly characterizes all reduced positive rational numbers $p/q$ for which there exists a covering by $q$ convex wedges such that every point is covered exactly $p$ times. The proofs use results about centerpoints and combine tools from classical mass partition results, and elementary number theory.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Higher Specht Polynomials and Decompositions of Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: %We show how to normalize the higher Specht polynomials of Ariki, Terasoma, and Yamada in a compatible way in order to define a stable version of these polynomials. We also decompose the non-transitive actions of Haglund, Rhoades, and Shimozono into orbits, and show how the associated basis of higher Specht polynomials of Gillespie and Rhoades respects that decomposition. For a given $n$, the orbits of the action of $S_{n}$ are associated with subsets of the set of positive integers that are smaller than $n$, and we relate the representation associated with a set $I$ to the ones of $S_{n+1}$ associated with $I$ and with its union with $n$, the latter being a lifting of the Branching Rule.</description>

      <title>Generalized Higher Specht Polynomials and Homogeneous Representations of Symmetric Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider actions, similar to those of Haglund, Rhoades, and Shimozono on ordered partitions, and their basis in terms of the higher Specht polynomials of Ariki, Terasoma, and Yamada, as carried out by Gillespie and Rhoades. By allowing empty sets and working with multi-sets and weak partitions as indices, we obtain a decomposition of the action of $S_{n}$ on homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ into irreducible representations, in a way that lifts a formula of Stanley. By considering generalized higher Specht polynomials, we obtain yet another such decomposition, lifting another formula involving Kostka numbers. We also investigate several operations on both types of representations, which are based on normalizations of the generalized higher Specht polynomials that allow for defining their stable versions.</description>

      <title>Further results on latin squares with disjoint subsquares using rational outline squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of finding latin squares with sets of pairwise disjoint subsquares. We develop a new necessary condition on the sizes of the subsquares which incorporates and extends the known conditions. We provide a construction for the case where all but two of the subsquares are the same size, and in this case the condition is sufficient. We obtain these results using symmetric rational outline squares, and additionally provide several new results and extensions to this theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices, independence number $\alpha(G)$ and Lov\'{a}sz theta function $\vartheta(G)$. We define $n_{\ge0}(G)$ to be the minimum number of non-negative eigenvalues taken over all Hermitian weighted adjacency matrices of $G$. It is well known that $\alpha(G) \le \vartheta(G)$ and $\alpha(G) \le n_{\ge0}(G)$. We also let $n_{\ge0}(A_G)$ denote the number of non-negative eigenvalues of the unweighted adjacency matrix of $G$.
  Continuing a long line of works, we investigate the relationships between $ \alpha(G) $, $ \vartheta(G) $, and $ n_{\ge 0}(G) $. We prove a conjecture of Kwan and Wigderson, showing that for every integer $ k $, there exists a graph $ G $ with $ \alpha(G) \leq 2 $ and $ n_{\ge 0}(G) \ge k $. Our proof relies on a new observation: if the complement of $G$ contains a good spectral expander, then $n_{\geq 0}(G)$ must be large.
  We also show that $ \vartheta(G) $ can be exponentially larger than $ n_{\ge 0}(G) $, improving a recent result of Ihringer. Finally, we revisit a Nordhaus--Gaddum type bound for $ n_{\ge 0}(A_G) $ due to Elphick and Wocjan, and conjecture that $ n_{\ge 0}(A_G) \cdot n_{\ge 0}(A_{\overline{G}}) \ge n $ holds for all graphs.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Polynomial Inequalities in Subset Densities and Additive Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many results in extremal graph theory can be formulated as certain polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. Answering fundamental questions raised by Lov{\'a}sz, Szegedy and Razborov, Hatami and Norine proved that determining the validity of an arbitrary such polynomial inequality in graph homomorphism densities is undecidable. We observe that many results in additive combinatorics can also be formulated as polynomial inequalities in subset's density and its variants. Based on techniques introduced in Hatami and Norine, together with algebraic and graph construction and Fourier analysis, we prove similarly two theorems of undecidability, thus showing that establishing such polynomial inequalities in additive combinatorics are inherently difficult in their full generality.</description>

      <title>Extended inverse results for restricted h-fold sumset in integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite set of $k$ integers. For $h \leq k$, the restricted $h$-fold sumset $h^{\wedge} A$ is the set of all sums of $h$ distinct elements of $A$. In additive combinatorics, much of the focus has traditionally been on finite integer sets whose sumsets are unusually small (cf.\ Freiman's theorem and its extensions). More recently, Nathanson posed the inverse problem for the restricted sumset $h^{\wedge} A$ when $|h^{\wedge} A|$ is small. For $h \in \{2, 3, 4\}$, this question has already been studied by Mohan and Pandey. In this article, we study the inverse problems for $h^{\wedge} A$ with arbitrary $h \geq 3$ and characterize all possible sets $A$ for certain cardinalities of $h^{\wedge} A$.</description>

      <title>On core of categorical product of (di)graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core of a graph is the smallest graph (in terms of number of vertices) to which it is homomorphically equivalent.
  The question of the possible order of the core of the tensor product (also known as categorical, Heidetnemi or direct product) of two graphs captures some well known problems. For instance, the recent counterexample to the Hedetniemi conjecture for 5-chromatic graphs is equivalent to saying that there are cores of order at least 5 whose product has a core of order 4.
  In this work, motivated by a question from Leonid Libkin in the area of graph databases, we first present methods of building cores whose categorical product is also a core. Extending on this we present sufficient conditions for a set of cores to have a product which is also a core. Presenting an example of such a family of digraphs, we construct a family of $\binom{2n}{n}$ digraphs, where the number of vertices of each is between $n^2+5n+2$ and $3n^2+3n+2$ and the product is a core. We then present a method of transforming the example into a family of graphs.</description>

      <title>Extremal Cat Herding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of Cat Herding is one in which cat and herder players alternate turns, with the evasive cat moving along non-trivial paths between vertices, and the herder deleting single edges from the graph. Eventually the cat cannot move, and the number of edges deleted is the cat number of the graph. We analyze both when the cat is captured quickly, and when the cat evades capture forever, or for an arbitrarily long time. We develop a reduction construction that retains the cat number of the graph, and classify all (reduced) graphs that have cat number 3 or less as a finite set of graphs. We expand on a logical characterization of infinite Cat Herding on trees to describe all infinite graphs on which the cat can evade capture forever. We also provide a brief characterization of the graphs on which the cat can score arbitrarily high. We conclude by motivating a definition of cat herding ordinals for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a combinatorial question about searching for an unknown ideal $\mu$ within a known pointed poset $\lambda$. Elements of $\lambda$ may be queried for membership in $\mu$, but at most $k$ positive queries are permitted. We provide a general search strategy for this problem, and establish new bounds (based on $k$ and the degree and height of $\lambda$) for the total number of queries required to identify $\mu$. We show that this strategy performs asymptotically optimally on the family of complete $\ell$-ary trees as the height grows.</description>

      <title>Order polytopes of graded posets are gamma-effective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order polytopes of posets have been a very rich topic at the crossroads between combinatorics and discrete geometry since their definition by Stanley in 1986. Among other notable results, order polytopes of graded posets are known to be $\gamma$-nonnegative by work of Br\"and\'en, who introduced the concept of sign-graded poset in the process.
  In the present paper we are interested in proving an equivariant version of Br\"and\'en's result, using the tools of equivariant Ehrhart theory (introduced by Stapledon in 2011). Namely, we prove that order polytopes of graded posets are always $\gamma$-effective, i.e., that the $\gamma$-polynomial associated with the equivariant $h^*$-polynomial of the order polytope of any graded poset has coefficients consisting of actual characters. To reach this goal, we develop a theory of order polytopes of sign-graded posets, and find a formula to express the numerator of the equivariant Ehrhart series of such an object in terms of the saturations (\`a la Br\"and\'en) of the given sign-graded poset.</description>

      <title>On the Sumset of Sets of Size $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbb{Z}}(h,k)$ consists of all possible sizes for the $h$-fold sumset of sets containing $k$ integers. The exact makeup of this set is still unknown, but there has been progress towards determining which integers are present. We know that $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbb{Z}}(h,k)\subseteq\left[hk-h+1,\binom{h+k-1}{h}\right]$, where the right side is an interval of integers that includes the endpoints. These endpoints are known to be attained. We will prove that the integers in $\left[hk-h+2,hk-1\right]$ are not possible sizes for the $h$-fold sumset of a set containing $k\geq 4$ integers. Furthermore, we will confirm that this interval can't be made larger by exhibiting a set whose $h$-fold sumset has size $hk$.</description>

      <title>The generalized trifference problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding the largest number $T(n, m)$ of ternary vectors of length $n$ such that for any three distinct vectors there are at least $m$ coordinates where they pairwise differ.
  For $m = 1$, this is the classical trifference problem which is wide open.
  We prove upper and lower bounds on $T(n, m)$ for various ranges of the parameter $m$ and determine the phase transition threshold on $m=m(n)$ where $T(n, m)$ jumps from constant to exponential in $n$.
  By relating the linear version of this problem to a problem on blocking sets in finite geometry, we give explicit constructions and probabilistic lower bounds.
  We also compute the exact values of this function and its linear variation for small parameters.</description>

      <title>Odd clique minors in graphs with independence number two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $K_t$-expansion consists of $t$ vertex-disjoint trees, every two of which are joined by an edge. We call such an expansion odd if its vertices can be two-colored so that the edges of the trees are bichromatic but the edges between trees are monochromatic. A graph contains an odd $K_t$ minor or an odd clique minor of order $t$ if it contains an odd $K_t$-expansion. Gerards and Seymour from 1995 conjectured that every graph $G$ contains an odd $K_{\chi(G)}$ minor, where $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$. This conjecture is referred to as ``Odd Hadwiger's Conjecture". Let $\alpha(G)$ denote the independence number of a graph $G$. In this paper we investigate the Odd Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs $G$ with $\alpha(G)\le2$. We first observe that a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\alpha(G)\le2$ contains an odd $K_{\chi(G)}$ minor if and only if $G$ contains an odd clique minor of order $\lceil n/2\rceil$. We then prove that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\alpha(G)\le 2$ contains an odd clique minor of order $\lceil n/2\rceil$ if $G$ contains a clique of order $n/4$ when $n$ is even and $(n+3)/4$ when $n$ is odd, or $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph, where $\alpha(H)\le 2$ and $H$ is an induced subgraph of $K_1 + P_4$, $K_2+(K_1\cup K_3)$, $K_1+(K_1\cup K_4)$, $K_7^-$, $K_7$, or the kite graph.</description>

Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph and $(2k+1)$ be a prime integer. Let each vertex of $G$ be colored using one of the $(2k+1)$ colors, say $R_1,R_2,...,R_{2k+1}$. If every vertex has an equal number of neighbors of each color, then the coloring is a $(2k+1)$-neighborhood balanced coloring. We establish a number of results for common families of graphs and present some families of graphs that have this property.</description>

      <title>Topological Indices Among Strong Support Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the irregularity properties of trees with strong support vertex by analyzing two prominent topological indices: the Albertson index and the Sigma index. We further establish extremal bounds for both indices across families of trees defined by given degree sequences. Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be a star trees of order $n$, where $T_1 \cong T_2$, then, we provide Albertson index of $T_1 \cong T_2$. Let $\mathcal{T}_{n, \Delta}$ be a class of trees with $n$ vertices, there are a tree $T^{\prime} \in \mathcal{T}_{n, \Delta}$ such that $\irr(T^{\prime}) &lt; \irr(T)$.</description>

      <title>Schrijver's $\vartheta$-function is not an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph: a counterexample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note addresses an open question concerning a variant of the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function, introduced by Schrijver and independently by McEliece et al. (1978). It provides a complete and detailed presentation of a counterexample demonstrating that this variant does not universally upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph, in contrast to the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function. The counterexample, previously introduced in Example 5.24 of a recent paper by the author, entitled: Observations on graph invariants with the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function (AIMS Mathematics, vol. 9, pp. 15385--15468, April 2024, https://doi.org/10.3934/math.2024747), is revisited and fully detailed here. By resolving this question, the note clarifies a subtle but significant distinction between these two closely related graph invariants.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms of unit distance graphs of layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $\varepsilon\in (0,+\infty)$, consider the metric spaces $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon]$ in the Euclidean plane named layers or strips. B. Baslaugh in 1998 found the minimal width $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ of a layer such that its unit distance graph contains a cycle of a given odd length $k$. The first of the main results of this paper is the fact that the unit distance graphs of two layers $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_1], \mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_2]$ are non-isomorphic for any different values $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2 \in (0,+\infty)$. We also get a multidimensional analogue of this theorem. For given $n,m \in \mathbb{N}, p \in (1,+\infty), \varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, we say that the metric space on $\mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]^m$ with the metric space distance generated by $l_p$-norm in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is a layer $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon)$. We show that the unit distance graphs of multi-layers $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_1), L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_2)$ are non-isomorphic for $\varepsilon_1 \neq \varepsilon_2$.</description>

      <title>The Sch\"utzenberger involution and colored lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colored lattice models can be used to describe many different types of special functions of interest in both algebraic combinatorics and representation theory, for example Schur polynomials, nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials, and characters and Whittaker functions for representations of p-adic groups. A notable example is the metaplectic ice model of which there are actually two different variants: a Gamma and a Delta variant. These variants differ in key aspects but surprisingly produce equal partition functions, which are weighted sums over admissible configurations, and this equality is called the Gamma-Delta duality. The duality was used to prove the analytic continuation of certain multiple Dirichlet series and is highly non-trivial, especially since the number of configurations on each side of the equality can differ.
  In this paper we construct a new family of solvable, colored lattice models and prove that they are dual to existing lattice models in the literature, including the above metaplectic case and the lattice model for (non-metaplectic) Iwahori Whittaker functions together with its crystal limit for Demazure atoms for Cartan type A. The equality of partition functions is shown using Yang-Baxter equations involving R-matrices mixing lattice model rows of types Gamma and Delta.
  For the crystal Demazure lattice model we show that the duality refines to a weight-respecting bijection of states given by the Sch\"utzenberger involution on the associated Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns or semistandard Young tableaux. We also show how the individual steps exchanging two rows in the proof of the duality for the partition functions refines to Berenstein-Kirillov, or Bender-Knuth involutions.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Notions of Projective and Scale-Translation-Invariant Metrics in Coding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projective metrics on vector spaces over finite fields, introduced by Gabidulin and Simonis in 1997, generalize classical metrics in coding theory like the Hamming metric, rank metric, and combinatorial metrics. While these specific metrics have been thoroughly investigated, the overarching theory of projective metrics has remained underdeveloped since their introduction. In this paper, we present and develop the foundational theory of projective metrics, establishing several elementary key results on their characterizing properties, equivalence classes, isometries, constructions, connections with the Hamming metric, associated matroids, sphere sizes and Singleton-like bounds. Furthermore, some general aspects of scale-translation-invariant metrics are examined, with particular focus on their embeddings into larger projective metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking a compact K\"{a}hler manifold as playground, we explore the powerfulness of Hodge index theorem. A main object is the Lorentzian classes on a compact K\"{a}hler manifold, behind which the characterization via Lorentzian polynomials over the K\"{a}hler cone and hence the validity of Hodge index theorem. Along the exploration, we discover several applications in complex geometry that may be unexpected before. (1) For a Lefschetz type operator given by the complete intersection of nef classes, we give a complete characterization of its kernel face against the pseudo-effective cone. (2) We provide a new approach to Teissier's proportionality problem from the validity of hard Lefschetz property. This perspective enables us to establish the extremals for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality on a strictly Lorentzian class, and thus also characterize the most extremal case for a log-concavity sequence given by the intersection numbers of two nef classes. These Lorentzian classes include the fundamental classes of smooth projective varieties or compact K\"{a}hler manifolds as typical examples, hence our result extends Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson's and Fu-Xiao's results in respective settings to broader contexts, e.g. certain algebraic cycle classes given by reducible subvarieties. (3) Furthermore, we also strengthen the proportionality characterization by comparing various quantitative deficits and establishing stability estimates. Two quantitative sharper stability estimates with close relation with complex Monge--Amp\`{e}re equations and Newton-Okounkov bodies are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce standard multigradings on Hibi rings, which are algebras arising from posets. We show that any standard multigrading on a Hibi ring that makes its defining ideal (called the Hibi ideal) homogeneous is induced by a chain of the underlying poset. After that, we calculate the multigraded Hilbert series of Hibi rings by generalizing the theory of $P$-partition and we compute the multidegree polynomials of Hibi rings. Furthermore, we characterize Hibi ideals that are Cartwright-Sturmfels ideals.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Sparse Matrix Coloring and Bicoloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse matrix coloring and bicoloring are fundamental building blocks of sparse automatic differentiation. Bicoloring is particularly advantageous for rectangular Jacobian matrices with at least one dense row and column. Indeed, in such cases, unidirectional row or column coloring demands a number of colors equal to the number of rows or columns. We introduce a new strategy for bicoloring that encompasses both direct and substitution-based decompression approaches. Our method reformulates the two variants of bicoloring as star and acyclic colorings of an augmented symmetric matrix. We extend the concept of neutral colors, previously exclusive to bicoloring, to symmetric colorings, and we propose a post-processing routine that neutralizes colors to further reduce the overall color count. We also present the Julia package SparseMatrixColorings, which includes these new bicoloring algorithms alongside all standard coloring methods for sparse derivative matrix computation. Compared to ColPack, the Julia package also offers enhanced implementations for star and acyclic coloring, vertex ordering, as well as decompression.</description>

Abstract: A majority coloring of a directed graph is a vertex coloring in which each vertex has the same color as at most half of its out-neighbors. In this note we simplify some proof techniques and generalize previously known results on various generalizations of majority coloring. In particular, our unified and simplified approach works for paintability - an on-line analog of the list coloring.</description>

Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs - that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as 1-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lov\'asz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if - for each even cycle $C$ - the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as 1-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng, 2022, provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang, 2004, and independently Zhang and Li, 2012, provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs - in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>

      <title>Polynomials Counting Group Colorings in Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jaeger et al. in 1992 introduced group coloring as the dual concept to group connectivity in graphs. Let $A$ be an additive Abelian group, $ f: E(G)\to A$ and $D$ an orientation of a graph $G$. A vertex coloring $c:V(G)\to A$ is an $(A, f)$-coloring if $c(v)-c(u)\ne f(e)$ for each oriented edge $e=uv$ from $u$ to $v$ with respect to $D$. Kochol introduced the assigning polynomial to count nowhere-zero chains in graphs and general regular matroids associated with their zero-one assignings. Motivated by Kochol's work, we define the $\alpha$-compatible graph and the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G, \alpha; k)$ at $k$ in terms of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs, where $\alpha$ is an assigning of $G$ from its cycles to $\{0,1\}$. We prove that $P(G,\alpha;k)$ evaluates the number of $(A,f)$-colorings of $G$ for any Abelian group $A$ of order $k$ and $f:E(G)\to A$ such that the assigning $\alpha_{D,f}$ given by $f$ equals $\alpha$.Based on Kochol's work, we also show that $k^{-c(G)}P(G,\alpha;k)$ is a polynomial enumerating $(A,f)$-tensions and counting specific nowhere-zero chains.
  By extending Whitney's broken cycle concept to broken compatible cycles, we demonstrate that the absolute value of the coefficient of $k^{|V(G)|-i}$ in $P(G,\alpha;k)$ equals the number of $\alpha$-compatible spanning subgraphs that have $i$ edges and contain no broken $\alpha$-compatible cycles. Based on the combinatorial explanation, we establish a unified order-preserving relation from assignings to cycle-assigning polynomials. Finally, we show that for any assigning $\alpha$ of $G$ with $\alpha(e)=1$ for every loop $e$ of $G$, the coefficients of the cycle-assigning polynomial $P(G,\alpha;k)$ are nonzero and alternate in sign, and further conjecture that the sequence of absolute values of its coefficients is unimodal and log-concave.</description>

      <title>Proof of Frankl's conjecture on cross-intersecting families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are called cross-intersecting if for every $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$, the intersection $F\cap G$ is non-empty. For any positive integers $n$ and $k$, let $\binom{[n]}{k}$ denote the family of all $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Let $t, s, k, n$ be non-negative integers with $k \geq s+1$ and $n \geq 2 k+t$. In 2016, Frankl proved that if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k+t}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ are cross-intersecting families, and $\mathcal{F}$ is $(t+1)$-intersecting and $|\mathcal{F}| \geq 1$, then $|\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-k-t}{k}+1$. Furthermore, Frankl conjectured that under an additional condition $\binom{[k+t+s]} {k+t}\subseteq\mathcal{F}$, the following inequality holds: $$ |\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{k+t+s}{k+t}+\binom{n}{k}-\sum_{i=0}^s\binom{k+t+s}{i}\binom{n-k-t-s}{k-i}. $$ In this paper, we prove this conjecture. The key ingredient is to establish a theorem for cross-intersecting families with a restricted universe. Moreover, we derive an analogous result for this conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Zonotopal algebras of vector arrangements are combinatorially-defined algebras with connections to approximation theory, introduced by Holtz and Ron and independently by Ardila and Postnikov. We show that the internal zonotopal algebra of a cographical vector arrangement is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a certain configuration space introduced by Moseley, Proudfoot, and Young. We also study an integral form of this algebra, which in the cographical case is isomorphic to the integral cohomology ring. Our results rely on interpreting the internal zonotopal algebra of a totally unimodular arrangement as an orbit harmonics ring, that is, as the associated graded of the ring of functions on a finite set of lattice points.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the fractional chromatic number associated with the direct product of signed graphs. It shows that if $(H,\tau)$ is a signed circulant graph $G(n,S,T)$, then for any signed graph $(G,\sigma)$, the fractional chromatic number of their direct product is the lower number between the fractional chromatic number of $(G,\sigma)$ and $(H,\tau)$.</description>

      <title>On possible uniform Tur\'an densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a family of $3$-graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the uniform Tur\'{a}n density $\pi_{\therefore}(\mathcal{F})$ is defined as the infimum $d\in[0,1]$ for which any sufficiently large uniformly $d$-dense $3$-graph - that is, a $3$-graph which has edge-density at least $d$ on all linearly sized subsets - contains a copy of some $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Let $\Pi_{\therefore,\text{fin}}$ denote the set of all possible uniform Tur\'{a}n densities of finite families. Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and R\"{o}dl introduced a family of constructions for lower bounds on uniform Tur\'an densities called palette constructions. We show that $\Pi_{\therefore,\text{fin}}$ contains every $d$ that is obtained as the uniform density of an optimized palette construction. A corollary of this is that $\Pi_{\therefore,\text{fin}}$ contains the set of Lagrangians of $3$-graphs and includes irrational numbers. Our work complements a recent result of Lamaison, which states that every value in $\Pi_{\therefore,\text{fin}}$ can be approximated by uniform densities of palette constructions.</description>

      <title>A large deviation principle for block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of large deviations for block model random graphs in the dense regime. Following Chatterjee-Varadhan(2011), we establish an LDP for dense block models, viewed as random graphons. As an application of our result, we study upper tail large deviations for homomorphism densities of regular graphs. We identify the existence of a "symmetric" phase, where the graph, conditioned on the rare event, looks like a block model with the same block sizes as the generating graphon. In specific examples, we also identify the existence of a "symmetry breaking" regime, where the conditional structure is not a block model with compatible dimensions. This identifies a "reentrant phase transition" phenomenon for this problem -- analogous to one established for Erdos-Renyi random graphs (Chatterjee-Dey(2010), Chatterjee-Varadhan(2011)). Finally, extending the analysis of Lubetzky-Zhao(2015), we identify the precise boundary between the symmetry and symmetry breaking regime for homomorphism densities of regular graphs and the operator norm on Erdos-Renyi bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Triangle processes on graphs with given degree sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The switch chain is a well-studied Markov chain which generates random graphs with a given degree sequence and has uniform stationary distribution. Motivated by the high number of triangles seen in some real-world networks, we study a variant of the switch chain which is more likely to produce graphs with higher numbers of triangles. Specifically, we apply a Metropolis scheme designed to have the following stationary distribution: graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{\min\{t(G),\nu\}}$, where $t(G)$ is the number of triangles in $G$ and $\nu$ is a cut-off value introduced to moderate the impact of graphs with a very high number of triangles. We assume that the ``activity'' $\lambda$ satisfies $\lambda\geq 1$, and call the resulting chain the modified Metropolis switch chain. We prove that the modified Metropolis switch chain is rapidly mixing whenever the (standard) switch chain is rapidly mixing, provided that the activity and maximum degree are not too large.
  The triangle switch (or ``$\triangle$-switch'') chain is a restriction of the switch chain which only performs switches that change the set of triangles in the graph. We prove that the $\triangle$-switch chain is irreducible for any degree sequence with minimum degree at least 3, and prove a rapid mixing result for the modified Metropolis $\triangle$-switch chain.
  Finally, we investigate the distribution of triangles in random graphs with given degrees, under both the uniform distribution and the distribution in which graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{t(G)}$. Our analysis implies that the imposition of the cut-off $\nu$ does not significantly impact the behaviour of these modified Metropolis chains over polynomially many steps</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis and efficient random sampling of directed ordered acyclic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are directed graphs in which there is no path from a vertex to itself. DAGs are an omnipresent data structure in computer science and the problem of counting the DAGs of given number of vertices and to sample them uniformly at random has been solved respectively in the 70's and the 00's. In this paper, we propose to explore a new variation of this model where DAGs are endowed with an independent ordering of the out-edges of each vertex, thus allowing to model a wide range of existing data structures. We provide efficient algorithms for sampling objects of this new class, both with or without control on the number of edges, and obtain an asymptotic equivalent of their number. We also show the applicability of our method by providing an effective algorithm for the random generation of classical labelled DAGs with a prescribed number of vertices and edges, based on a similar approach. This is the first known algorithm for sampling labelled DAGs with full control on the number of edges, and it meets a need in terms of applications, that had already been acknowledged in the literature.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of affine ADE Nakajima quiver varieties via collapsing fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14361v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a universal substitution formula that compares generating series of Euler characteristics of Nakajima quiver varieties associated with affine ADE diagrams at generic and at certain nongeneric stability conditions via a study of collapsing fibres in the associated variation of GIT map, unifying and generalising earlier results of the last two authors with N\'emethi and of Nakajima. As a special case, we compute generating series of Euler characteristics of noncommutative Quot schemes of Kleinian orbifolds. In type A and rank 1, we give a second, combinatorial proof of our substitution formula, using torus localisation and partition enumeration. This gives a combinatorial model of the fibers of the variation of GIT map, and also leads to relations between our results and the representation theory of the affine and finite Lie algebras in type A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between quadratic Hodge classes on moduli spaces of pseudostable and stable curves given by the contraction morphism $\mathcal{T}.$ While Mumford relations do not hold in the pseudostable case, we show that one can express the (pullback via $\mathcal{T}$ of the) Chern classes of $\mathbb{E}\oplus \mathbb{E}^\vee$ solely in terms of descendants and strata classes. We organize the combinatorial structure of the pullback of products of two pseudostable $\lambda$ classes and obtain an explicit comparison of arbitrary pseudostable and stable quadratic Hodge integrals.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic aspects of semistability of quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding the semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding the maximizers of King's criterion, and computing the Harder--Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we refer to as King cones. For rank-one representations, we demonstrate that these King cones can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, enabling us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability in strongly polynomial time. Our approach employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>

      <title>Undecidability in the Ramsey theory of polynomial equations and Hilbert's tenth problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that several sets of interest arising from the study of partition regularity and density Ramsey theory of polynomial equations over integral domains are undecidable. In particular, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$ is undecidable conditional on Hilbert's tenth problem for $\mathbb{Q}$. For other integral domains, we get the analogous result unconditionally. More generally, we determine the exact lightface complexity of the various sets of interest. For example, we show that the set of homogeneous polynomials $p \in \mathbb{F}_q(t)[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ for which the equation $p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) = 0$ is partition regular over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)\setminus\{0\}$ is $\Pi_2^0$-complete.
  We also prove several other results of independent interest. These include a compactness principle and a uniformity principle for density Ramsey theory on countable cancellative left amenable semigroups, as well as the existence of the natural extension for measure preserving systems of countable cancellative left reversible semigroups.</description>
