      <title>Impact of Au Ion Implantation on 2D $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ for Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in 2D magnetic materials highlight their potential in semiconductors, magnetism, and spintronics, particularly in tuning magnetic properties for spintronic applications. This study investigates the impact of low-energy (30 KeV) Au ion implantation on 2D layered exfoliated $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ flakes prepared on Si/SiO$_2$ substrates using the Scotch tape method. Five different ion doses (5$\times10^{13}$, 1$\times10^{14}$, 5$\times10^{14}$, 1$\times10^{15}$, and 2.5$\times10^{15}$ ions/cm$^2$) were used to modify the morphology, composition, structural, and vibrational properties of the samples. The implantation introduces significant changes in morphology and magnetic behavior, leading to an increase in Curie temperature and an attribution from superexchange to double exchange interactions. The reduced exchange energy gaps and modified magnetic moments attribute to Au ions intercalation in $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ underscore the potential of ions implantation to tune the magnetic properties of 2D materials for advanced spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Parametric Analysis of First High-Gain Vertical Fe-doped Ultrafast Ga2O3 Photoconductive Semiconductor Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate, as part of a Lawrence-Livermore-National-Laboratory (LLNL) sponsored-research work initiated in February of 2021, the parametric performance analysis of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) Fe-doped Ga2O3 photoconductive semiconductor switch (FG-PCSS) with embedded electrode. The detailed SILVACO based simulation of the FG-PCSS uses experimentally obtained lifetime, absorption coefficient, and mobility data. The key analysis results, demonstrated first to the sponsor LLNL in 2022, focus on the performance of the FG-PCSS under relatively high electric field and optical-excitation energy with specific regard to current gain, quantum efficiency, on-state resistance, and impact of beam position. The parametric analysis indicates that a high-gain operation yielding a low-cost laser beam for the FG-PCSS is possible.</description>

      <title>Double Negative Metamaterials in Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water waves present both opportunities and hazards, which demand precise control to effectively exploit their energy and mitigate their destructive effects. Leveraging the unique propagation characteristic of negative refraction enables versatile strategies for achieving such control. Here, we propose a Veselago-Pendry double negative metamaterial (DNM) for water waves constructed by nested gears and split tubes. This uniform array structure realizes effective negative water depth and gravity distributions, enabling tunable negative refraction that resolves the unclear structure-propagation relationships and stringent layout requirements of prior negative refraction structures. By employing coherent potential approximation (CPA), negative effective water depth ue and gravity ge are predicted. The predicted DNM parameters align well with band structures, and are validated by simulations of isolation, wave bending and all-angle imaging with surface waves excitation. A simplified experiment demonstrating water wave bending was successfully performed, matching the analytical predictions and simulation results well. Through quantitative mapping between structural parameters and propagation properties that enables tunable bandgaps and controllable negative refraction, DNMs furnish a transformative toolkit for coastal engineering, and are able to calm harbors, boost wave-energy harvesters, and steer river-bend currents to curb erosion.</description>

      <title>Thin-Film Solar Photovoltaics: Trends and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technologies address crucial challenges in solar energy applications, including scalability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. This paper reviews critically, thin-film technologies such as amorphous silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). It also discusses emerging technologies, including perovskites, copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS), quantum dots (QDs), organic photovoltaics (OPV), and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Among these, CdTe and CIGS currently dominate commercial viability, achieving laboratory-scale efficiencies of 23.1% and 23.6%, respectively. Perovskites have notably advanced, reaching a laboratory efficiency of 26.7%. Thin-film PV technologies significantly reduce material use and manufacturing costs, offering distinct advantages such as flexibility and lightweight structures, thereby enabling diverse applications from building-integrated systems to portable electronic devices. Despite these benefits, broader adoption remains limited by challenges including long-term stability, toxicity concerns, and material scarcity. Addressing these challenges through advancements in tandem architectures, improved encapsulation strategies, and sustainable material sourcing is essential for thin-film PV technologies to substantially contribute to the global renewable energy transition.</description>

      <title>Injection Locking and Coupling Dynamics in Superconducting Nanowire based Cryogenic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillators designed to function at cryogenic temperatures play a critical role in superconducting electronics and quantum computing by providing stable, low noise signals with minimal energy loss.Here we present a comprehensive numerical study of injection locking and mutual coupling dynamics in superconducting nanowire based cryogenic oscillators.Using the design space of standalone ScNW based oscillator, we investigate two critical mechanisms that govern frequency synchronization and signal coordination in cryogenic computing architectures.First, an injection locking induced by an external AC signal with a frequency near the oscillators natural frequency, and second, the mutual coupling dynamics between two ScNW oscillators under varying coupling strengths.We identify key design parameters such as shunt resistance, nanowire inductance, and coupling strength that govern the locking range.Additionally, we examine how the amplitude of the injected signal affects the amplitude of the locked oscillation, offering valuable insights for power aware oscillator synchronization.Furthermore, we analyze mutual synchronization between coupled ScNW oscillators using capacitive and resistive coupling elements.Our results reveal that the phase difference between oscillators can be precisely controlled by tuning the coupling strength, enabling programmable phase encoded information processing.These findings could enable building ScNW based oscillatory neural networks, synchronized cryogenic logic blocks, and on chip cryogenic resonator arrays.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-free terahertz nonreciprocity via temporal dissipative barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) nonreciprocal devices are essential for advancing future fundamental science, wireless communications, imaging, and sensing. Current THz nonreciprocal devices mostly rely on magnetic materials, which, however, suffer from large volume, operation under an external magnetic field, and low-temperature environment, rendering them poorly compatible with miniaturized developments. Here,we propose an unconventional method for achieving THz nonreciprocity free from magnetic materials. The scheme relies on a temporal dissipative barrier, a transient loss variation generated by photoexcited carriers, and the nonreciprocity arises from the distinct coupling behavior for different polarizations with the barrier. The isolation efficiency correlates with the temporal barrier width, resonant mode detuning, and the working frequency, and has been significantly enhanced by introducing a dark mode. We experimentally confirm our method in a THz optically active metasurface with wave-flow isolation exceeding 20 dB across a bandwidth greater than 0.4 THz. Theoretical predictions indicate peak isolation surpassing 60 dB, with experimental results achieving over 30 dB at 0.7 THz. Our approach unlocks the potential of miniaturized, integrated, magnetic-free THz nonreciprocal devices for various applications.</description>

      <title>Flow-driven magnetic microcatheter for superselective arterial embolization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimally invasive interventions performed inside brain vessels with the synergistic use of microcatheters pushed over guidewires have revolutionized the way aneurysms, stroke, arteriovenous malformations, brain tumors and other cerebrovascular conditions are being treated. However, a significant portion of the brain vasculature remains inaccessible from within because the conventional catheterization technique based on transmitting forces from the proximal to the distal end of the instruments imposes stringent constraints on their diameter and stiffness. Here we overcome this mechanical barrier by microengineering a new class of ultraminiaturized magnetic microcatheters in the form of an inflatable flat tube, making them extremely flexible and capable of harnessing the kinetic energy of blood flow for endovascular navigation. We introduce a compact and versatile magnetic steering platform that is compatible with conventional bi-plane fluoroscope imaging, and demonstrate for the first time safe and effortless navigation and tracking of hard-to-reach, distal, tortuous arteries that are as small as 180 um in diameter with a curvature radius as small as 0.69 mm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superselective infusion of contrast and embolic liquid agents, all in a porcine model. These results pave the way to reach, diagnose, and treat currently inaccessible distal arteries that may be at risk of bleeding or feeding a tumor. Our endovascular technology can also be used to selectively target tissues for drug or gene delivery from within the arteries, not only in the central and peripheral nervous system but almost any other organ system, with improved accuracy, speed and safety.</description>

      <title>Towards ultracompact photonic chips using higher-order modes in closely spaced waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are gaining traction in the field of telecommunications and information processing for their low-loss and high-throughput data transmission in comparison to electronic integrated circuits. However, they are still not used as widely as their electronic counterparts due to a relatively large footprint of photonic chips. One limiting factor to their size is the need to separate optical components by distances on the order of the working wavelength or larger to minimize optical crosstalk between them. In this work, we consider the fundamental and higher-order modes in closely spaced straight and bent waveguides with relatively small cross sections and find that higher-order modes allow one to substantially reduce the crosstalk in both cases. This can be used to considerably reduce the dimensions of photonic chips. We also propose on-chip components that allow selective excitation of higher-order modes. In addition, we design a directional coupler, a 3-dB splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer capable of operating on higher-order modes. Other ultracompact photonic-chip components, such as optical interconnects, switches, transceivers, and phased waveguide arrays for on-chip LiDAR scanners, can be designed as well based on similar principles.</description>

      <title>Extreme-ultraviolet laser generation at 118 nm via adaptive random additional periodic-phase engineering in a LiF crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) coherent sources below 120nm are of paramount significance for promoting next-generation nano-scale lithography,precision spectroscopy, and exploring the emerging physical phenomena in quantum materials. Nonlinear optical conversion serves as the only feasible approach to obtain solid state EUV lasers, yet the intrinsic strong absorption at EUV and giant phase mismatch among light waves have hindered the realization of highly-efficient EUV light sources. Herein, we propose a random additional periodic phase (RAPP) strategy in third-order nonlinear crystals to overcome these problems, that an artificially designed random phase grating at micrometer-scales is embedded in the homogeneous bulk crystal, thus adaptively compensating the phase mismatch between fundamental-wave and third-harmonic waves. For the first time, the EUV laser at 118nm is demonstrated in the RAPP lithium fluoride (LiF) crystals with wide period distributions, where the highest output power is over 90uW. To the best our knowledge, this is the shortest wavelength among all solid-state laser systems, which represents a significant advance in nonlinear optical materials and opens new roadmap toward high-brightness EUV sources.</description>

      <title>Look-Up Table-Correction for Beam Hardening-Induced Signal of Clinical Dark-Field Chest Radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Material structures at the micrometer scale cause ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering, e.g., seen in lung tissue or plastic foams. In grating-based X-ray imaging, this causes a reduction of the fringe visibility, forming a dark-field signal. Polychromatic beam hardening also changes visibility, adding a false dark-field signal due to attenuation, even in homogeneous, non-scattering materials. Purpose: The objective of this study is to develop a fast, simple, and robust method to correct dark-field signals and bony structures present due to beam hardening on dark-field chest radiographs of study participants. Methods: The method is based on calibration measurements and image processing. Beam hardening by bones and soft tissue is modeled by aluminum and water, respectively, which have no microstructure and thus only generate an artificial dark-field signal. Look-up tables were then created for both. By using a weighted mean of these, forming a single look-up table, and using the attenuation images, the artificial dark-field signal and thus the bone structures present are reduced for study participants. Results: It was found that applying a correction using a weighted look-up table leads to a significant reduction of bone structures in the dark-field image. The weighting of the aluminum component has a substantial impact on the degree to which bone structures remain visible in the dark-field image. Furthermore, a large negative bias in the dark-field image, dependent on the aluminum weighting, was successfully corrected. Conclusions: The beam-hardening-induced signal in the dark-field images was successfully reduced using the method described. The choice of aluminum weighting to suppress rib structures, as well as the selection of bias correction, should be evaluated based on the specific clinical question.</description>

      <title>3D DNA Origami-Enabled Molecularly Addressable Optical Nanocircuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical nanocircuit concept provides a predictive framework analogous to an electric RLC circuit, where induced dipoles in plasmonic nanoparticle (NPs), ohmic losses in NPs, and dielectric gaps serve as inductors (L), capacitors (C), and resistors (R), respectively. This modular theory allows unprecedented design flexibility, expanding the range of achievable optical resonances in plasmonic clusters. However, existing experimental approaches, such as atomic force microscope tip-enabled nanomanipulation and electron-beam lithography, lack the critical accuracy in nanogap tuning and molecular loading required for applications like PRET. Here, we introduce a molecularly addressable optical nanocircuit enabled by DNA origami. First, we theoretically and experimentally confirmed that gold (Au) NPs and dye-loaded DNA origami can function as different circuit elements: R- and C-coupled L and R-coupled C, respectively. To assemble large Au NPs into designer optical nanocircuits, we utilized a mechanically robust 3D DNA origami design rather than conventionally used 2D origami sheet. This platform provided high reproducibility and accuracy in assembling a range of structures-from dimers to tetramers-with controlled symmetry, heterogeneity, and nanogap tunability. Together with ultrasmoothness and uniformity of Au NPs, we achieved the highest Q-factor for magnetic resonance of a nanoparticle-based optical nanocircuit (~19.2). Also, selective molecular cargo loading onto designated 3D DNA origami sites within plasmonic clusters enabled deterministic, predictive light-molecule coupling in optical nanocircuits. This resulted in 100-fold stronger PRET signal in dimeric clusters compared to monomeric NPs. Our approach opens promising directions in designing custom optical resonances for use in molecular sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of a Vanadium Dioxide-Based Ultra-Broadband Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a VO2-based metamaterial absorber optimized for ultra-broadband, polarization-insensitive performance in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. The absorber consists of a patterned VO2 metasurface, a low-loss MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. Exploiting the phase transition of VO2, the design enables dynamic control of electromagnetic absorption. Full-wave simulations show an average absorptance of 98.15% across a 5.38THz bandwidth (5.72-11.11THz) and over 99% absorption sustained across 3.35THz. The absorber maintains stable performance for varying polarization angles and both TE and TM modes under oblique incidence. Impedance analysis confirms strong matching to free space, reducing reflection and eliminating transmission. Parametric analysis investigates the influence of VO2 conductivity, MF2 thickness, and unit cell periodicity on performance. Compared to recent THz metamaterial absorbers, the proposed design achieves broader bandwidth, higher efficiency, and simpler implementation. These characteristics make it suitable for THz sensing, imaging, wireless communication, and adaptive photonic systems, and position it as a promising platform for tunable and reconfigurable THz modules.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced decomposition of Bi14WO24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the high-pressure behaviour Bi14WO24, a high oxide ion conductor member of the Bi2O3-WO3 binary system. The tetragonal polymorph of Bi14WO24 was studied under high-pressure conditions using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. It was found that in contrast to isostructural Bi14CrO24 and Bi14MoO24 which experience a phase transition around 5 GPa, in our study Bi14WO24 undergoes an irreversible chemical decomposition into Bi2O3 and WO3 at 2.85(5) GPa. The pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters of Bi14WO24 was also determined, and hence the linear compressibility along different axes and room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state were derived. Bulk modulus of tetragonal Bi14WO24 was found to be 49.8(2.6) GPa, and the linear compressibility of the two crystallographic axes, \k{appa}a and \k{appa}c were 6.94(2) 10-3 GPa-1 and = 3.73(1) 10-3 GPa-1, respectively. The pressure induced decomposition can be attributed to the favourable increasing density of the system to accommodate the pressure induced stress.</description>

      <title>Propagation Performance of Terahertz Channels in Lunar Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing lunar exploration programs require robust communication systems for dust-laden environments, necessitating comprehensive understanding of channel propagation characteristics. We present an analysis of terahertz channel propagation through lunar dust environments, critical for reliable communication and sensing infrastructure. We develop an extended Mie scattering model incorporating unique properties of lunar dust particles from Apollo samples (10084, 14003, 70051), including irregular morphology, dielectric characteristics, and charge-dependent behavior. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, we examine power and bit error rate performance across varying dust conditions, revealing distinct relationships between particle characteristics and channel performance.</description>

      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees of Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of degrees of freedom (NDoF) in a communication channel fundamentally limits the number of independent spatial modes available for transmitting and receiving information. Although the NDoF can be computed numerically for specific configurations using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel operator, this approach provides limited physical insight. In this paper, we introduce a simple analytical estimate for the NDoF between arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions in free space. In the electrically large limit, where the NDoF is high, it is well approximated by the mutual shadow area, measured in units of wavelength squared. This area corresponds to the projected overlap of the regions, integrated over all lines of sight, and captures their effective spatial coupling. The proposed estimate generalizes and unifies several previously established results, including those based on Weyl's law, shadow area, and the paraxial approximation. We analyze several example configurations to illustrate the accuracy of the estimate and validate it through comparisons with numerical SVD computations of the propagation channel. The results provide both practical tools and physical insight for the design and analysis of high-capacity communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>An Overview of CV-MDI-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.</description>
