      <title>Positivity sets of hinge functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate which subsets of the real plane are realisable as the set of points on which a one-layer ReLU neural network takes a positive value. In the case of cones we give a full characterisation of such sets. Furthermore, we give a necessary condition for any subset of $\mathbb R^d$. We give various examples of such one-layer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Color-Constrained Arborescences in Edge-Colored Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a multigraph $G$ whose edges are colored from the set $[q]:=\{1,2,\ldots,q\}$ (\emph{$q$-colored graph}), and a vector $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{q}) \in \mathbb{N}^{q}$ (\emph{color-constraint}), a subgraph $H$ of $G$ is called \emph{$\alpha$-colored}, if $H$ has exactly $\alpha_i$ edges of color $i$ for each $i \in[q]$. In this paper, we focus on $\alpha$-colored arborescences (spanning out-trees) in $q$-colored multidigraphs. We study the decision, counting and search versions of this problem. It is known that the decision and search problems are polynomial-time solvable when $q=2$ and that the decision problem is NP-complete when $q$ is arbitrary. However the complexity status of the problem for fixed $q$ was open for $q &gt; 2$. We show that, for a $q$-colored digraph $G$ and a vertex $s$ in $G$, the number of $\alpha$-colored arborescences in $G$ rooted at $s$ for all color-constraints $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^q$ can be read from the determinant of a symbolic matrix in $q-1$ indeterminates. This result extends Tutte's matrix-tree theorem for directed graphs and gives a polynomial-time algorithm for the counting and decision problems for fixed $q$. We also use it to design an algorithm that finds an $\alpha$-colored arborescence when one exists. Finally, we study the weighted variant of the problem and give a polynomial-time algorithm (when $q$ is fixed) which finds a minimum weight solution.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchy of Saturating Matching Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study three matching problems all of which came up quite recently in the field of machine teaching. The cost of a matching is defined in such a way that, for some formal model of teaching, it equals (or bounds) the number of labeled examples needed to solve a given teaching task. We show how the cost parameters associated with these problems depend on each other and how they are related to other well known combinatorial parameters (like, for instance, the VC-dimension).</description>

      <title>Sheaf-Theoretic Causal Emergence for Resilience Analysis in Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed systems often exhibit emergent behaviors that impact their resilience (Franz-Kaiser et al., 2020; Adilson E. Motter, 2002; Jianxi Gao, 2016). This paper presents a theoretical framework combining attributed graph models, flow-on-graph simulation, and sheaf-theoretic causal emergence analysis to evaluate system resilience. We model a distributed system as a graph with attributes (capturing component state and connections) and use sheaf theory to formalize how local interactions compose into global states. A flow simulation on this graph propagates functional loads and failures. To assess resilience, we apply the concept of causal emergence, quantifying whether macro-level dynamics (coarse-grained groupings) exhibit stronger causal efficacy (via effective information) than micro-level dynamics. The novelty lies in uniting sheaf-based formalization with causal metrics to identify emergent resilient structures. We discuss limitless potential applications (illustrated by microservices, neural networks, and power grids) and outline future steps toward implementing this framework (Lake et al., 2015).</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and native (real-world) RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive base pairs frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in native RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in native secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connected undirected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if for every pair of vertices there is a unique shortest path connecting them. It has been conjectured that for finite groups, the only geodetic Cayley graphs are odd cycles and complete graphs. In this article we present a series of theoretical results which contribute to a computer search verifying this conjecture for all groups of size up to 1024. The conjecture is also verified for several infinite families of groups including dihedral and some families of nilpotent groups. Two key results which enable the computer search to reach as far as it does are: if the center of a group has even order, then the conjecture holds (this eliminates all $2$-groups from our computer search); if a Cayley graph is geodetic then there are bounds relating the size of the group, generating set and center (which significantly cuts down the number of generating sets which must be searched).</description>

      <title>Degree-balanced decompositions of cubic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every cubic graph on $n$ vertices contains a spanning subgraph in which the number of vertices of each degree deviates from $\frac{n}{4}$ by at most $\frac{1}{2}$, up to three exceptions. This resolves the conjecture of Alon and Wei (Irregular subgraphs, Combin. Probab. Comput. 32(2) (2023), 269--283) for cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Totally $\Delta$-modular IPs with two non-zeros in most rows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integer programs (IPs) on constraint matrices with bounded subdeterminants are conjectured to be solvable in polynomial time. We give a strongly polynomial time algorithm to solve IPs where the constraint matrix has bounded subdeterminants and at most two non-zeros per row after removing a constant number of rows and columns. This result extends the work by Fiorini, Joret, Weltge \&amp; Yuditsky (J. ACM 72(1), 1-50 (2025)) by allowing for additional, unifying constraints and variables.</description>
