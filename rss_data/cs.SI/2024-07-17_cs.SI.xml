      <title>Exact Label Recovery in Euclidean Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a family of label recovery problems on weighted Euclidean random graphs. The vertices of a graph are embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$ according to a Poisson point process, and are assigned to a discrete community label. Our goal is to infer the vertex labels, given edge weights whose distributions depend on the vertex labels as well as their geometric positions. Our general model provides a geometric extension of popular graph and matrix problems, including submatrix localization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization, and includes the Geometric Stochastic Block Model (proposed by Sankararaman and Baccelli) as a special case. We study the fundamental limits of exact recovery of the vertex labels. Under a mild distinctness of distributions assumption, we determine the information-theoretic threshold for exact label recovery, in terms of a Chernoff-Hellinger divergence criterion. Impossibility of recovery below the threshold is proven by a unified analysis using a Cram\'er lower bound. Achievability above the threshold is proven via an efficient two-phase algorithm, where the first phase computes an almost-exact labeling through a local propagation scheme, while the second phase refines the labels. The information-theoretic threshold is dictated by the performance of the so-called genie estimator, which decodes the label of a single vertex given all the other labels. This shows that our proposed models exhibit the local-to-global amplification phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Introducing Total Harmonic Resistance for Graph Robustness under Edge Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing and improving the robustness of a graph $G$ are critical steps in network design and analysis. To this end, we consider the optimisation problem of removing $k$ edges from $G$ such that the resulting graph has minimal robustness, simulating attacks or failures. In this paper, we propose total harmonic resistance as a new robustness measure for this purpose - and compare it to the recently proposed forest index [Zhu et al., IEEE Trans.\ Inf.\ Forensics and Security, 2023]. Both measures are related to the established total effective resistance measure, but their advantage is that they can handle disconnected graphs. This is also important for originally connected graphs due to the removal of the $k$ edges. To compare our measure with the forest index, we first investigate exact solutions for small examples. The best $k$ edges to select when optimizing for the forest index lie at the periphery. Our proposed measure, in turn, prioritizes more central edges, which should be beneficial for most applications. Furthermore, we adapt a generic greedy algorithm to our optimization problem with the total harmonic resistance. With this algorithm, we perform a case study on the Berlin road network and also apply the algorithm to established benchmark graphs. The results are similar as for the small example graphs above and indicate the higher suitability of the new measure.</description>

      <title>Using Causality to Infer Coordinated Attacks in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of social media has been accompanied by a dark side with the ease of creating fake accounts and disseminating misinformation through coordinated attacks. Existing methods to identify such attacks often rely on thematic similarities or network-based approaches, overlooking the intricate causal relationships that underlie coordinated actions. This work introduces a novel approach for detecting coordinated attacks using Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM), a technique that infers causality from temporal relationships between user activity. We build on the theoretical framework of CCM by incorporating topic modelling as a basis for further optimizing its performance. We apply CCM to real-world data from the infamous IRA attack on US elections, achieving F1 scores up to 75.3% in identifying coordinated accounts. Furthermore, we analyse the output of our model to identify the most influential users in a community. We apply our model to a case study involving COVID-19 anti-vax related discussions on Twitter. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in uncovering causal structures of coordinated behaviour, offering a promising avenue for mitigating the threat of malicious campaigns on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Identifying Coordinated Activities on Online Social Networks Using Contrast Pattern Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation on social media networks has become increasingly concerning. With a significant portion of the population using social media on a regular basis, there are growing efforts by malicious organizations to manipulate public opinion through coordinated campaigns. Current methods for identifying coordinated user accounts typically rely on either similarities in user behaviour, latent coordination in activity traces, or classification techniques. In our study, we propose a framework based on the hypothesis that coordinated users will demonstrate abnormal growth in their behavioural patterns over time relative to the wider population. Specifically, we utilize the EPClose algorithm to extract contrasting patterns of user behaviour during a time window of malicious activity, which we then compare to a historical time window. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach using real-world data, and our results show a minimum increase of 10% in the F1 score compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>User Behavior Analysis and Clustering in Peace Elite: Insights and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of user behavior and clustering in Peace Elite, a popular mobile battle royale game, employing temporal and static data mining techniques to uncover distinct player segments. Our methodology encompasses time series K-means clustering, graph-based algorithms (DeepWalk and LINE), and static attribute clustering, visualized through innovative hybrid charts. Key findings reveal significant variations in player engagement, skill levels, and social interactions across five primary user segments, ranging from highly active and skilled players to inactive or new users. We also analyze the impact of external factors on user retention and the network structure within clusters, uncovering correlations between cluster cohesion and player activity levels. This research provides valuable insights for game developers and marketers, offering data-driven recommendations for personalized game experiences, targeted marketing strategies, and improved player retention in online gaming environments.</description>

      <title>What's in a Niche? Migration Patterns in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad topics in online platforms represent a type of meso-scale between individual user-defined communities and the whole platform; they typically consist of related communities that address different facets of a shared topic. Users often engage with the topic by moving among the communities within a single category. We find that there are strong regularities in the aggregate pattern of user migration, in that the communities comprising a topic can be ordered in a partial order such that there is more migration in the direction defined by the partial order than against it. Ordered along this overall direction, we find that communities in aggregate become smaller, less toxic, and more linguistically distinctive, suggesting a picture consistent with specialization. We study directions defined not just in the movement of users but also by the movement of URLs and by the direction of mentions from one community to another; each of these produces a consistent direction, but the directions all differ from each other.
  We show how, collectively, these distinct trends help organize the structure of large online topics and compare our findings across both Reddit and Wikipedia and in simulations.</description>

      <title>Interaction Matters: An Evaluation Framework for Interactive Dialogue Assessment on English Second Language Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation framework for interactive dialogue assessment in the context of English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers. Our framework collects dialogue-level interactivity labels (e.g., topic management; 4 labels in total) and micro-level span features (e.g., backchannels; 17 features in total). Given our annotated data, we study how the micro-level features influence the (higher level) interactivity quality of ESL dialogues by constructing various machine learning-based models. Our results demonstrate that certain micro-level features strongly correlate with interactivity quality, like reference word (e.g., she, her, he), revealing new insights about the interaction between higher-level dialogue quality and lower-level linguistic signals. Our framework also provides a means to assess ESL communication, which is useful for language assessment.</description>

      <title>Conquering images and the basis of transformative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our rapid immersion into online life has made us all ill. Through the generation, personalization, and dissemination of enchanting imagery, artificial technologies commodify the minds and hearts of the masses with nauseating precision and scale. Online networks, artificial intelligence (AI), social media, and digital news feeds fine-tune our beliefs and pursuits by establishing narratives that subdivide and polarize our communities and identities. Meanwhile those commanding these technologies conquer the final frontiers of our interior lives, social relations, earth, and cosmos. In the Attention Economy, our agency is restricted and our vitality is depleted for their narcissistic pursuits and pleasures. Generative AI empowers the forces that homogenize and eradicate life, not through some stupid "singularity" event, but through devaluing human creativity, labor, and social life. Using a fractured lens, we will examine how narratives and networks influence us on mental, social, and algorithmic levels. We will discuss how atomizing imagery -- ideals and pursuits that alienate, rather than invigorate the individual -- hijack people's agency to sustain the forces that destroy them. We will discover how empires build digital networks that optimize society and embolden narcissists to enforce social binaries that perpetuate the ceaseless expansion of consumption, exploitation, and hierarchy. Structural hierarchy in the world is reified through hierarchy in our beliefs and thinking. Only by seeing images as images and appreciating the similarity shared by opposing narratives can we facilitate transformative action and break away from the militaristic systems plaguing our lives.</description>

      <title>Competition between group interactions and nonlinearity in voter dynamics on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social dynamics are often driven by both pairwise (i.e., dyadic) relationships and higher-order (i.e., polyadic) group relationships, which one can describe using hypergraphs. To gain insight into the impact of polyadic relationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a polyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), in which we incorporate the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions that are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the competition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves consensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimum minimizing exit time {\tau} . We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on annealed uniform hypergraphs with N nodes, for which {\tau} scales as A ln N, where the prefactor A depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint factors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and nonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such competing effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.</description>

      <title>Graph Structure Prompt Learning: A Novel Methodology to Improve Performance of Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely applied in graph data modeling. However, existing GNNs are often trained in a task-driven manner that fails to fully capture the intrinsic nature of the graph structure, resulting in sub-optimal node and graph representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Graph structure Prompt Learning method (GPL) to enhance the training of GNNs, which is inspired by prompt mechanisms in natural language processing. GPL employs task-independent graph structure losses to encourage GNNs to learn intrinsic graph characteristics while simultaneously solving downstream tasks, producing higher-quality node and graph representations. In extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets, after being trained by GPL, GNNs significantly outperform their original performance on node classification, graph classification, and edge prediction tasks (up to 10.28%, 16.5%, and 24.15%, respectively). By allowing GNNs to capture the inherent structural prompts of graphs in GPL, they can alleviate the issue of over-smooth and achieve new state-of-the-art performances, which introduces a novel and effective direction for GNN research with potential applications in various domains.</description>

      <title>GraphFM: A Scalable Framework for Multi-Graph Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks are typically trained on individual datasets, often requiring highly specialized models and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This dataset-specific approach arises because each graph dataset often has unique node features and diverse connectivity structures, making it difficult to build a generalist model. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable multi-graph multi-task pretraining approach specifically tailored for node classification tasks across diverse graph datasets from different domains. Our method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a Perceiver-based encoder that employs learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a common latent space. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize across different graphs and allows for scaling across diverse data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a model on 152 different graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges, establishing the first set of scaling laws for multi-graph pretraining on datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules, citation and product graphs). Our results show that pretraining on a diverse array of real and synthetic graphs improves the model's adaptability and stability, while performing competitively with state-of-the-art specialist models. This work illustrates that multi-graph pretraining can significantly reduce the burden imposed by the current graph training paradigm, unlocking new capabilities for the field of graph neural networks by creating a single generalist model that performs competitively across a wide range of datasets and tasks.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Advantage of Brokerage in Academia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Science is a collaborative endeavor in which "who collaborates with whom" profoundly influences scientists' career trajectories and success. Despite its relevance, little is known about how scholars facilitate new collaborations among their peers. In this study, we quantify brokerage in academia and study its effect on the careers of physicists worldwide. We find that early-career participation in brokerage increases later-stage involvement for all researchers, with increasing participation rates and greater career impact among more successful scientists. This cumulative advantage process suggests that brokerage contributes to the unequal distribution of success in academia. Surprisingly, this affects both women and men equally, despite women being more junior in all brokerage roles and lagging behind men's participation due to their late and slow arrival to physics. Because of its cumulative nature, promoting brokerage opportunities to early career scientists might help reduce the inequalities in academic success.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of latent inner product recovery via rate distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this largely expository note, we present an impossibility result for inner product recovery in a random geometric graph or latent space model using the rate-distortion theory. More precisely, suppose that we observe a graph $A$ on $n$ vertices with average edge density $p$ generated from Gaussian or spherical latent locations $z_1, \dots, z_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ associated with the $n$ vertices. It is of interest to estimate the inner products $\langle z_i, z_j \rangle$ which represent the geometry of the latent points. We prove that it is impossible to recover the inner products if $d \gtrsim n h(p)$ where $h(p)$ is the binary entropy function. This matches the condition required for positive results on inner product recovery in the literature. The proof follows the well-established rate-distortion theory with the main technical ingredient being a lower bound on the rate-distortion function of the Wishart distribution which is interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>A Small World of Bad Guys: Investigating the Behavior of Hacker Groups in Cyber-Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the behaviour of malicious hacker groups operating in cyberspace and how they organize themselves in structured networks. To better understand these groups, the paper uses Social Network Analysis (SNA) to analyse the interactions and relationships among several malicious hacker groups. The study uses a tested dataset as its primary source, providing an empirical analysis of the cooperative behaviours exhibited by these groups. The study found that malicious hacker groups tend to form close-knit networks where they consult, coordinate with, and assist each other in carrying out their attacks. The study also identified a "small world" phenomenon within the population of malicious actors, which suggests that these groups establish interconnected relationships to facilitate their malicious operations. The small world phenomenon indicates that the actor-groups are densely connected, but they also have a small number of connections to other groups, allowing for efficient communication and coordination of their activities.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of Katz centrality for very dense networks via negative parameter Katz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Katz centrality (and its limiting case, eigenvector centrality) is a frequently used tool to measure the importance of a node in a network, and to rank the nodes accordingly. One reason for its popularity is that Katz centrality can be computed very efficiently when the network is sparse, i.e., having only $O(n)$ edges between its $n$ nodes. While sparsity is common in practice, in some applications one faces the opposite situation of a very dense network, where only $O(n)$ potential edges are missing with respect to a complete graph. We explain why and how, even for very dense networks, it is possible to efficiently compute the ranking stemming from Katz centrality for unweighted graphs, possibly directed and possibly with loops, by working on the complement graph. Our approach also provides an interpretation, regardless of sparsity, of "Katz centrality with negative parameter" as usual Katz centrality on the complement graph. For weighted graphs, we provide instead an approximation method that is based on removing sufficiently many edges from the network (or from its complement), and we give sufficient conditions for this approximation to provide the correct ranking. We include numerical experiments to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>What Is Being Argued (WIBA)? An Application to Legislative Deliberation in the U.S. Congress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we utilize state-of-the-art NLP tools to better understand legislative deliberation? Committee hearings are a core feature of any legislature, and they offer an institutional setting which promotes the exchange of arguments and reasoning that directly impact and shape legislation. We apply What Is Being Argued (WIBA), which is an argument extraction and analysis framework that we previously developed, to U.S. Congressional committee hearings from 2005 to 2023 (109th to 117th Congresses). Then, we further expand WIBA by introducing new ways to quantify various dynamics of democratic deliberation. Specifically, these extensions present a variety of summary statistics capturing how deliberative or controversial a discourse was, as well as useful visualizations to the WIBA output that aid analyzing arguments made during the legislative deliberation. Our application reveals potential biases in the committee system, and how political parties control the flow of information in 'hot topic' hearings.</description>

      <title>An Avalanche of Images on Telegram Preceded Russia's Full-Scale Invasion of Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14947</link>

Abstract: Governments use propaganda, including through visual content -- or Politically Salient Image Patterns (PSIP) -- on social media, to influence and manipulate public opinion. In the present work, we collected Telegram post-history of from 989 Russian milbloggers to better understand the social and political narratives that circulated online in the months surrounding Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Overall, we found an 8,925% increase (p&lt;0.001) in the number of posts and a 5,352% increase (p&lt;0.001) in the number of images posted by these accounts in the two weeks prior to the invasion. We also observed a similar increase in the number and intensity of politically salient manipulated images that circulated on Telegram. Although this paper does not evaluate malice or coordination in these activities, we do conclude with a call for further research into the role that manipulated visual media has in the lead-up to instability events and armed conflict.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Graph Variational Auto-Encoder with Fair Latent Representation to Account for Sampling Bias in Ecological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to represent bipartite networks using graph embeddings tailored to tackle the challenges of studying ecological networks, such as the ones linking plants and pollinators, where many covariates need to be accounted for, in particular to control for sampling bias. We adapt the variational graph auto-encoder approach to the bipartite case, which enables us to generate embeddings in a latent space where the two sets of nodes are positioned based on their probability of connection. We translate the fairness framework commonly considered in sociology in order to address sampling bias in ecology. By incorporating the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as an additional penalty term in the loss we optimize, we ensure that the structure of the latent space is independent of continuous variables, which are related to the sampling process. Finally, we show how our approach can change our understanding of ecological networks when applied to the Spipoll data set, a citizen science monitoring program of plant-pollinator interactions to which many observers contribute, making it prone to sampling bias.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic factors of national representation in the global film festival circuit: skewed toward the large and wealthy, but small countries can beat the odds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes how economic, demographic, and geographic factors predict the representation of different countries in the global film festival circuit. It relies on the combination of several open access datasets, including festival programming information from the Cinando platform of the Cannes Film Market, covering more than 30,000 screenings of over 20,000 films in almost 600 festivals across the world over a decade. It is shown that while the festival screen is indeed dominated by films from large affluent countries, the bias is nevertheless not fully proportional to the large demographic and economic disparities across the world, and that several small countries perform better than expected. It is further analyzed via computational simulations how much including films from smaller countries contributes to cultural diversity, and how countries differ in cultural "trade balance" dynamics, revealing differences between net exporters and importers of festival films. This research underscores the importance of balanced representation in film festivals and the public value of increasing cultural diversity. The data-driven insights and approaches to quantitative festival program and cultural event analytics are hoped to be useful for both the academic community as well as film festival organizers and policymakers aiming to foster more inclusive and diverse cultural landscapes.</description>
