      <title>Fermi surface evolution in Weyl semimetal t-PtBi$_2$ probed by transverse transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of non-trivial topology and superconductivity opens to novel quantum devices. The discovery of intrinsic materials where such properties appear together represents a frontier in modern condensed matter physics. Trigonal PtBi$_2$ has recently emerged as a possible candidate, being the first example of superconducting type-I Weyl semimetal. However, several aspects of this promising compound still need to be unveiled, concerning its complicated band structure, the actual role of Weyl points in determining its electronic properties and the nature of the superconducting transition. In this work, we experimentally investigated a t-PtBi$_2$ single crystal by means of the Hall and Nernst effects. In particular, we revealed a change of regime in its electronic properties, which is compatible with a temperature and magnetic field evolution of hole-like pockets in the Fermi Surface.</description>

      <title>Lattice Quantum Geometry Controlling 118 K Multigap Superconductivity in Heavily Overdoped CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been used to study the thermal structure evolution in CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d (Cu1234), a superconductor which exhibits a high critical temperature (Tc 118 K), high critical current density and large upper critical magnetic field. The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Long-range electron coherence in Kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave-like nature of electrons lies at the core of quantum mechanics, distinguishing them from classical particles. Landmark experiments have revealed phase coherence of mobile electrons within solids, such as Aharonov-Bohm interference in mesoscopic rings. However, this coherence is typically limited by numerous environmental interactions. Controlling and ideally mitigating such decoherence remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic pillars of the Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ for fields applied parallel to the Kagome planes. Their periodicity is independent of materials parameters, simply given by the number of flux quanta $h/e$ threading between adjacent Kagome layers akin to an atomic-scale Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Intriguingly they occur under conditions not favorable for typical interference in solids, at temperatures above 20 K and in micrometer-scale devices well exceeding the single-particle mean free path. Further, the oscillations exhibit non-analytic field-angle dependence and scale consistently with a broad range of key electronic responses in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, pointing to a cooperative mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. Our findings provide new insights into the debated origin of correlated order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and establish Kagome metals as a promising platform for interaction-stabilized long-range electron coherence - crucial for both fundamental studies and technological advancements in quantum interference in metallic systems.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependent ab initio study of the physical properties of hexagonal BeB2C: a possible high-Tc superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses the Density Functional Theory to explore the pressure dependent properties of hexagonal BeB2C. The metallic nature of BeB2C was substantiated at ambient pressure, with pressure induced alterations in electronic band structure and Fermi surface topology suggesting a potential for tunability across various applications. The phonon dispersion and phonon density of states show the dynamical stability under pressure. The thermophysical properties are also investigated under varying pressure conditions. Finally, the exploration of superconducting properties found that the transition temperature is in good agreement with previously reported values, and illustrated that beB2C holds considerable promise as a high-temperature superconductor, with pressure augmenting its superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring Charge Density Waves in two-dimensional NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) has garnered attention due to the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) down to the monolayer limit. However, realistic modeling of CDWs-accounting for effects such as layer number, twist angle, and strain-remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of first-principles methods. To address this, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), based on the Allegro architecture-an E(3)-equivariant model -- specifically tailored to capture subtle CDW effects in NbSe$_2$. These MLIPs enable efficient exploration of commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, as well as the dimensional dependence of the transition temperature, evaluated using the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). Our findings reveal a strong sensitivity of CDWs to stacking and layer number, and a slight suppression of the transition temperature with increasing thickness. This work opens new possibilities for studying and tuning CDWs in NbSe$_2$ and other 2D systems, with implications for electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, and advanced materials design.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of the Josephson junction between finite islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits comprising Josephson junctions have spurred significant research activity due to their promise to realize scalable quantum computers. Effective Hamiltonians for these systems have traditionally been derived assuming the junction connects superconducting islands of infinite size. We derive a quantized Hamiltonian for a Josephson junction between finite-sized islands and predict measurable corrections to the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility to test the theory.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Josephson supercurrent diode effect induced by chiral spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral materials lacking mirror symmetry can exhibit unconventional spin-orbit fields, including fully momentum-aligned radial Rashba fields as seen in twisted van der Waals homobilayers. We theoretically study Cooper-pair transfer in superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions with crossed (tangential and radial) interfacial Rashba fields. We find that their interplay leads to what we call the unconventional supercurrent diode effect (SDE), where supercurrent rectification occurs even with collinear (with respect to the current) barrier magnetization, not possible for conventional spin-orbit fields. This SDE, distinct from conventional Rashba-induced effects on Cooper-pair momenta, arises from the spin precession in the magnetic barrier. We propose it as a sensitive probe of chiral spin textures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Predictions of MB5N5: Atom-Stuffed Boronitride Clathrate Cages Derived from the High-Pressure Superhydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates 198 MX5Y5 (X, Y = B, C, or N) clathrate-like structures derived from MH10 superhydrides using high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) geometry optimizations and phonon calculations. A wide variety of electropositive and electronegative encapsulated atoms were considered. From all of the studied systems only 34 MB5N5 phases were found to be dynamically stable at ambient pressure. The highest 1-atmosphere superconducting critical transition temperature was predicted for FB5N5. However, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all of the identified superconducting phases decompose by 300~K at 1~atm, while only eleven semiconducting phases remained thermally stable. Our findings underscore the critical role of kinetic and thermal stability in predicting viable superconductors. The electronic structure of the MB5N5 compounds were rationalized in terms of electron donating and withdrawing intercalants, and machine-learning based predictions of their mechanical properties were compared with those of an empty boronitride cage.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations, and their connection to the higher temperature pseudogap metal. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the pseudogap `Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial aluminum layer on antimonide heterostructures for exploring Josephson junction effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present results of our recent work of epitaxially-grown aluminum (epi-Al) on antimonide heterostructures, where the epi-Al thin film is grown at either room temperature or below zero $^o$C. A sharp superconducting transition at $T \sim 1.3$ K is observed in these epi-Al films. We further show that supercurrent states are realized in Josephson junctions fabricated in the epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures with mobility $\mu \sim 1.0 \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs. These results clearly demonstrate we have achieved growing high-quality epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures, a promising platform for the exploration of Josephson junction effects for quantum information science and microelectronics applications.</description>
