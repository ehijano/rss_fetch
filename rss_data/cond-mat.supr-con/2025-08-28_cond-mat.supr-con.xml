      <title>Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with four Majorana zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors is $\varphi=\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity and mass enhancement near CDW critical point based on Bethe-Salpeter equation method: application to cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, charge-channel orders in strongly correlated metals have attracted great attention. Famous examples are the electronic nematic orders in cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and Star-of-David order in kagome metals. Critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity arising from fluctuations of such charge-channel orders are central issues today; however, the essential role is played by the vertex corrections, which are the many-body effects that are dropped in conventional mean-field type approximations. To solve this difficulty, in this study, we propose the Bethe-Salpeter equation theory to evaluate electron-electron interactions in two dimensional Hubbard models. This method satisfies the criteria of the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge channel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the interference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the square-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive charge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave superconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results naturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where strong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order quantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard models, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad potential for future applications.</description>

      <title>Multiband Superconductivity and High Critical Current Density in Entropy Stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High and medium-entropy superconductors with significant intrinsic disorder are a fascinating class of superconductors. Their combination of robust structural integrity, superior mechanical properties, and exceptional irradiation tolerance makes them promising candidates for use in advanced superconducting technologies. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation on the superconductivity of equiatomic entropy-stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25. The material shows bulk superconductivity (transition temperature = 8K) with a high upper critical field of 11.94T. Interestingly, both the electronic band structure and specific heat data point toward unconventional multiband superconductivity. Our ab initio calculations reveal Dirac-like band crossings close to the Fermi level, with certain degeneracies persisting even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, suggesting a possible interplay between topological electronic states and the observed unconventional superconductivity. Remarkably, the critical current density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously reported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current density is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries, facilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion. Taken together, the demonstrated dynamical stability, excellent metallicity, potential to host unconventional superconductivity, and exceptionally high critical current density highlight the potential of entropy-stabilized alloys as a platform for exploring the confluence of disorder, topology, and unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of thermodynamically stable hydrides. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of $T_{\rm c}$. Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic thermodynamically stable hydrides with $T_{\rm c}$ above 4.2 K and reach a maximum $T_{\rm c}$ of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of a one-dimensional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases $\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic chamber setup for superfluid helium experiments with optical fiber and electrical access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid helium is a prototypical quantum liquid. As such, it has been a prominent platform for the study of quantum many body physics. More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research.</description>

      <title>Effects of background rotation and anisotropy in the holographic description of type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work concerns the detailed construction of a holographic model for a type-II s-wave superconductor defined on a 5-dimensional anisotropic rotating black hole. We examine the role of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of the superconductor model focusing on the condensate and the AC conductivity, for which we obtain closed formulas, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results reveal that the rotation is responsible for the appearance of a peak and for introducing an exponentially vanishing behavior in the high-frequency limit of the real component of the AC conductivity. Such a behavior aligns with that observed in high-temperature superconductor models and experiments, where the peak and vanishing behavior result from quasiparticle damping, suggesting a relation between the {\it rotation of a black hole} and {\it quasiparticle damping effects} due to impurities or defects in a superconducting material. This relation supplements the holographic dictionary of the gravity/Condensed Matter Theory correspondence. In addition, we provide a detailed construction of the vortex lattice presented in arXiv:2208.05988 and study its behavior as a function of an external uniform magnetic field. Once again, it is shown that the vortex lattice can be continuously deformed along with a change in the vortex population by virtue of the magnetic field, providing a promising avenue for holographically modeling the vortex lattice deformations observed in experimental studies with superconducting materials. As a concrete example, we describe both the vortex lattice deformation and the increment of the vortex population under the action of an external magnetic field in the LiFeAs type-II superconductor. These effects supplement those previously found for the FeSe type-II superconductor studied in arXiv:2208.05988.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>
