      <title>On the gradient of a monomial ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, let $I \subset S = K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be a homogeneous ideal, and let $\partial(I)$ be its gradient ideal. We study the relationship between $\mathrm{reg}\,I$ and $\mathrm{reg}\,\partial(I)$. While earlier work by Bus\'e, Dimca, Schenck, and Sticlaru showed these regularities are generally incomparable for hypersurface ideals, we prove they remain incomparable even for monomial ideals with linear resolution, answering a question of J. Herzog. In fact, for any integers $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \ge - 1$, we construct monomial ideals $I$ and $J$ such that $\mathrm{reg}\,I - \mathrm{reg}\,\partial(I) = a$, $\mathrm{reg}\,\partial(J) - \mathrm{reg}\,J = b$ and $J$ has linear resolution. We introduce monomial ideals with differential linear resolution as those monomial ideals whose all iterated gradient ideals have linear resolution. We prove that polymatroidal ideals, equigenerated (strongly) stable ideals, powers of edge ideals with linear resolution, complementary edge ideals with linear resolution, and certain equigenerated squarefree monomial ideals with many generators satisfy this property.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to curvature of modules over Cohen-Macaulay rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with residue field $k$. If $M$ is a finitely generated $A$-module then set $\text{curv}(M) = \limsup_n\sqrt[n]{\beta_n^A(M)}$. We show that under mild hypotheses the existence of a single module $M$ with $1 \leq \text{curv}(M) &lt; \text{curv}(k)$ imposes obstructions to both $\text{curv}(k)$ and $\text{curv}(M)$. Similarly we show that the condition $\text{Tor}^A_n(M, N) = 0$ for $n \gg 0$ imposes constraints on both $\text{curv}(M)$ and $\text{curv}(N)$.</description>

      <title>From Polynomials to Databases: Arithmetic Structures in Galois Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a computational framework for classifying Galois groups of irreducible degree-7 polynomials over~$\mathbb{Q}$, combining explicit resolvent methods with machine learning techniques. A database of over one million normalized projective septics is constructed, each annotated with algebraic invariants~$J_0, \dots, J_4$ derived from binary transvections. For each polynomial, we compute resolvent factorizations to determine its Galois group among the seven transitive subgroups of~$S_7$ identified by Foulkes. Using this dataset, we train a neurosymbolic classifier that integrates invariant-theoretic features with supervised learning, yielding improved accuracy in detecting rare solvable groups compared to coefficient-based models. The resulting database provides a reproducible resource for constructive Galois theory and supports empirical investigations into group distribution under height constraints. The methodology extends to higher-degree cases and illustrates the utility of hybrid symbolic-numeric techniques in computational algebra.</description>

      <title>Debordering Closure Results in Determinantal and Pfaffian Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One important question in algebraic complexity is understanding the complexity of polynomial ideals (Grochow, Bulletin of EATCS 131, 2020). Andrews and Forbes (STOC 2022) studied the determinantal ideals $I^{\det}_{n,m,r}$ generated by the $r\times r$ minors of $n\times m$ matrices. Over fields of characteristic zero or of sufficiently large characteristic, they showed that for any nonzero $f \in I^{\det}_{n,m,r}$, the determinant of a $t \times t$ matrix of variables with $t = \Theta(r^{1/3})$ is approximately computed by a constant-depth, polynomial-size $f$-oracle algebraic circuit, in the sense that the determinant lies in the border of such circuits. An analogous result was also obtained for Pfaffians in the same paper.
  In this work, we deborder the result of Andrews and Forbes by showing that when $f$ has polynomial degree, the determinant is in fact exactly computed by a constant-depth, polynomial-size $f$-oracle algebraic circuit. We further establish an analogous result for Pfaffian ideals.
  Our results are established using the isolation lemma, combined with a careful analysis of straightening-law expansions of polynomials in determinantal and Pfaffian ideals.</description>

      <title>The separating Noether number of small groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper completes the computation of the separating Noether numbers for the groups with order strictly less than $32$. Most of the results are proved for the case of a general (possibly finite) base field containing an element whose multiplicative order equals the size of the group.</description>

      <title>Support-2 monomial ideals that are Simis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A monomial ideal $I\subseteq \mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots , x_n]$ is called a Simis ideal if $I^{(s)}=I^s$ for all $s\geq 1$, where $I^{(s)}$ denotes the $s$-th symbolic power of $I$. Let $I$ be a support-2 monomial ideal such that its irreducible primary decomposition is minimal. We prove that $I$ is a Simis ideal if and only if $\sqrt{I}$ is Simis and $I$ has standard linear weights. This result thereby proves a recent conjecture for the class of support-2 monomial ideals proposed by Mendez, Pinto, and Villarreal. Furthermore, we give a complete characterization of the Cohen-Macaulay property for support-2 monomial ideals whose radical is the edge ideal of a whiskered graph. Finally, we classify when these ideals are Simis in degree 2.</description>

      <title>On semi-transitional and transitional rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study two new classes of commutative rings, namely semi transitional rings and transitional rings, which extend several classical ideas arising from rings of continuous functions and their variants. A general framework for these rings is developed through the notion of semi transition and transition maps, leading to a systematic exploration of their algebraic and topological properties. Structural results concerning product rings, localizations, and pm rings are established, showing that these new classes naturally generalize familiar examples such as polynomial rings over fields, rings of bounded continuous functions, and the ring of admissible ideal convergent real sequences. Ideals and filters induced by semi transition maps are analyzed to characterize prime and maximal ideals, revealing a duality between algebraic and set-theoretic constructions. Furthermore, conditions under which semi transitional rings become semiprimitive are determined, and a Stone Cech like compactification is constructed for transitional rings, giving rise to a new perspective on unique extension properties in topological algebra.</description>
