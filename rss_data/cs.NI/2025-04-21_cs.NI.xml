      <title>Cellular-X: An LLM-empowered Cellular Agent for Efficient Base Station Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Cellular-X, an LLM-powered agent designed to automate cellular base station (BS) maintenance. Leveraging multimodal LLM and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, Cellular-X significantly enhances field engineer efficiency by quickly interpreting user intents, retrieving relevant technical information, and configuring a BS through iterative self-correction. Key features of the demo include automatic customized BS setup, document-based query answering, and voice-controlled configuration reporting and revision. We implemented Cellular-X on a USRP X310 testbed for demonstration. Demo videos and implementation details are available at https://github.com/SeaBreezing/Cellular-X.</description>

      <title>HEAT:History-Enhanced Dual-phase Actor-Critic Algorithm with A Shared Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a single-gateway LoRaWAN network, this study proposed a history-enhanced two-phase actor-critic algorithm with a shared transformer algorithm (HEAT) to improve network performance. HEAT considers uplink parameters and often neglected downlink parameters, and effectively integrates offline and online reinforcement learning, using historical data and real-time interaction to improve model performance. In addition, this study developed an open source LoRaWAN network simulator LoRaWANSim. The simulator considers the demodulator lock effect and supports multi-channel, multi-demodulator and bidirectional communication. Simulation experiments show that compared with the best results of all compared algorithms, HEAT improves the packet success rate and energy efficiency by 15% and 95%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-Gateway LoRaWAN via Cloud-Edge Collaboration and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For large-scale multi-gateway LoRaWAN networks, this study proposes a cloud-edge collaborative resource allocation and decision-making method based on edge intelligence, HEAT-LDL (HEAT-Local Distill Lyapunov), which realizes collaborative decision-making between gateways and terminal nodes. HEAT-LDL combines the Actor-Critic architecture and the Lyapunov optimization method to achieve intelligent downlink control and gateway load balancing. When the signal quality is good, the network server uses the HEAT algorithm to schedule the terminal nodes. To improve the efficiency of autonomous decision-making of terminal nodes, HEAT-LDL performs cloud-edge knowledge distillation on the HEAT teacher model on the terminal node side. When the downlink decision instruction is lost, the terminal node uses the student model and the edge decider based on prior knowledge and local history to make collaborative autonomous decisions. Simulation experiments show that compared with the optimal results of all compared algorithms, HEAT-LDL improves the packet success rate and energy efficiency by 20.5% and 88.1%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Automated Taxi Booking Operations for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a conventional taxi booking system, all taxi operations are mostly done by a decision made by drivers which is hard to implement in unmanned vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce a taxi booking system which assists autonomous vehicles to pick up customers. The system can allocate an autonomous vehicle (AV) as well as plan service trips for a customer request. We use our own AV to serve a customer who uses a mobile application to make his taxi request. Apart from customer and AV, we build a server to monitor customers and AVs. It also supports inter-communication between a customer and an AV once AV decided to pick up a customer.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Handover Parameter Optimization with MARL for Load Balancing in 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cellular networks, cell handover refers to the process where a device switches from one base station to another, and this mechanism is crucial for balancing the load among different cells. Traditionally, engineers would manually adjust parameters based on experience. However, the explosive growth in the number of cells has rendered manual tuning impractical. Existing research tends to overlook critical engineering details in order to simplify handover problems. In this paper, we classify cell handover into three types, and jointly model their mutual influence. To achieve load balancing, we propose a multi-agent-reinforcement-learning (MARL)-based scheme to automatically optimize the parameters. To reduce the agent interaction costs, a distributed training is implemented based on consensus approximation of global average load, and it is shown that the approximation error is bounded. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme outperforms existing benchmarks in balancing load and improving network performance.</description>

      <title>SFL-LEO: Asynchronous Split-Federated Learning Design for LEO Satellite-Ground Network Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the rapid development of LEO satellite networks spurs another widespread concern-data processing at satellites. However, achieving efficient computation at LEO satellites in highly dynamic satellite networks is challenging and remains an open problem when considering the constrained computation capability of LEO satellites. For the first time, we propose a novel distributed learning framework named SFL-LEO by combining Federated Learning (FL) with Split Learning (SL) to accommodate the high dynamics of LEO satellite networks and the constrained computation capability of LEO satellites by leveraging the periodical orbit traveling feature. The proposed scheme allows training locally by introducing an asynchronous training strategy, i.e., achieving local update when LEO satellites disconnect with the ground station, to provide much more training space and thus increase the training performance. Meanwhile, it aggregates client-side sub-models at the ground station and then distributes them to LEO satellites by borrowing the idea from the federated learning scheme. Experiment results driven by satellite-ground bandwidth measured in Starlink demonstrate that SFL-LEO provides a similar accuracy performance with the conventional SL scheme because it can perform local training even within the disconnection duration.</description>

      <title>Towards End-to-End Network Intent Management with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a key role in Intent-Based Networking (IBN) as they show remarkable performance in interpreting human language as well as code generation, enabling the translation of high-level intents expressed by humans into low-level network configurations. In this paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro, ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks (RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F), explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can achieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the closed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all users.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Controller Placement and Switch Assignment in SDN-based LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software-defined networking (SDN) based low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks leverage the SDN's benefits of the separation of data plane and control plane, control plane programmability, and centralized control to alleviate the problem of inefficient resource management under traditional network architectures. The most fundamental issue in SDN-based LEO satellite networks is how to place controllers and assign switches. Their outcome directly affects the performance of the network. However, most existing strategies can not sensibly and dynamically adjust the controller location and controller-switch mapping according to the topology variation and traffic undulation of the LEO satellite network meanwhile. In this paper, based on the dynamic placement dynamic assignment scheme, we first formulate the controller placement and switch assignment (CPSA) problem in the LEO satellite networks, which is an integer nonlinear programming problem. Then, a prior population-based genetic algorithm is proposed to solve it. Some individuals of the final generation of the algorithm for the current time slot are used as the prior population of the next time slot, thus stringing together the algorithms of adjacent time slots for successive optimization. Finally, we obtain the near-optimal solution for each time slot. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can adapt to the network topology changes and traffic surges, and outperform some existing CPSA strategies in the LEO satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum repeaters enhanced by vacuum beam guides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Graph Attention for Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Lightpath Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many works have investigated reinforcement learning (RL) for routing and spectrum assignment on flex-grid networks but only one work to date has examined RL for fixed-grid with flex-rate transponders, despite production systems using this paradigm. Flex-rate transponders allow existing lightpaths to accommodate new services, a task we term routing and wavelength assignment with lightpath reuse (RWA-LR). We re-examine this problem and present a thorough benchmarking of heuristic algorithms for RWA-LR, which are shown to have 6% increased throughput when candidate paths are ordered by number of hops, rather than total length. We train an RL agent for RWA-LR with graph attention networks for the policy and value functions to exploit the graph-structured data. We provide details of our methodology and open source all of our code for reproduction. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art RL approach by 2.5% (17.4 Tbps mean additional throughput) and the best heuristic by 1.2% (8.5 Tbps mean additional throughput). This marginal gain highlights the difficulty in learning effective RL policies on long horizon resource allocation tasks.</description>

      <title>SigChord: Sniffing Wide Non-sparse Multiband Signals for Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While unencrypted information inspection in physical layer (e.g., open headers) can provide deep insights for optimizing wireless networks, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods heavily depend on full sampling rate (a.k.a Nyquist rate), and high-cost radios, due to terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks densely occupying multiple bands across large bandwidth (e.g., from 4G/5G at 0.4-7 GHz to LEO satellite at 4-40 GHz). To this end, we present SigChord, an efficient physical layer inspection system built on low-cost and sub-Nyquist sampling radios. We first design a deep and rule-based interleaving algorithm based on Transformer network to perform spectrum sensing and signal recovery under sub-Nyquist sampling rate, and second, cascade protocol identifier and decoder based on Transformer neural networks to help physical layer packets analysis. We implement SigChord using software-defined radio platforms, and extensively evaluate it on over-the-air terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless signals. The experiments demonstrate that SigChord delivers over 99% accuracy in detecting and decoding, while still decreasing 34% sampling rate, compared with the SOTA approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Federated Multi-Armed Bandit Learning for Content Dissemination using Swarm of UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.</description>
