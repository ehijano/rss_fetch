      <title>The ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of $8_{18}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knot $8_{18}$ is the first non-arborescent hyperbolic knot. In 2020, Paoluzzi and Porti found its ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety with the aid of a computer, but many details were omitted.
  In this paper, we determine the character variety by a software-free procedure, which is easy to follow and enlightening.
  Along the way, we develop an efficient method for working with simultaneous conjugacy classes of four elements of ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>Lipshitz--Sarkar stable homotopy type for certain planar trivalent graphs with perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a space-level refinement of the $2$-factor homology by constructing a stable homotopy type associated to a certain family $\mathscr{G}$ of planar trivalent graphs equipped with perfect matchings. Specifically, we define a cover functor from the $2$-factor flow category $\mathscr{C}(\Gamma_{M})$ to the cube flow category $\mathscr{C}_{C}(n)$, where the perfect matching graph $\Gamma_{M}$ represents a planar trivalent graph $G$ together with a perfect matching $M$, such that $(G,M) \in \mathscr{G}$. By applying the Cohen--Jones--Segal realization to the $2$-factor flow category $\mathscr{C}(\Gamma_{M})$, we obtain the $2$-factor spectrum. This spectrum serves as a space-level version of the $2$-factor homology, analogous to the Lipshitz--Sarkar Khovanov spectrum for links. We show that the cohomology of the $2$-factor spectrum with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-coefficients is isomorphic to the $2$-factor homology, as defined by Baldridge. We prove that the stable homotopy type of the $2$-factor spectrum is an invariant of planar trivalent graphs $G$ equipped with perfect matchings $M$, whenever $(G, M) \in \mathscr{G}$. Furthermore, we show that the closed webs obtained by performing flattenings at each crossing of an oriented link diagram in the context of $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ link homology belong to the family $\mathscr{G}$.</description>

      <title>The Euler Class and Flux Homomorphisms under Non-Orientability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an orientable surface with an area form, there are two invariants of area-preserving dynamics, the flux homomorphism and the Calabi invariant. Tsuboi found a remarkable connection between the Calabi invariant on the closed disk and a topological invariant -- the Euler class. In this paper, we investigate a relationship between the Euler class and the flux homomorphism for non-orientable compact surfaces with one boundary component. Furthermore, we prove the simplicity of the kernel of the flux homomorphisms in this non-orientable setting, which implies the non-existence of invariants analogous to the Calabi invariant.</description>

      <title>Manhattan curves in complex dynamics and asymptotic correlation of multiplier spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Manhattan curve for a pair of hyperbolic structures (possibly with cusps) on a given surface is a geometric object that encodes the growth rate of lengths of closed geodesics with respect to the two different hyperbolic metrics. It has been extensively studied as a way to understand geodesics on surfaces, the thermodynamic formalism of the geodesic flows and comparison of hyperbolic metrics.
  Via Sullivan's dictionary, in this paper, we define and study the Manhattan curve for a pair of hyperbolic rational maps on $\mathbb C\mathbb P^1$, and more generally of holomorphic endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^k$. We discuss several counting results for the multiplier spectrum and show that the Manhattan curve for two holomorphic endomorphisms is related to the correlation number of their multiplier spectra.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of Brunnian links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.12637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new techniques to show hyperbolicity of links based on geometric/combinatorial topology. Our techniques are applicable to links that have at least one unknotted component. In particular, they are applicable to Brunnian links. We illustrate our techniques on many examples of Brunnian links. In fact, we determine hyperbolicity for all Brunnian links found in literature. In particular, we discover many infinite families of hyperbolic Brunnian links.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two main theorems: conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations, especially in higher rank. Both theorems are new even for relatively Anosov groups.
  First, we establish a higher rank extension of rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia, Yue, and Kim-Oh for representations of rank one discrete subgroups of divergence type, in terms of the push-forwards of conformal measures via boundary maps. We consider a certain class of higher rank discrete subgroups, which we call hypertransverse subgroups. It includes all rank one discrete subgroups, Anosov subgroups, relatively Anosov subgroups, and their subgroups. Our proof of the rigidity theorem generalizes the idea of Kim-Oh to self-joinings of higher rank hypertransverse subgroups, overcoming the lack of $\mathrm{CAT}(-1)$ geometry on symmetric spaces. In contrast to the work of Sullivan, Tukia, and Yue, our argument is closely related to the study of horospherical foliations.
  We also show the ergodicity of horospherical foliations with respect to Burger-Roblin measures. This generalizes the classical work of Hedlund, Burger, and Roblin in rank one and of Lee-Oh for Borel Ansov subgroups in higher rank. Moreover, we describe the ergodic decomposition of Burger-Roblin measures and Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measures when a given parabolic subgroup is minimal.</description>

      <title>Spinal open books and symplectic fillings with exotic fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinal open book decompositions provide a natural generalization of open book decompositions. We show that any minimal symplectic filling of a contact 3-manifold supported by a planar spinal open book is deformation equivalent to the complement of a positive multisection in a bordered Lefschetz fibration, which generalizes a result of Wendl. Along the way, we give an explicit local model for a non-compactly supported "singularity at infinity" in a generalized version of bordered Lefschetz fibrations, given by pseudoholomorphic foliations associated to the spinal open books. This provides new tools to classify symplectic fillings of a contact 3-manifold that is not supported by an amenable spinal open book, by studying monodromy factorizations in the newly defined spinal mapping class group. As an application, we complete the classification of strong fillings of all parabolic torus bundles, and make progress towards classifying symplectic fillings of contact 3-manifolds supported by non-planar open books.</description>

      <title>The embedding space of a Hopf link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the unparametrised smooth embedding space of a Hopf link in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and prove that it is homotopy equivalent to the closed 3-manifold $S^3/\mathbb{Q}_8$. As an intermediate step in the proof, we show that the inclusion of the subspace of round embeddings is a homotopy equivalence. We provide analogous results for the unparametrised smooth embedding space of a Hopf link in $S^3$, which we show is homotopy equivalent to $\mathbb{R} P^2\times \mathbb{R} P^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed simply connected $7$-manifold. In this paper we establish homotopy decompositions of the reduced suspension space $\Sigma M$ into a wedge sum of simpler spaces when localized at a set of primes. These decompositions are applied to study the cohomotopy sets $\pi^k(M)$ and the $p$-local cohomotopy sets $\pi^4(M;\mathbb{Z}_{(p)})$.</description>

      <title>The boundary of bordified Outer space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary of the "Jewel space" $\mathcal J_n$ constructed in arXiv:1709.01296. This is an equivariant deformation retract of Outer space $CV_n$ on which $Out(F_n)$ acts properly and cocompactly, and is homeomorphic to the Bestvina-Feighn bordification of $CV_n$. In the current paper we analyze the structure of the boundary of $\mathcal J_n$. We then use the desctiption of the simplicial closure $CV_n^*$ as the sphere complex of a connected sum of $n$ copies of $S^1\times S^2$ to prove that this boundary is homotopy equivalent to the subcomplex of $CV_n^*$ spanned by vertices at infinity.</description>
