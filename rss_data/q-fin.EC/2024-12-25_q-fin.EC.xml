      <title>Emergent poverty traps and inequality at multiple levels impedes social mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eradicating extreme poverty and inequality are the key leverage points to achieve the seventeen Sustainable Development goals. Yet, the reduction in extreme poverty and inequality are vulnerable to shocks such as the pandemic and climate change. We find that that these vulnerabilities emerge from the interaction between individual and institutional mechanisms. Individual characteristics like risk aversion, attention, and saving propensity can lead to sub-optimal diversification and low capital accumulation. These individual drivers are reinforced by institutional mechanisms such as lack of financial inclusion, access to technology, and economic segregation, leading to persistent inequality and poverty traps. Our experiments demonstrate that addressing above factors yields 'double dividend' - reducing poverty and inequality within-and-between communities and create positive feedback that can withstand shocks.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Discovery, and Product Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of artificial intelligence on innovation, exploiting the randomized introduction of a new materials discovery technology to 1,018 scientists in the R&amp;D lab of a large U.S. firm. AI-assisted researchers discover 44% more materials, resulting in a 39% increase in patent filings and a 17% rise in downstream product innovation. These compounds possess more novel chemical structures and lead to more radical inventions. However, the technology has strikingly disparate effects across the productivity distribution: while the bottom third of scientists see little benefit, the output of top researchers nearly doubles. Investigating the mechanisms behind these results, I show that AI automates 57% of "idea-generation" tasks, reallocating researchers to the new task of evaluating model-produced candidate materials. Top scientists leverage their domain knowledge to prioritize promising AI suggestions, while others waste significant resources testing false positives. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of AI-augmented research and highlight the complementarity between algorithms and expertise in the innovative process. Survey evidence reveals that these gains come at a cost, however, as 82% of scientists report reduced satisfaction with their work due to decreased creativity and skill underutilization.</description>

      <title>The Value of AI-Generated Metadata for UGC Platforms: Evidence from a Large-scale Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC), such as advertisement copy, product descriptions, and social media posts, is becoming ubiquitous in business practices. However, the value of AI-generated metadata, such as titles, remains unclear on user-generated content (UGC) platforms. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale field experiment on a leading short-video platform in Asia to provide about 1 million users access to AI-generated titles for their uploaded videos. Our findings show that the provision of AI-generated titles significantly boosted content consumption, increasing valid watches by 1.6% and watch duration by 0.9%. When producers adopted these titles, these increases jumped to 7.1% and 4.1%, respectively. This viewership-boost effect was largely attributed to the use of this generative AI (GAI) tool increasing the likelihood of videos having a title by 41.4%. The effect was more pronounced for groups more affected by metadata sparsity. Mechanism analysis revealed that AI-generated metadata improved user-video matching accuracy in the platform's recommender system. Interestingly, for a video for which the producer would have posted a title anyway, adopting the AI-generated title decreased its viewership on average, implying that AI-generated titles may be of lower quality than human-generated ones. However, when producers chose to co-create with GAI and significantly revised the AI-generated titles, the videos outperformed their counterparts with either fully AI-generated or human-generated titles, showcasing the benefits of human-AI co-creation. This study highlights the value of AI-generated metadata and human-AI metadata co-creation in enhancing user-content matching and content consumption for UGC platforms.</description>

      <title>ORAN Drives Higher Returns on Investments in Urban and Suburban Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first incentive analysis of open radio access networks (ORAN) using game theory. We assess strategic interactions between telecom supply chain stakeholders: mobile network operators (MNOs), network infrastructure suppliers (NIS), and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) across three procurement scenarios: (i) Traditional, (ii) Predatory as monolithic radio access networks (MRAN), and (iii) DirectOEM as ORAN. We use random forest and gradient boosting models to evaluate the optimal margins across urban, suburban, and rural U.S. regions. Results suggest that ORAN deployment consistently demonstrates higher net present value (NPV) of profits in urban and suburban regions, outperforming the traditional procurement strategy by 11% to 31%. However, rural areas present lower NPVs across all scenarios, with significant variability at the county level. This analysis offers actionable insights for telecom investment strategies, bridging technical innovation with economic outcomes and addressing strategic supply chain dynamics through a game-theoretic lens.</description>

      <title>A physics-engineering-economic model coupling approach for estimating the socio-economic impacts of space weather scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing concern about our vulnerability to space weather hazards and the disruption critical infrastructure failures could cause to society and the economy. However, the socio-economic impacts of space weather hazards, such as from geomagnetic storms, remain under-researched. This study introduces a novel framework to estimate the economic impacts of electricity transmission infrastructure failure due to space weather. By integrating existing geophysical and geomagnetically induced current (GIC) estimation models with a newly developed geospatial model of the Continental United States power grid, GIC vulnerabilities are assessed for a range of space weather scenarios. The approach evaluates multiple power network architectures, incorporating input-output economic modeling to translate business and population disruptions into macroeconomic impacts from GIC-related thermal heating failures. The results indicate a daily GDP loss from 6 billion USD to over 10 billion USD. Even under conservative GIC thresholds (75 A/ph) aligned with thermal withstand limits from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), significant economic disruptions are evident. This study is limited by its restriction to thermal heating analysis, though GICs can also affect the grid through other pathways, such as voltage instability and harmonic distortions. Addressing these other failure mechanisms need to be the focus of future research.</description>

      <title>The contribution of US broadband infrastructure subsidy and investment programs to GDP using input-output modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02431v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than one-fifth of the US population does not subscribe to a fixed broadband service despite broadband being a recognized merit good. For example, less than 4% of citizens earning more than US \$70k annually do not have broadband, compared to 26% of those earning below US \$20k annually. To address this, the federal government has undertaken one of the largest broadband investment programs ever via The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, with the aim of addressing this disparity and expanding broadband connectivity to all citizens. We examine broadband availability, adoption, and need for each US state, and then construct an Input-Output model to explore the potential structural macroeconomic impacts of broadband spending on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and supply chain linkages. In terms of macroeconomic impact, the total potential indirect contribution to US GDP by the program could be as high as US \$84.8 billion, \$32.7 billion, and \$9.78 billion for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, the Affordable Connectivity Program, and additional programs, respectively. Thus, overall, the broadband allocations could expand US GDP by up to US \$127.3 billion (0.10% of annual US GDP over the next five years). Moreover, the broadband packages within the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law could create up to 230,000 jobs (0.14% labor market increase). We contribute one of the first economic impact assessments of the US Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to the literature.</description>
