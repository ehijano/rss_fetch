      <title>Observations of high-frequency spectral peaks from in-situ waves in ice data: evidence for nonlinear waves in ice triad interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of waves through the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and deeper into pack ice is a key phenomenon that influences the breakup and drift of sea ice. When waves in ice propagate through a solid, non-cracked, thick enough sea ice cover, significant flexural elastic effects can be present in the dispersion relation. This results in a dispersion relation that opens up for 3-wave interactions, also known as wave triads.
  Here, we report the observation of high-frequency spectral peaks in the power spectral density of waves in ice spectra. We show, in two timeseries datasets, that the presence of these high-frequency peaks is accompanied by high values for the spectral bicoherence. This is a signature that the high-frequency peak is phase-locked with frequency components in the main spectral energy peak, and a necessary condition for nonlinear coupling to take place. Moreover, we show for a timeseries dataset that includes several closely located sensors that the dispersion relation recovered from a cross-spectrum analysis is compatible with the possible existence of wave triads at the same frequencies for which the bicoherence peak is observed. In addition to these observations in timeseries datasets, we show that similar high-frequency peaks are observed from additional, independent datasets of waves in ice power spectrum densities transmitted over iridium from autonomous buoys.
  These results suggest that nonlinear energy transfers between wave in ice spectral components are likely to occur in some waves and sea ice conditions. This may enable redistribution of energy from weakly damped low-frequency waves to more strongly attenuated higher-frequency spectral components, which can contribute to energy dissipation in the ice.</description>

      <title>Reduced model for deep bed filtration of binary highly heterogeneous colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyper-exponential retention profiles (HERPs) are often observed during laboratory tests on colloidal and nano-suspension transport in porous media. The aim of this work is an extension of the traditional model for suspended particle transport (deep bed filtration) to match HERPs. Interpreting particle capture in the framework of active mass law for the "chemical reaction" particle-rock, we substitute suspension concentration in the traditional expression for capture rate by non-linear "activity" function, called the suspension function. The non-linear suspension function is derived from Margules' activity model for excess Gibbs free energy. This suspension function is shown to match that derived from multicomponent colloidal transport with good agreement, despite having one less unknown parameter. Empirical formulae are presented to convert between the two unknown parameters of the multicomponent model and the Margules exponent. Comparison between the new model and laboratory coreflooding data shows good agreement, even in cases with distinctly hyper-exponential retention profiles, where the classical model fails to reproduce the laboratory data.</description>

      <title>Ambient Noise Full Waveform Inversion with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation are crucial for investigating velocity structures and improving seismic hazard assessment. However, standard methods such as finite difference or finite element are computationally expensive. Recent studies have shown that a new class of machine learning models, called neural operators, can solve the elastodynamic wave equation orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Full waveform inversion is a prime beneficiary of the accelerated simulations. Neural operators, as end-to-end differentiable operators, combined with automatic differentiation, provide an alternative approach to the adjoint-state method. State-of-the-art optimization techniques built into PyTorch provide neural operators with greater flexibility to improve the optimization dynamics of full waveform inversion, thereby mitigating cycle-skipping problems. In this study, we demonstrate the first application of neural operators for full waveform inversion on a real seismic dataset, which consists of several nodal transects collected across the San Gabriel, Chino, and San Bernardino basins in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium distribution of the liquid phase in an unsaturated granular material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an unsaturated granular material, the spatial distribution of the liquid phase results from the competition between gravity and capillary forces. We show that, in the funicular regime, it can be described by a Boltzmann law, with static disorder playing the role of thermal agitation. We propose an approach based on a Langevin equation to derive this distribution, and compare our predictions with conductivity measurements giving the local water content as a function of height in a wet granular medium. We show that experimental data obtained with samples of different polydispersities collapse on a single master curve consistent with our model.</description>
