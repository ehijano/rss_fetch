      <title>Automating physical intuition in nonlinear fiber optics with unsupervised dominant balance search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the underlying processes that locally dominate physical interactions is the key to understanding nonlinear dynamics. Machine-learning techniques have recently been shown to be highly promising in automating the search for dominant physics, adding important insights that complement analytical methods and empirical intuition. Here we apply a fully unsupervised approach to the search for dominant balance during nonlinear and dispersive propagation in optical fiber, and show that we can algorithmically identify dominant interactions in cases of optical wavebreaking, soliton fission, dispersive wave generation, and Raman soliton emergence. We discuss how dominant balance manifests both in the temporal and spectral domains as a function of propagation distance.</description>

      <title>The discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with linear gain and nonlinear loss: the infinite lattice with nonzero boundary conditions and its finite dimensional approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equations with nonzero boundary conditions define challenging problems both for the continuous (partial differential equation) or the discrete (lattice) counterparts. They are associated with fascinating dynamics emerging by the ubiquitous phenomenon of modulation instability. In this work, we consider the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with linear gain and nonlinear loss. For the infinite lattice supplemented with nonzero boundary conditions which describe solutions decaying on the top of a finite background, we give a rigorous proof that for the corresponding initial-boundary value problem, solutions exist for any initial condition, if and only if, the amplitude of the background has a precise value $A_*$ defined by the gain-loss parameters. We argue that this essential property of this infinite lattice can't be captured by finite lattice approximations of the problem. Commonly, such approximations are defined by lattices with periodic boundary conditions or as it is shown herein, by a modified problem closed with Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the finite dimensional dynamical system defined by the periodic lattice, the dynamics for all initial conditions are captured by a global attractor. Analytical arguments corroborated by numerical simulations show that the global attractor is trivial, defined by a plane wave of amplitude $A_*$. Thus, any instability effects or localized phenomena simulated by the finite system can be only transient prior the convergence to this trivial attractor. Aiming to simulate the dynamics of the infinite lattice as accurately as possible, we study the dynamics of localized initial conditions on the constant background and investigate the potential impact of the global asymptotic stability of the background with amplitude $A_*$ in the long-time evolution of the system.</description>
