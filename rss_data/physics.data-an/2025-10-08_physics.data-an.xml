      <title>Functional Connectivity Networks for Transportation Delay Analysis: from Theory to Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the endeavour of modelling and understanding the propagation of delays in transportation networks, an approach that has attracted increasing interest in the last decade is the creation of functional network representations. These graphs map elements of interest (e.g. airports or stations) as nodes, and derive pairwise propagation patterns from their dynamics through correlation and causality tests. In spite of multiple notable results, this approach still lacks a coherent framework, with decisions related to many fundamental steps being left to the judgement of the researcher. We here provide an introduction to the theory behind functional networks for transportation systems, detailing the main steps and the associated pitfalls. We further introduce a Python package, delaynet, designed to support the researcher in the reconstruction and analysis of such networks. We finally present an analysis of the propagation of delays in the Swiss train system; and discuss future research steps.</description>

      <title>Overlapping community detection in weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, community detection in overlapping un-weighted networks, where nodes can belong to multiple communities, has been one of the most popular topics in modern network science. However, community detection in overlapping weighted networks, where edge weights can be any real value, remains challenging. In this article, we propose a generative model called the weighted degree-corrected mixed membership (WDCMM) model to model such weighted networks. This model adopts the same factorization for the expectation of the adjacency matrix as the previous degree-corrected mixed membership (DCMM) model. Our WDCMM extends the DCMM from un-weighted networks to weighted networks by allowing the elements of the adjacency matrix to be generated from distributions beyond Bernoulli. We first address the community membership estimation of the model by applying a spectral algorithm and establishing a theoretical guarantee of consistency. Then, we propose overlapping weighted modularity to measure the quality of overlapping community detection for both assortative and dis-assortative weighted networks. To determine the number of communities, we incorporate the algorithm into the proposed modularity. We demonstrate the advantages of the model and the modularity through applications to simulated data and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>
