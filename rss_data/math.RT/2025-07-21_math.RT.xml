      <title>Representation theory of monoids consisting of order-preserving functions and order-reversing functions on an n-set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ be the monoid of all order-preserving functions and order-reversing functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We describe a quiver presentation for the monoid algebra $\Bbbk\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ where $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not 2. We show that the quiver consists of two straightline paths, one with $n-1$ vertices and one with $n$ vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$. As part of the proof we obtain a complete description of all homomorphisms between induced left Sch\"utzenberger modules of $\Bbbk\operatorname{OD}_{n}$. We also define $\operatorname{COD}_{n}$ to be a covering of $\operatorname{OD}_{n}$ with an artificial distinction between order-preserving and order-reversing constant functions. We show that $\operatorname{COD}_{n}\simeq\operatorname{O}_{n}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ where $\operatorname{O}_{n}$ is the monoid of all order-preserving functions on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Moreover, if $\Bbbk$ is a field whose characteristic is not $2$ we prove that $\Bbbk\operatorname{COD}_{n}\simeq\Bbbk\operatorname{O}_{n}\times\Bbbk\operatorname{O}_{n}$. As a corollary, we deduce that the quiver of $\Bbbk\operatorname{COD}_{n}$ consists of two straightline paths with n vertices, and that all compositions of consecutive arrows are equal to $0$.</description>

      <title>Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention Decomposition (PSEAD): A Group-Theoretic Framework for Equivariant Transformers in Biological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces the Theory of Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention Decomposition (PSEAD), a new and rigorous group-theoretic framework designed to seamlessly integrate local symmetry awareness into the core architecture of self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. We formalize the concept of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms, showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.</description>

      <title>Twin groups representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct two representations of the twin group $T_n, n\geq 2$, namely $\eta_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$ and $\eta_2: T_n \rightarrow \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}])$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is a free group with $n$ generators and $t$ is indeterminate. We then analyze some characteristics of these two representations, such as irreducibility and faithfulness. Moreover, we prove that both representations can be extended to the virtual twin group $VT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find their $2$-local extensions. On the other hand, we obtain a different result for the welded twin group $WT_n$. More deeply, we show that $\eta_1$ cannot be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 3$, while $\eta_2$ can be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find its $2$-local extensions.</description>

      <title>The source permutation module of a block of a finite group algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $G$ a finite group, $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$, and $S$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, the Sylow permutation module $\mathrm{Ind}^G_S(k)$ plays a role in diverse facets of representation theory and group theory, ranging from Alperin's weight conjecture to statistical considerations of $S$-$S$-double cosets in $G$. The Sylow permutation module breaks up along the block decomposition of the group algebra $kG$, but the resulting block components are not invariant under splendid Morita equivalences. We introduce a summand of the block component, which we call source permutation module, which is shown to be invariant under such equivalences. We investigate general structural properties of the source permutation module and we show that well-known results relating the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation to Alperin's weight conjecture carry over to the source permutation module. We calculate this module in various cases, such as certain blocks with cyclic defect group and blocks with a Klein four defect group, and for some blocks of symmetric groups, prompted by a question in a recent paper by Diaconis-Giannelli-Guralnick-Law-Navarro-Sambale-Spink on the self-injectivity of the endomorphism algebra of the Sylow permutation module for symmetric groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$, let $\theta(\chi)$ denote the proportion of elements $g\in G$ for which $\chi(g)$ is either zero or a root of unity. Then for any $L\in[1/2,1]$ and any $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists an irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group such that $|\theta(\chi)-L|&lt;\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric powers of $S^{(n-1,1)}$ and $D^{(n-1,1)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime and $n\geq 2$ be a positive integer. We establish new formulae for the decompositions of the first $p-1$ symmetric powers of the Specht module $S^{(n-1,1)}$ and the irreducible module $D^{(n-1,1)}$ in characteristic $p$ as direct sums of Young permutation modules. As an application of the formulae, we show that these symmetric powers have Specht filtration and find the vertices of their indecomposable summands. Our main tool, constructed in this paper, is a lift of a splitting map of a short exact sequence of certain symmetric powers to a splitting map of a short exact sequence of higher symmetric powers. This is a general construction, which can be applied to a broader family of modules.</description>

      <title>Some Lagrangian quiver Grassmannians for the equioriented cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM.</description>

      <title>Seven Sphere Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-oriented contact manifolds quite generally describe classical dynamical systems. Quantization is achieved by suitably associating a Schr\"odinger equation to every path in the contact manifold. We quantize the standard contact seven sphere by treating it as a homogeneous space of the quaternionic unitary group in order to construct a contact analog of Fedosov's formal connection on symplectic spinor bundles. We show that requiring convergence of the formal connection naturally filters the symplectic spinor bundle and yields an exact flat connection on each corresponding subbundle. A key ingredient is a generalization of the Holstein--Primakoff mechanism to the quaternionic unitary group. The passage from formal to bona fide quantization determines unitary irreducible representations of the quaternionic unitary group, whose dimensions tend to infinity as the formal deformation parameter approaches its classical limit. This appearance of finite-dimensional representations is not surprising since the contact seven sphere is closed and physically describes generalized positions, momenta and time variables.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $q=p^m$, where $p$ is an odd prime number, we study the correlation coefficient $c(\pi;H,K)$ of an irreducible (complex) representation $\pi$ of $G={\rm GL}_2(\mathbb F_q)$ with respect to a split torus $H$ and a non-split torus $K$. We consider a family of non-split tori $K_{\alpha,u}$ indexed by $u \in \mathbb F_q$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb F_q^\times \setminus \mathbb F_q^{\times 2}$. We show that under any identification of $\mathbb C$ with $\overline{\mathbb Q}_p$, and writing $\pi = \pi_r$ where $0 \leq r \leq (q-1)/2$ depending on this identification, we have \[c(\pi_r;H,K_{\alpha,u}) \equiv [P_r(u/\sqrt{\alpha})]^2 \mod p, \] where $P_r(X) \in \mathbb Z[\frac{1}{2}][X]$ is the $r$-th Legendre polynomial. As a corollary, when $m \geq 2$, we prove that there exists $u \in \mathbb F_q^\times$ such that $c(\pi;H,K_{\alpha,u}) \neq 0$ for all irreducible representations $\pi$ of $G$ admitting fixed vectors for both $H$ and $K$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a {\it triangular coefficient matrix ring} and investigate the structure of its ideals. We then characterize the radicals of the ring \( R_{h}[x]/\langle x^{n} \rangle \) for every positive integer \( n \), where \( R_{h}[x] \) denotes the Hurwitz polynomial ring and \( \langle x^{n} \rangle \) represents the ideal of this ring generated by \( x^{n} \). Furthermore, we explore several properties that are transferred between the base ring \( R \) and the matrix ring \( H_{n}(R) \) which is a proper subring of the triangular coefficient matrix ring.</description>

      <title>Any-Dimensional Polynomial Optimization via de Finetti Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial optimization problems often arise in sequences indexed by dimension, and it is of interest to produce bounds on the optimal values of all problems in the sequence. Examples include certifying inequalities between symmetric functions or graph homomorphism densities that hold over vectors and graphs of all sizes, and computing the value of mean-field games viewed as limits of games with a growing number of players. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce hierarchies of bounds for their limiting optimal values in terms of finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems. Our bounds converge at explicit rates, and they follow as a consequence of new de Finetti-type theorems pertaining to sequences of random arrays projecting onto each other in different ways. The proofs of these theorems are based on applying results from probability to representations of certain categories. We apply our framework to produce new bounds on problems arising in a number of application domains such as mean-field games, extremal graph theory, and symmetric function theory, and we illustrate our methods via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On the simplicity of the tensor product of two simple modules of quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lapid and M\'{i}nguez gave a criterion of the irreducibility of the parabolic induction $\sigma \times \pi$, where $\sigma$ is a ladder representation and $\pi$ is an arbitrary irreducible representation of the general linear group over a non-archimedean field. Through quantum affine Schur-Weyl duality, when $k$ is large enough, this gives a criterion of the irreducibility of the tensor product of a snake module $L(M)$ and any simple module $L(N)$ of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_k})$. The goal of this paper is to add conditions to their criterion such that it works for any $k \geq 1$. We prove the criterion in the case where both modules are snake modules or one of them is a fundamental module at an extremity node and the other is any simple module. We also defined a similar criterion in the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathrm{Gr}(k,n, \sim)]$, and show that for any $k \geq 1$, two ladders are compatible if and only if the corresponding tableaux satisfy the criterion. This generalizes Leclerc and Zelevinsky's result that two Pl\"{u}cker coordinates are compatible if and only if they are weakly separated.</description>

Abstract: We consider the derived category of permutation modules for a finite group, in positive characteristic. We stratify this tensor triangulated category using Brauer quotients. We describe the spectrum of its compact objects, by reducing the problem to elementary abelian groups and then by using a twisted form of cohomology to express the spectrum locally in terms of the graded endomorphism ring of the unit. Together, these results yield a classification of thick and of localizing ideals.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be the group of rational points of a split connected reductive group over a non-archimedean local field of residue characteristic $p$, and let $\mathcal{H}$ denote the pro-$p$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra of $G$ over a field of characteristic $p$. We study the parabolic induction functor for $\mathcal{H}$-modules in terms of the Gorenstein projective model structures introduced by Hovey. Let $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ denote the associated homotopy category of this model structure. We show that $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ and its thick subcategory generated by the essential images of finitely many parabolic induction functors are related via a recollement of triangulated categories. We then investigate the isomorphism classes of simple $\mathcal{H}$-modules in $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{H})$ and give a complete classification for simple supersingulars when $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$.</description>

      <title>The 2-character theory of finite 2-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the notion of character for 2-representations of finite 2-groups. The properties of 2-characters bear strong similarities to those classical characters of finite groups, including conjugation invariance, additivity, multiplicativity and orthogonality. With a careful analysis using homotopy fixed points and quotients for categories with 2-group actions, we prove that the category of class functors on a 2-group $\mathcal G$ is equivalent to the Drinfeld center of the 2-group algebra $\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G}$, which categorifies the Fourier transform on finite abelian groups. After transferring the canonical nondegenerate braided monoidal structure from $\mathfrak Z_1(\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal G})$, we discover that irreducible 2-characters of $\mathcal G$ coincide with full centers of the corresponding 2-representations, which are in a one-to-one correspondence with Lagrangian algebras in the category of class functors on $\mathcal G$. In particular, the fusion rule of $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal G)$ can be calculated from the pointwise product of Lagrangian algebras as class functors. From a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) point of view, the commutative Frobenius algebra structure on a 2-character is induced from a 2D topological sigma-model with target space $\lvert \mathrm{B} \mathcal G \rvert$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A persistence module with $m$ discrete parameters is a diagram of vector spaces indexed by the poset $\mathbb{N}^m$. If we are only interested in the large scale behavior of such a diagram, then we can consider two diagrams equivalent if they agree outside of a ``negligeable'' region. In the $2$-dimensional case, we classify the indecomposable diagrams up to finitely supported diagrams. In higher dimension, we partially classify the indecomposable diagrams up to suitably finite diagrams, and show that the full classification problem is wild.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a finite 2-group. We show that the 2-category $2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{G})$ of finite semisimple 2-representations is a symmetric fusion 2-category. We also relate the auto-equivalence 2-group of the symmetric monoidal forgetful 2-functor $\omega : 2\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{G}) \to 2\mathrm{Vec}$ to the auto-equivalence 2-group of the regular algebra and show that they are equivalent to $\mathcal{G}$. This result categorifies the usual Tannaka-Krein duality for finite groups.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Virasoro representations in Liouville conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the analytic continuation of Liouville eigenstates and shows that they assemble into irreducible highest-weight representations of the Virasoro algebra, for all values of the conformal weights. This builds on previous results from the first author and Guillarmou, Kupiainen, Rhodes &amp; Vargas, where such representations were constructed except for the conformal weight on the Kac table. In order to extend these results to the degenerate weights, we find explicit analytic expressions for the Virasoro descendants and uncover the probabilistic meaning of the Kac table.
  In the algebraic approach to conformal field theory, the irreducibility is a crucial property that must be satisfied by the representations in the spectrum, and is usually taken as an axiom. Computationally, it leads to the celebrated null-vector (or BPZ) equations for correlation functions and conformal blocks, which are the cornerstone of the integrability of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closed subgroup $G\subset_uU_N^+$ is called easy when its associated Tannakian category $C_{kl}=Hom(u^{\otimes k},u^{\otimes l})$ appears from a category of partitions, $C=span(D)$ with $D=(D_{kl})\subset P$, via the standard implementation of partitions as linear maps. The examples abound, and the main known subgroups $G\subset U_N^+$ are either easy, or not far from being easy. We discuss here the basic theory, examples and known classification results for the easy quantum groups $G\subset U_N^+$, as well as various generalizations of the formalism, known as super-easiness theories, and the unification problem for them.</description>

      <title>Arithemetic level raising theorem for some unitary Shimura varieties mod $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a real quadratic field in which a fixed prime $p$ is inert, and $E_0$ be an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ splits; put $E=E_0 F$. Let ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}$ be the special fiber over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of the Shimura variety for $G(U(1,n-1)\times U(n-1,1))$ with hyperspecial level structure at $p$ for some integer $n\geq 2$. Let ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}(K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{1})$ be the special fiber over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of a Shimura variety for $G(U(1,n-1)\times U(n-1,1))$ with parahoric level structure at $p$ for some integer $n\geq 2$. We exhibit elements in the higher Chow group of the supersingular locus of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}$ and study the stratification of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}.$ Moreover, we study the geometry of ${{\rm Sh}}_{1,n-1}(K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{1})$ and prove a form of Ihara lemma. With Ihara lemma, we prove the the arithmetic level raising map is surjective for $n=2,3.$</description>

      <title>Lie algebra homology with coefficients tensor products of the adjoint representation in relative polynomial degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles.
  There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1.
  This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</description>
