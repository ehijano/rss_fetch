      <title>CSI Compression using Channel Charting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaping the benefits of multi-antenna communication systems in frequency division duplex (FDD) requires channel state information (CSI) reporting from mobile users to the base station (BS). Over the last decades, the amount of CSI to be collected has become very challenging owing to the dramatic increase of the number of antennas at BSs. To mitigate the overhead associated with CSI reporting, compressed CSI techniques have been proposed with the idea of recovering the original CSI at the BS from its compressed version sent by the mobile users. Channel charting is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method that consists in building a radio-environment map from CSIs. Such a method can be considered in the context of the CSI compression problem, since a chart location is, by definition, a low-dimensional representation of the CSI. In this paper, the performance of channel charting for a task-based CSI compression application is studied. A comparison of the proposed method against baselines on realistic synthetic data is proposed, showing promising results.</description>

      <title>Block components of generalized quaternion group codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codes in the generalized quaternion group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[Q_{4n}]$ are considered. Restricting to char$\mathbb{F}_q \nmid 4n$ the structure of an arbitrary code $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[Q_{4n}]$ is described via the Wedderburn decomposition. Moreover it is known that in this case every code $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q[Q_{4n}]$ has a generating idempotent $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}_q[Q_{4n}]$. Given the generating idempotent of a code $C$ we determine the different components in its decomposition $C \cong \bigoplus_{j=1}^{r+s}C_j \oplus \bigoplus_{i=1}^{k+t}C'_{i}.$ Afterwards we apply this result to describe the blocks of codes induced by cyclic group codes.</description>

      <title>Extended Information Geometry: Large Deviation Theory, Statistical Thermodynamics, and Empirical Counting Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorics, probabilities, and measurements are fundamental to understanding information. This work explores how the application of large deviation theory (LDT) in counting phenomena leads to the emergence of various entropy functions, including Shannon's entropy, mutual information, and relative and conditional entropies. In terms of these functions, we reveal an inherent geometrical structure through operations, including contractions, lift, change of basis, and projections. Legendre-Fenchel (LF) transform, which is central to both LDT and Gibbs' method of thermodynamics, offers a novel energetic description of data. The manifold of empirical mean values of statistical data ad infinitum has a parametrization using LF conjugates w.r.t. an entropy function; this gives rise to the additivity known in statistical thermodynamic energetics. This work extends current information geometry to information projection as defined through conditional expectations in Kolmogorov's probability theory.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Bayesian Estimation of Fixed Channel States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies an information-theoretic performance limit of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where the goal of sensing is to estimate a random continuous state. Considering the mean-squared error (MSE) for estimation performance metric, the Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (BCRB) is widely used in literature as a proxy of the MSE; however, the BCRB is not generally tight even asymptotically except for restrictive distributions. Instead, we characterize the full tradeoff between information rate and the exact MSE using the asymptotically tight BCRB (ATBCRB) analysis, a recent variant of the BCRB. Our characterization is applicable for general channels as long as the regularity conditions are met, and the proof relies on constant composition codes and ATBCRB analysis with the codes. We also perform a numerical evaluation of the tradeoff in a variance estimation example, which commonly arises in spectrum sensing scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a recursive decoding algorithm for projective Reed-Muller codes making use of a decoder for affine Reed-Muller codes. We determine the number of errors that can be corrected in this way, which is the current highest for decoders of projective Reed-Muller codes. We show when we can decode up to the error correction capability of these codes, and we compute the order of complexity of the algorithm, which is given by that of the chosen decoder for affine Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01708v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, for a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and a natural number $l,$ let $\mathcal{R}:=\mathbb{F}_q^l.$ Firstly, for an automorphism $\Theta$ of $\mathcal{R},$ a $\Theta$-derivation $\Delta_\Theta$ of $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathbf{a}\in \mathcal{R}^\times,$ we study $(\Theta, \Delta_\Theta, \mathbf{a})$-cyclic codes over the skew polynomial ring $\mathcal{R}.$ In this direction, we give an algebraic characterization of a $(\Theta, \Delta_\Theta, \mathbf{a})$-cyclic code over $\mathcal{R},$ determine its generator polynomial, and find its decomposition over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Secondly, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a $(\Theta, 0, \mathbf{a})$-cyclic code to be Euclidean dual-containing over $\mathcal{R}.$ Thirdly, we study Gray maps and obtain several MDS and optimal linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ as Gray images of $(\Theta, \Delta_\Theta, \mathbf{a})$-cyclic codes over $\mathcal{R}.$ Moreover, we determine orthogonality preserving Gray maps and construct Euclidean dual-containing codes with good parameters. Lastly, as an application, we construct MDS and almost MDS quantum codes by employing the Euclidean dual-containing and annihilator dual-containing CSS constructions.</description>

      <title>BERT4MIMO: A Foundation Model using BERT Architecture for Massive MIMO Channel State Information Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) is an advanced wireless communication technology, using a large number of antennas to improve the overall performance of the communication system in terms of capacity, spectral, and energy efficiency. The performance of MIMO systems is highly dependent on the quality of channel state information (CSI). Predicting CSI is, therefore, essential for improving communication system performance, particularly in MIMO systems, since it represents key characteristics of a wireless channel, including propagation, fading, scattering, and path loss. This study proposes a foundation model inspired by BERT, called BERT4MIMO, which is specifically designed to process high-dimensional CSI data from massive MIMO systems. BERT4MIMO offers superior performance in reconstructing CSI under varying mobility scenarios and channel conditions through deep learning and attention mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BERT4MIMO in a variety of wireless environments.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction limits of complex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the -- hidden -- interaction structure of a system from empirical observations such as time series. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. To this end, we adopt an information-theoretical point of view and define the reconstructability -- the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. The reconstructability depends on the true data generating model which is shown to set the reconstruction limit, i.e., the performance upper bound for all algorithms. We show that the reconstructability is related to various performance measures, such as the probability of error and the Jaccard similarity. In an empirical context where the true data generating model is unknown, we introduce the reconstruction index as an approximation of the reconstructability. We find that performing model selection is crucial for the validity of the reconstruction index as a proxy of the reconstructability, and illustrate how it assesses the reconstruction limit of empirical time series and networks.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Nonconvex Low-Rank Tensor Estimation via Scaled Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensors, which give a faithful and effective representation to deliver the intrinsic structure of multi-dimensional data, play a crucial role in an increasing number of signal processing and machine learning problems. However, tensor data are often accompanied by arbitrary signal corruptions, including missing entries and sparse noise. A fundamental challenge is to reliably extract the meaningful information from corrupted tensor data in a statistically and computationally efficient manner. This paper develops a scaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly estimate the tensor factors with tailored spectral initializations under the tensor-tensor product (t-product) and tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) framework. In theory, ScaledGD achieves linear convergence at a constant rate that is independent of the condition number of the ground truth low-rank tensor for two canonical problems -- tensor robust principal component analysis and tensor completion -- as long as the level of corruptions is not too large and the sample size is sufficiently large, while maintaining the low per-iteration cost of gradient descent. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that provably has such properties for low-rank tensor estimation with the t-SVD decomposition. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of ScaledGD in accelerating the convergence rate of ill-conditioned low-rank tensor estimation in these two applications.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Iceberg in the Sea: Fundamentals of Pulse Shaping and Modulation Design for Random ISAC Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is expected to play a pivotal role in future 6G networks. To maximize time-frequency resource utilization, 6G ISAC systems must exploit data payload signals, that are inherently random, for both communication and sensing tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the sensing performance of such communication-centric ISAC signals, with a focus on modulation and pulse shaping design to reshape the statistical properties of their auto-correlation functions (ACFs), thereby improving the target ranging performance. We derive a closed-form expression for the expectation of the squared ACF of random ISAC signals, considering arbitrary modulation bases and constellation mappings within the Nyquist pulse shaping framework. The structure is metaphorically described as an ``iceberg hidden in the sea", where the ``iceberg'' represents the squared mean of the ACF of random ISAC signals, that is determined by the pulse shaping filter, and the ``sea level'' characterizes the corresponding variance, caused by the randomness of the data payload. Our analysis shows that, for QAM/PSK constellations with Nyquist pulse shaping, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe level across all lags. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Nyquist pulse shaping design to enhance the sensing performance of random ISAC signals. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings, showing that the proposed pulse shaping significantly reduces ranging sidelobes compared to conventional root-raised cosine (RRC) pulse shaping, thereby improving the ranging performance.</description>

      <title>Compressed sensing for inverse problems II: applications to deconvolution, source recovery, and MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the sample complexity theory for ill-posed inverse problems developed in a recent work by the authors [`Compressed sensing for inverse problems and the sample complexity of the sparse Radon transform', J. Eur. Math. Soc., to appear], which was originally focused on the sparse Radon transform. We demonstrate that the underlying abstract framework, based on infinite-dimensional compressed sensing and generalized sampling techniques, can effectively handle a variety of practical applications. Specifically, we analyze three case studies: (1) The reconstruction of a sparse signal from a finite number of pointwise blurred samples; (2) The recovery of the (sparse) source term of an elliptic partial differential equation from finite samples of the solution; and (3) A moderately ill-posed variation of the classical sensing problem of recovering a wavelet-sparse signal from finite Fourier samples, motivated by magnetic resonance imaging. For each application, we establish rigorous recovery guarantees by verifying the key theoretical requirements, including quasi-diagonalization and coherence bounds. Our analysis reveals that careful consideration of balancing properties and optimized sampling strategies can lead to improved reconstruction performance. The results provide a unified theoretical foundation for compressed sensing approaches to inverse problems while yielding practical insights for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Frame Codes for the Block-Erasure Channel -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog codes add redundancy by expanding the dimension using real/complex-valued operations. Frame theory provides a mathematical basis for constructing such codes, with diverse applications in non-orthogonal code-division multiple access (NOMA-CDMA), distributed computation, multiple description source coding, space-time coding (STC), and more. The channel model corresponding to these applications is a combination of noise and erasures. Recent analyses showed a useful connection between spectral random-matrix theory and large equiangular tight frames (ETFs) under random uniform erasures. In this work we generalize this model to a channel where the erasures come in blocks. This particularly fits NOMA-CDMA with multiple transmit antennas for each user and STC with known spatial grouping. We present a method to adjust ETF codes to suit block erasures, and find minimum intra-block-correlation frames which outperform ETFs in this setting.</description>

      <title>Systematic Construction of Golay Complementary Sets of Arbitrary Lengths and Alphabet Sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the important applications of Golay complementary sets (GCSs) is the reduction of peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. OFDM has played a major role in modern wireless systems such as long-term-evolution (LTE), 5th generation (5G) wireless standards, etc. This paper searches for systematic constructions of GCSs of arbitrary lengths and alphabet sizes. The proposed constructions are based on extended Boolean functions (EBFs). For the first time, we can generate codes of independent parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Optimization of STAR-RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems Relying on Imperfect Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems are investigated under spatially correlated fading channels using realistic imperfect hardware. Specifically, the transceiver distortions, \textcolor{black}{time-varying phase noise, and RIS phase shift errors} are considered. Upon considering imperfect hardware and pilot contamination, we derive a linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion-based cascaded channel estimator. Moreover, a closed-form expression of the downlink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) is derived based on maximum ratio (MR) based transmit precoding and channel statistics, where both a finite number of access points (APs) and STAR-RIS elements as well as imperfect hardware are considered. Furthermore, by exploiting the ergodic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) among user equipment (UE), a max-min fairness problem is formulated for the joint optimization of the passive transmitting and reflecting beamforming (BF) at the STAR-RIS as well as of the power control coefficients. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed for solving the resultant problems, where iterative adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and bisection methods are proposed for circumventing the non-convexity of the RIS passive BF and the quasi-concave power control sub-problems, respectively. Our simulation results illustrate that the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system attains higher SE than its RIS-aided counterpart. The performance of different hardware parameters is also evaluated. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the SE of the worst UE can be significantly improved by exploiting the proposed AO-based algorithm compared to conventional solutions associated with random passive BF and equal-power scenarios.</description>
