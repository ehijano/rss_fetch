      <title>More separations of cardinal characteristics of the strong measure zero ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{N}$ be the $\sigma$-ideal of the null sets of reals. We introduce a new property of forcing notions that enable control of the additivity of $\mathcal{N}$ after finite support iterations. This is applied to answer some open questions from the work of Brendle, the first author, and Mej\'ia~\cite{BCM2}.</description>

      <title>Solving infinitary Rubik's cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop infinitary analogues of the $N\times N\times N$ Rubik's cube. We'll be pushed to consider the possibility of transfinitely many twists and the foremost question we shall study is whether or not all infinite scrambles are solvable, in principle, and in how many twists. As is typical of infinitary generalizations of everyday games and puzzles, several alternative definitions are reasonable, including in particular the edged and edgeless cubes, which bear surprising theoretical differences, not analogous to the finite case. We show that for the edged cube of cardinality $\aleph_\alpha$, all convergent (in a suitable sense) scrambles are in fact solvable in principle in fewer than $\omega_{\alpha+1}$ many moves. For the countable edgeless variation, we prove by entirely different methods that all convergent scrambles are solvable in a mere $\omega^2$ many moves and this solution does not require knowledge of how the scrambled configuration was obtained. Finally, we explore the space of all legal configurations of the countable edgeless cube connected to the solved configuration by accessibility. We invite several open questions, including the solvability in principle of edgeless cubes of uncountable cardinality.</description>

      <title>Tree Properties at Successors of Singulars of Many Cofinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From many supercompact cardinals, we show that it is consistent for the tree property to hold at many small successors of singular cardinals, each with a different cofinality. In particular, we construct a model in which the tree property holds at $\aleph_{\omega+\omega+1}$ and at $\aleph_{\omega_n+1}$ for all $0&lt;n&lt;\omega$. We show that this can be done for the strong tree property as well, and extend the technique to large uncountable sequences of desired cofinalities.</description>

      <title>Restricted analytic valued fields with partial exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-archimedean fields with restricted analytic functions may not support a full exponential function, but they always have partial exponentials defined in convex subrings. On face of this, we study the first order theory of the class of non-archimedean ordered valued fields augmented by all restricted analytic functions and an exponential function defined in the valuation ring, which extends the restricted analytic exponential. We obtain model completeness and other desirable properties for this theory. In particular, any model embeds in a model where the partial exponential extends to a full one.</description>

      <title>Definable compactness in o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the notion of definable compactness for topological spaces definable in o-minimal structures, answering questions of Peterzil and Steinhorn (1999) and Johnson (2018). Specifically, we prove the equivalence of various definitions of definable compactness in the literature, including those in terms of definable curves, definable types, and definable downward directed families of closed sets.</description>

      <title>Forcing Axioms for Proper Posets Preserving a Topological Property: Consistency Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forcing axioms are generalizations of Baire category principles that allow one to intersect more dense open sets and to do so in a wider variety of circumstances. In this paper we introduce two new forcing axioms related to posets which preserve topological properties of various spaces, specifically the properties of Lindel{\"o}f and countably tight. The focus in this paper is on using Neeman's side conditions iteration schema to prove the consistency of these two forcing axioms. In later work, we will discuss applications of these forcing axioms.</description>
