      <title>ABIDES-MARL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Environment for Endogenous Price Formation and Execution in a Limit Order Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ABIDES-MARL, a framework that combines a new multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methodology with a new realistic limit-order-book (LOB) simulation system to study equilibrium behavior in complex financial market games. The system extends ABIDES-Gym by decoupling state collection from kernel interruption, enabling synchronized learning and decision-making for multiple adaptive agents while maintaining compatibility with standard RL libraries. It preserves key market features such as price-time priority and discrete tick sizes. Methodologically, we use MARL to approximate equilibrium-like behavior in multi-period trading games with a finite number of heterogeneous agents-an informed trader, a liquidity trader, noise traders, and competing market makers-all with individual price impacts. This setting bridges optimal execution and market microstructure by embedding the liquidity trader's optimization problem within a strategic trading environment. We validate the approach by solving an extended Kyle model within the simulation system, recovering the gradual price discovery phenomenon. We then extend the analysis to a liquidity trader's problem where market liquidity arises endogenously and show that, at equilibrium, execution strategies shape market-maker behavior and price dynamics. ABIDES-MARL provides a reproducible foundation for analyzing equilibrium and strategic adaptation in realistic markets and contributes toward building economically interpretable agentic AI systems for finance.</description>

      <title>JaxMARL-HFT: GPU-Accelerated Large-Scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based modelling (ABM) approaches for high-frequency financial markets are difficult to calibrate and validate, partly due to the large parameter space created by defining fixed agent policies. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables more realistic agent behaviour and reduces the number of free parameters, but the heavy computational cost has so far limited research efforts. To address this, we introduce JaxMARL-HFT (JAX-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading), the first GPU-accelerated open-source multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for high-frequency trading (HFT) on market-by-order (MBO) data. Extending the JaxMARL framework and building on the JAX-LOB implementation, JaxMARL-HFT is designed to handle a heterogeneous set of agents, enabling diverse observation/action spaces and reward functions. It is designed flexibly, so it can also be used for single-agent RL, or extended to act as an ABM with fixed-policy agents. Leveraging JAX enables up to a 240x reduction in end-to-end training time, compared with state-of-the-art reference implementations on the same hardware. This significant speed-up makes it feasible to exploit the large, granular datasets available in high-frequency trading, and to perform the extensive hyperparameter sweeps required for robust and efficient MARL research in trading. We demonstrate the use of JaxMARL-HFT with independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) for a two-player environment, with an order execution and a market making agent, using one year of LOB data (400 million orders), and show that these agents learn to outperform standard benchmarks. The code for the JaxMARL-HFT framework is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Option market making with hedging-induced market impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a model for option market making in which the hedging activity of the market maker generates price impact on the underlying asset. The option order flow is modeled by Cox processes, with intensities depending on the state of the underlying and on the market maker's quoted prices. The resulting dynamics combine stochastic option demand with both permanent and transient impact on the underlying, leading to a coupled evolution of inventory and price. We first study market manipulation and arbitrage phenomena that may arise from the feedback between option trading and underlying impact. We then establish the well-posedness of the mixed control problem, which involves continuous quoting decisions and impulsive hedging actions. Finally, we implement a numerical method based on policy optimization to approximate optimal strategies and illustrate the interplay between option market liquidity, inventory risk, and underlying impact.</description>
