      <title>Non-Hermitian wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15403</link>

Abstract: Wave turbulence describes the long-time statistical behavior of out-of-equilibrium systems composed of weakly interacting waves. Non-Hermitian media ranging from open quantum systems to active materials can sustain wave propagation in so-called $PT$-symmetric states where gain and loss are effectively balanced. Here, we derive the kinetic equations governing wave turbulence in a prototypical non-Hermitian medium: a three-dimensional fluid with odd viscosity. We calculate its exact anisotropic solution, the so-called Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum, and validate the existence of this regime using direct numerical simulations. This non-Hermitian wave turbulence generates a direct cascade that is sustained down to the smallest scales, suppressing the transition to strong turbulence typically observed in rotating fluids and electron magnetohydrodynamics. Beyond odd viscous fluids, this qualitative mechanism applies to any non-linear system of waves where non-Hermitian effects are enhanced at small scales through gradient terms in the dynamical equations, e.g. via odd elastic moduli or other non-reciprocal responses.</description>

      <title>Fourier analysis of the physics of transfer learning for data-driven subgrid-scale models of ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) is a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of neural networks (NNs) in applications such as weather and climate prediction and turbulence modeling. TL enables models to generalize to out-of-distribution data with minimal training data from the new system. In this study, we employ a 9-layer convolutional NN to predict the subgrid forcing in a two-layer ocean quasi-geostrophic system and examine which metrics best describe its performance and generalizability to unseen dynamical regimes. Fourier analysis of the NN kernels reveals that they learn low-pass, Gabor, and high-pass filters, regardless of whether the training data are isotropic or anisotropic. By analyzing the activation spectra, we identify why NNs fail to generalize without TL and how TL can overcome these limitations: the learned weights and biases from one dataset underestimate the out-of-distribution sample spectra as they pass through the network, leading to an underestimation of output spectra. By re-training only one layer with data from the target system, this underestimation is corrected, enabling the NN to produce predictions that match the target spectra. These findings are broadly applicable to data-driven parameterization of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent alignment in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using $10,\!080^3$ grid simulations, we analyze scale-dependent alignment in driven, compressible, no net-flux magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The plasma self-organizes into localized, strongly aligned regions. Alignment spans all primitive variables and their curls. Contrary to incompressible theory, velocity-magnetic alignment scales as $\theta(\lambda) \sim \lambda^{1/8}$, where $\lambda$ is the scale, suggesting a distinct three-dimensional eddy anisotropy and a much higher critical transition scale toward a reconnection-mediated cascade.</description>

      <title>Building symmetries into data-driven manifold dynamics models for complex flows: application to two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven reduced-order models of the dynamics of complex flows are important for tasks related to design, understanding, prediction, and control. Many flows obey symmetries, and the present work illustrates how these can be exploited to yield highly efficient low-dimensional data-driven models for chaotic flows. In particular, incorporating symmetries both guarantees that the reduced order model automatically respects them and dramatically increases the effective density of data sampling. Given data for the long-time dynamics of a system, and knowing the set of continuous and discrete symmetries it obeys, the first step in the methodology is to identify a "fundamental chart", a region in the state space of the flow to which all other regions can be mapped by a symmetry operation, and a set of criteria indicating what mapping takes each point in state space into that chart. We then find a low-dimensional coordinate representation of the data in the fundamental chart with the use of an autoencoder architecture that also provides an estimate of the dimension of the invariant manifold where data lie. Finally, we learn dynamics on this manifold with the use of neural ordinary differential equations. We apply this method, denoted "symmetry charting" to simulation data from two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow in a chaotic bursting regime. This system has a continuous translation symmetry, and discrete rotation and shift-reflect symmetries. With this framework we observe that less data is needed to learn accurate data-driven models, more robust estimates of the manifold dimension are obtained, equivariance of the NSE is satisfied, better short-time tracking with respect to the true data is observed, and long-time statistics are correctly captured.</description>
