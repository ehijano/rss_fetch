      <title>Land Bubble and Pareto Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since McCallum (1987), the presence of a productive non-reproducible asset ("land") has been thought to rule out inefficiency in overlapping generations (OLG) models, though theoretical controversies remain. This paper proves that if the natural interest rate (the counterfactual interest rate without land) is lower than the land rent growth rate and the elasticity of substitution between land and non-land factors in the production function exceeds 1, a land bubble necessarily emerges, which makes the economy efficient. We also present an example of an inefficient equilibrium when the natural interest rate is higher than the rent growth rate.</description>

      <title>Innovation ecosystems theory revisited: The case of artificial intelligence in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the mainstream discussion on the key role of China in the global AI landscape, the knowledge about the real performance and future perspectives of the AI ecosystem in China is still limited. This paper evaluates the status and prospects of China's AI innovation ecosystem by developing a Triple Helix framework particularized for this case. Based on an in-depth qualitative study and on interviews with experts, the analysis section summarizes the way in which the AI innovation ecosystem in China is being built, which are the key features of the three spheres of the Triple Helix -governments, industry and academic/research institutions-as well as the dynamic context of the ecosystem through the identification of main aspects related to the flows of skills, knowledge and funding and the interactions among them. Using this approach, the discussion section illustrates the specificities of the AI innovation ecosystem in China, its strengths and its gaps, and which are its prospects. Overall, this revisited ecosystem approach permits the authors to address the complexity of emerging environments of innovation to draw meaningful conclusions which are not possible with mere observation. The results show how a favourable context, the broad adoption rate and the competition for talent and capital among regional-specialized clusters are boosting the advance of AI in China, mainly in the business to customer arena. Finally, the paper highlights the challenges ahead in the current implementation of the ecosystem that will largely determine the potential global leadership of China in this domain.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian framework for opinion dynamics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a Bayesian framework that unifies a wide class of opinion dynamics models. In this framework, an individual's opinion on a topic is the expected value of their belief, represented as a random variable with a prior distribution. Upon receiving a signal, modeled as the prior belief plus a bias term and subject to zero-mean noise with a known distribution, the individual updates their belief distribution via Bayes' rule. By systematically varying the prior, bias, and noise distributions, this approach recovers a broad array of opinion dynamics models, including DeGroot, bounded confidence, bounded shift, and models exhibiting overreaction or backfire effects. Our analysis shows that the signal score is the key determinant of each model's mathematical structure, governing both small- and large-signal behavior. All models converge to DeGroot's linear update rule for small signals, but diverge in their tail behavior for large signals. This unification not only reveals theoretical linkages among previously disconnected models but also provides a systematic method for generating new ones, offering insights into the rational foundations of opinion formation under cognitive constraints.</description>

      <title>Proportional Representation in Rank Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In rank aggregation, the task is to aggregate multiple weighted input rankings into a single output ranking. While numerous methods, so-called social welfare functions (SWFs), have been suggested for this problem, all of the classical SWFs tend to be majoritarian and are thus not acceptable when a proportional ranking is required. Motivated by this observation, we will design SWFs that guarantee that every input ranking is proportionally represented by the output ranking. Specifically, our central fairness condition requires that the number of pairwise comparisons between candidates on which an input ranking and the output ranking agree is proportional to the weight of the input ranking. As our main contribution, we present a simple SWF called the Proportional Sequential Borda rule, which satisfies this condition. Moreover, we introduce two variants of this rule: the Ranked Method of Equal Shares, which has a more utilitarian flavor while still satisfying our fairness condition, and the Flow-adjusting Borda rule, which satisfies an even stronger fairness condition. Many of our axioms and techniques are inspired by results on approval-based committee voting and participatory budgeting, where the concept of proportional representation has been studied in depth.</description>

      <title>Strategyproof Randomized Social Choice for Restricted Sets of Utility Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social decision schemes (SDSs) map the voters' preferences over multiple alternatives to a probability distribution over these alternatives. In a seminal result, Gibbard (1977) has characterized the set of SDSs that are strategyproof with respect to all utility functions and his result implies that all such SDSs are either unfair to the voters or alternatives, or they require a significant amount of randomization. To circumvent this negative result, we propose the notion of $U$-strategyproofness which postulates that only voters with a utility function in a predefined set $U$ cannot manipulate. We then analyze the tradeoff between $U$-strategyproofness and various decisiveness notions that restrict the amount of randomization of SDSs. In particular, we show that if the utility functions in the set $U$ value the best alternative much more than other alternatives, there are $U$-strategyproof SDSs that choose an alternative with probability $1$ whenever all but $k$ voters rank it first. On the negative side, we demonstrate that $U$-strategyproofness is incompatible with Condorcet-consistency if the set $U$ satisfies minimal symmetry conditions. Finally, we show that no ex post efficient and $U$-strategyproof SDS can be significantly more decisive than the uniform random dictatorship if the voters are close to indifferent between their two favorite alternatives.</description>

      <title>Limit-Computable Grains of Truth for Arbitrary Computable Extensive-Form (Un)Known Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally, we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning. While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.</description>

      <title>All finite lattices are stable matching lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that all finite lattices, including non-distributive lattices, arise as stable matching lattices under standard assumptions on choice functions. In the process, we introduce new tools to reason on general lattices for optimization purposes: the partial representation of a lattice, which partially extends Birkhoff's representation theorem to non-distributive lattices; the distributive closure of a lattice, which gives such a partial representation; and join constraints, which can be added to the distributive closure to obtain a representation for the original lattice. Then, we use these techniques to show that the minimum cost stable matching problem under the same standard assumptions on choice functions is NP-hard, by establishing a connection with antimatroid theory.</description>
