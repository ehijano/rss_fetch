      <title>A feasible dose-volume estimation of radiotherapy treatment with optimal transport using a concept for transportation of Ricci-flat time-varying dose-volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In radiotherapy, the dose-volume histogram (DVH) curve is an important means of evaluating the clinical feasibility of tumor control and side effects in normal organs against actual treatment. Fractionation, distributing the amounts of irradiation, is used to enhance the treatment effectiveness of tumor control and mitigation of normal tissue damage. Therefore, dose and volume receive time-varying effects per fractional treatment event. However, the difficulty of DVH superimposition of different situations prevents evaluation of the total DVH despite different shapes and receiving dose distributions of organs in each fraction. However, an actual evaluation is determined traditionally by the initial treatment plan because of summation difficulty. Mathematically, this difficulty can be regarded as a kind of optimal transport of DVH. For this study, we introduced DVH transportation on the curvilinear orthogonal space with respect to arbitrary time ($T$), time-varying dose ($D$), and time-varying volume ($V$), which was designated as the TDV space embedded in the Riemannian manifold.Transportation in the TDV space should satisfy the following: (a) the metrics between dose and volume must be equivalent for any fractions and (b) the cumulative characteristic of DVH must hold irrespective of the lapse of time. With consideration of the Ricci-flat condition for the $D$-direction and $V$-direction, we obtained the probability density distribution, which is described by Poisson's equation with radial diffusion process toward $T$. This geometrical requirement and transportation equation rigorously provided the feasible total DVH.</description>

      <title>Restriction-induced time-dependent transcytolemmal water exchange: Revisiting the K\"arger exchange model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The K\"arger model and its derivatives have been widely used to incorporate transcytolemmal water exchange rate, an essential characteristic of living cells, into analyses of diffusion MRI (dMRI) signals from tissues. The K\"arger model consists of two homogeneous exchanging components coupled by an exchange rate constant and assumes measurements are made with sufficiently long diffusion time and slow water exchange. Despite successful applications, it remains unclear whether these assumptions are generally valid for practical dMRI sequences and biological tissues. In particular, barrier-induced restrictions to diffusion produce inhomogeneous magnetization distributions in relatively large-sized compartments such as cancer cells, violating the above assumptions. The effects of this inhomogeneity are usually overlooked. We performed computer simulations to quantify how restriction effects, which in images produce edge enhancements at compartment boundaries, influence different variants of the K\"arger-model. The results show that the edge enhancement effect will produce larger, time-dependent estimates of exchange rates in e.g., tumors with relatively large cell sizes (&gt;10 {\mu}m), resulting in overestimations of water exchange as previously reported. Moreover, stronger diffusion gradients, longer diffusion gradient durations, and larger cell sizes, all cause more pronounced edge enhancement effects. This helps us to better understand the feasibility of the K\"arger model in estimating water exchange in different tissue types and provides useful guidance on signal acquisition methods that may mitigate the edge enhancement effect. This work also indicates the need to correct the overestimated transcytolemmal water exchange rates obtained assuming the K\"arger-model.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Cardiac Imaging Using Deep Learning For Speckle-Tracking Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality ultrafast ultrasound imaging is based on coherent compounding from multiple transmissions of plane waves (PW) or diverging waves (DW). However, compounding results in reduced frame rate, as well as destructive interferences from high-velocity tissue motion if motion compensation (MoCo) is not considered. While many studies have recently shown the interest of deep learning for the reconstruction of high-quality static images from PW or DW, its ability to achieve such performance while maintaining the capability of tracking cardiac motion has yet to be assessed. In this paper, we addressed such issue by deploying a complex-weighted convolutional neural network (CNN) for image reconstruction and a state-of-the-art speckle tracking method. The evaluation of this approach was first performed by designing an adapted simulation framework, which provides specific reference data, i.e. high quality, motion artifact-free cardiac images. The obtained results showed that, while using only three DWs as input, the CNN-based approach yielded an image quality and a motion accuracy equivalent to those obtained by compounding 31 DWs free of motion artifacts. The performance was then further evaluated on non-simulated, experimental in vitro data, using a spinning disk phantom. This experiment demonstrated that our approach yielded high-quality image reconstruction and motion estimation, under a large range of velocities and outperforms a state-of-the-art MoCo-based approach at high velocities. Our method was finally assessed on in vivo datasets and showed consistent improvement in image quality and motion estimation compared to standard compounding. This demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of deep learning reconstruction for ultrafast speckle-tracking echocardiography.</description>
