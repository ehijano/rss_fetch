      <title>Dispersion of active particles in oscillatory Poiseuille flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particles exhibit complex transport dynamics in flows through confined geometries such as channels or pores. In this work, we employ a generalized Taylor dispersion (GTD) theory to study the long-time dispersion behavior of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in an oscillatory Poiseuille flow within a planar channel. We quantify the time-averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient as a function of the flow speed, flow oscillation frequency, and particle activity. In the weak-activity limit, asymptotic analysis shows that activity can either enhance or hinder the dispersion compared to the passive case. For arbitrary activity levels, we numerically solve the GTD equations and validate the results with Brownian dynamics simulations. We show that the dispersion coefficient could vary non-monotonically with both the flow speed and particle activity. Furthermore, the dispersion coefficient shows an oscillatory behavior as a function of the flow oscillation frequency, exhibiting distinct minima and maxima at different frequencies. The observed oscillatory dispersion results from the interplay between self-propulsion and oscillatory flow advection -- a coupling absent in passive or steady systems. Our results show that time-dependent flows can be used to tune the dispersion of active particles in confinement.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of superhydrophobic surface treatment on the dynamics of the flow in the near wake of a sphere using spatial dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscous drag results from the fluid at a surface having zero relative velocity, a phenomenon known as the no-slip condition. Superhydrophobic surfaces, when submerged in water, trap a layer of air in their surface texture, partially replacing the liquid-solid interface with a liquid-gas interface. This air layer, called the plastron, results in partial slip at the surface, thereby reducing the viscous drag. In turbulent flows, large fluctuations in pressure and velocity can deplete or completely remove the plastron from the surface. This makes evaluating the effects of superhydrophobic surface treatments on flow dynamics particularly challenging. This study examines the impact of a sustained plastron on flow dynamics in the wake of a sphere, achieved by supplying air at low pressure through pores in the sphere's surface. Instantaneous planar velocities in the wakes of spheres, both with and without superhydrophobic surface treatment, are measured within a plane passing through the sphere's centre. Dynamic mode decomposition is applied to the velocity fluctuations in the wake to evaluate how superhydrophobic surface treatments affect flow dynamics in the near wake. It is shown that the addition of the pores has a relatively small effect on the dynamics in the wake of the sphere, while the dynamics in the wake are radically changed by the addition of superhydrophobic surface treatment when the plastron is sustained.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of a deformable droplet under convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation of a deformable droplet under convection is investigated and the performance of the classical and Abramzon-Sirignano (A-S) models is evaluated. Using the Immersed Boundary/Front-Tracking (IB/FT) method, interface-resolved simulations are performed to examine droplet evaporation dynamics over a wide range of Reynolds ($20 \leq Re \leq 200$), Weber ($0.65 \leq We \leq 9$), and mass transfer ($1 \leq B_M \leq 15$) numbers. It is shown that flow in the wake region is greatly influenced by the Stefan flow, as higher evaporation rates lead to earlier flow separation and a larger recirculation zone behind the droplet. Under strong convection, the models fail to capture the evaporation rate, especially in the wake region, which leads to significant discrepancies compared to interface-resolved simulations. Droplet deformation greatly influences the flow field around the droplet and generally enhances evaporation, but the evaporation rate remains well correlated with the surface area. The A-S model exhibits reasonably good performance for a nearly spherical droplet but its performance deteriorates significantly and generally underpredicts the evaporation rate as droplet deformation increases. The A-S model is overall found to outperform the classical model in the presence of significant convection.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations around Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows at realistic Reynolds numbers generally rely on filtering out small scales from the Navier Stokes equations and modeling their impact through the Reynolds stress tensor ${\tau}_{ij}$. Traditional models approximate ${\tau}_{ij}$ solely as a function of the filtered velocity gradient, leading to deterministic subgrid scale closures. However, small scale fluctuations can locally exhibit instantaneous values whose deviation from the mean can have a significant influence on flow dynamics. In this work, we investigate these effects by employing direct numerical simulations combined with Gaussian filtering to quantify subgrid scale effects and evaluating the local energy flux in both space and time. The mean performance of the canonical Clark model is assessed by conditioning the energy flux distributions on the invariants of the filtered velocity gradient tensor, $Q$ and $R$. The Clark model captures to a good degree the mean energy flux. However, the fluctuations around these mean values for given ($Q,R$) are of the order of the mean displaying fat tailed distributions. To become more precise, we examine the joint distributions of true energy flux and the predictions from both the Clark and the Smagorinsky models. This approach mirrors the strategy adopted in early stochastic subgrid scale models. Clear non Gaussian characteristics emerge from the obtained distributions, particularly through the appearance of heavy tails. The mean, the variance, the skewness and flatness of these distributions are quantified. Our results emphasize that fluctuations are an integral component of the small scale feedback onto large scale dynamics and should be incorporated into subgrid scale modeling through an appropriate stochastic framework.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed, boundary-constrained Gaussian process regression for the reconstruction of fluid flow fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression techniques have been used in fluid mechanics for the reconstruction of flow fields from a reduction-of-dimension perspective. A main ingredient in this setting is the construction of adapted covariance functions, or kernels, to obtain such estimates. In this paper, we derive physics-informed kernels for simulating two-dimensional velocity fields of an incompressible (divergence-free) flow around aerodynamic profiles. These kernels allow to define Gaussian process priors satisfying the incompressibility condition and the prescribed boundary conditions along the profile in a continuous manner. Such physical and boundary constraints can be applied to any pre-defined scalar kernel in the proposed methodology, which is very general and can be implemented with high flexibility for a broad range of engineering applications. Its relevance and performances are illustrated by numerical simulations of flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil profile, for which no observation at the boundary is needed at all.</description>

      <title>Chaotic/turbulent cross-helical MHD dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using results of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations, it is shown that cross-helicity can dominate power spectra of the magnetic field generated by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo in a chaotic/turbulent von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n flow and its numerical analogue (simulation). The theoretical consideration is based on a Kolmogorov-like phenomenology within the framework of the distributed chaos concept. The observations of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field (solar activity) have been briefly discussed in this context.</description>

      <title>Critical bubble bursting in real water. Effect of surface-active contaminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bubble bursting under critical conditions, i.e., those leading to the minimum (maximum) size (velocity) of the first-emitted jet droplet. Our experiments show that a tiny amount of surfactant considerably increases (decreases) the droplet radius (velocity). The volume of the first-emitted droplet increases by a factor of 20 in the presence of surfactant, even for concentrations that produce an insignificant reduction in the bubble surface tension. Surfactant accumulates at the bubble base due to cavity bottom shrinkage and surfactant convection. The resulting Marangoni stress reduces the magnitude of the curvature along one of the principal radii of curvature on the bubble lateral surface. It widens the region of free surface reversal, which increases the emitted jet (droplet) size. A significant increase in the droplet size is also observed even with a weak surfactant. This indicates that natural water contamination can substantially alter the bubble bursting at the critical conditions.</description>

      <title>A new data-driven energy-stable Evolve-Filter-Relax model for turbulent flow simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to define the filter and relax steps in the evolve-filter-relax (EFR) framework for simulating turbulent flows. The EFR main advantages are its ease of implementation and computational efficiency. However, as it only contains two parameters (one for the filter step and one for the relax step) its flexibility is rather limited. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach in which the optimal filter is found based on DNS data in the frequency domain. The optimization step is computationally efficient and only involves one-dimensional least-squares problems for each wavenumber. Across both decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow, our learned filter decisively outperforms the standard differential filter and the Smagorinsky model, yielding significantly improved accuracy in energy spectra and in the temporal evolution of both energy and enstrophy. In addition, the relax parameter is determined by requiring energy and/or enstrophy conservation, which enforces stability of the method and reduces the appearance of numerical wiggles, especially when the filter is built in scarce data regimes. Applying the learned filter is also more computationally efficient compared to traditional differential filters, as it circumvents solving a linear system.</description>

      <title>Low-order reaction-diffusion system approximates heat transfer and flow structure in annular convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer in a fluid can be greatly enhanced by natural convection, giving rise to the nuanced relationship between the Nusselt number and Rayleigh number that has been a focus of modern fluid dynamics. Our work explores convection in an annular domain, where the geometry reinforces the large-scale circulatory flow pattern that is characteristic of natural convection. The flow must match the no-slip condition at the boundary, leading to a thin boundary layer where both the flow velocity and the temperature vary rapidly. To understand the system's heat transfer characteristics, we derive a reduced model from the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations, whereby the equations of flow and heat are transformed to a system of low-order partial differential equations (PDEs) that take the form of a reaction-diffusion system. Solutions to the reaction-diffusion system, though they fail to predict dynamic events, preserve the same boundary-layer structure seen in the direct numerical simulation (DNS). By matching the solutions inside and outside the boundary layer, asymptotic analysis predicts a power-law relationship Nu $\propto$ Ra$^{1/4}$. Though difficult to distinguish from an exponent of 2/7, the predicted power law agrees well with measurements from DNS over several decades of the Rayleigh number. Considering the model's deficiencies in describing turbulent fluctuations and reversal events, the agreement regarding heat transfer characteristics is encouraging and suggests that the methodology of systematically deriving low-order PDEs from the governing equations may provide a useful complement to existing theories.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Lagrangian Particles in Shell Models of Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lagrangian acceleration has been investigated both experimentally and numerically in the past, and it has been shown to exhibit extreme fluctuations, which have been rationalized as events in which tracer particles get trapped into vortical structures such as vortex tubes or filaments. Here, we consider the statistics of acceleration within the multifractal framework, as in Biferale et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 064502 (2004), and investigate the statistics of Lagrangian acceleration using shell models of turbulence, as in G. Boffetta et al. Phys. Rev. E 66, 066307 (2002), that -- by construction -- do not contain vortical structures. Our analysis shows that, even in the absence of coherent vortex structures, the multifractal model accurately captures the extreme intermittent fluctuations observed in the acceleration, with predictions that remain robust across a wide range of Reynolds numbers.</description>

Abstract: We present an objective measure for the unsteady component of a time-dependent velocity field derived from a spatio-temporal variational principle. As an application, we define an objective analogue of the classical $Q$-criterion based on extremizers of unsteadiness minimization. We apply this new criterion to several explicit solutions of the Navier--Stokes equation and compare the results to existing vortex criteria.</description>

      <title>Mutual friction and vortex Hall angle in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of a quantized vortex is intimately connected with its microscopic structure and the elementary excitations of the surrounding fluid. In this work, we investigate the two-dimensional motion of a single vortex orbiting a pinned anti-vortex in a unitary Fermi superfluid at varying temperature. By analyzing its trajectory, we measure the yet-unknown longitudinal and transverse mutual friction coefficients, which quantify the vortex-mediated coupling between the normal and superfluid components. Both coefficients increase while approaching the superfluid transition. They provide access to the vortex Hall angle, which is linked to the relaxation time of the localized quasiparticles occupying Andreev bound states within the vortex core, as well as the intrinsic superfluid parameter associated with the transition from laminar to quantum turbulent flows. We compare our results with numerical simulations and an analytic model originally formulated for superfluid $^3$He in the low-temperature limit, finding good agreement. Our work highlights the interplay between vortex-bound quasiparticles and delocalized thermal excitations in shaping vortex dynamics in unitary Fermi superfluids. Further, it provides a novel testbed for studying out-of-equilibrium vortex matter at finite temperatures.</description>
