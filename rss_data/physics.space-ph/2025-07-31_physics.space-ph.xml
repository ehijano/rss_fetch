      <title>Physics-Informed EvolveGCN: Satellite Prediction for Multi Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of autonomous systems, interaction among agents within a shared environment is both inevitable and essential for enhancing overall system capabilities. A key requirement in such multi-agent systems is the ability of each agent to reliably predict the future positions of its nearest neighbors. Traditionally, graphs and graph theory have served as effective tools for modeling inter agent communication and relationships. While this approach is widely used, the present work proposes a novel method that leverages dynamic graphs in a forward looking manner. Specifically, the employment of EvolveGCN, a dynamic graph convolutional network, to forecast the evolution of inter-agent relationships over time. To improve prediction accuracy and ensure physical plausibility, this research incorporates physics constrained loss functions based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of motion. This integrated approach enhances the reliability of future state estimations in multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Structure in the Auroral Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The auroral ionosphere presents a paradox: turbulence often thrives in a conductive layer that should suppress the growth rates of plasma instabilities. Using a novel composite power spectrum from coherent radar and GPS data, we show that turbulence on a wide range of scales stem not from local instabilities. Instead, its spectrum is a structural imprint of field-aligned electrical currents, and its dissipative character is governed by the flux of precipitating particles. Our measurements provide a clear geophysical example of a driven, emergent system of self-organized dissipative structures.</description>

      <title>A Flare-related Decimetric Type-IV Radio Burst Induced by the X2 Radiation of Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation mechanism of decimetric wideband and pulsating radio bursts from the Sun (in terms of decimetric type-IV (t-IVdm) burst) and other flaring stars is a long-standing problem. Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here, we analyzed the flare-associated t-IVdm burst on 20110924 with medium-strong levels of polarization and from sources near a sunspot. We found that the emission is intermittent and the maximum $T_B$ exceeds 10$^{11}$ K, with well-defined upper and lower frequency cutoffs. The radio sources are left-handed polarized, located above the sunspot with a negative polarity. The sources align well with the sites of the second harmonic of the local electron gyrofrequency. These findings provide essential evidence that the burst is induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) in the harmonic X mode. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. We also found the ECME-radiating energetic electrons exhibit a shell-like VDF instead of the generally-presumed loss-cone distribution. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.</description>
