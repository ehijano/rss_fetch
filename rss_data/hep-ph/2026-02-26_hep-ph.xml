      <title>Lepton asymmetry leading to baryogenesis by primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryogenesis remains an unresolved problem in cosmology, with existing mechanisms facing significant caveats. We show that the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on neutrinos produce the lepton asymmetry $\sim 10^{-10}$ which subsequently produces the baryon asymmetry. We consider the Dirac Lagrangian in curved spacetime in local coordinates exhibiting Hermitian pseudo-vector and non-Hermitian vector terms. These terms lead to energy splitting between weakly interacting neutrinos and antineutrinos, resulting in their unequal number densities and hence a lepton asymmetry. While the non-Hermitian effect leads to a non-conserved total probability of neutrinos, the leptogenesis due to gravitational effects of a PBH could be significant until the nucleosynthesis era. This in turn produces baryon asymmetry from the symmetry of lepton and baryon numbers via the sphaleron process in the electro-weak era. We show that in the most conservative scenario, the PBHs of mass $\sim 10^{12}$ g and spin $\sim 0.01$ produce the observed baryogenesis at temperature 130 GeV, when such PBHs are available abundantly. However, massive PBHs also could produce the observed asymmetry, assuming the non/anti-Hermitian vector couplings for neutrino and anti-neutrino get canceled from the Lagrangian, leading the system to be Hermitian.</description>

      <title>Coherent Quantum Evaluation of Collider Amplitudes for Effective Field Theory Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements at electron-positron colliders provide stringent tests of the Standard Model and powerful probes of possible higher-dimensional interactions. We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework for computing leading-order helicity amplitudes for $e^+e^-\to \ell^+\ell^-$ scattering on gate-based quantum hardware and using the resulting cross sections to constrain both Standard Model couplings and effective field theory operators. In our approach, external kinematics are encoded into single-qubit Weyl spinors, and full helicity amplitudes are reconstructed by coherently combining diagrammatic contributions within a single quantum circuit. Classical post-processing yields physical amplitudes and differential cross sections that can be directly compared with collider data. As a proof of concept, we compute unpolarised angular distributions and perform binned likelihood fits to precision electron-positron measurements. The extracted bounds are statistically consistent with Standard Model expectations, demonstrating that quantum-assisted amplitude evaluation can interface directly with phenomenological analyses and experimental data. This work establishes a concrete pathway toward applying quantum computing to precision collider physics and effective field theory studies.</description>

      <title>Precision measurements of 2-3 oscillation parameters in the next-generation long-baseline experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, data from leading neutrino experiments have firmly established neutrino oscillation, implying non-zero neutrino masses and leptonic mixing and thereby providing confirmed evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. On the backdrop of the precision era of neutrino oscillation, this thesis underscores its relevance by demonstrating the physics reach of the forthcoming long-baseline experiments -- Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) -- to establish non-maximal $\theta_{23}$, resolve the correct $\theta_{23}$ octant, and improve the precision on $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$ by efficiently breaking parameter degeneracies. This is enabled by DUNE's high-resolution LArTPC detector and its wide-band beam, achieving sensitivity at a high confidence level compared to the global fits of world neutrino data. The combined analysis of DUNE and Hyper-K not only significantly enhances sensitivity to these phenomenological studies but also demonstrates their capabilities at lower exposures when operated together, relative to their nominal individual exposures. In addition, we investigate the impact of flavor-dependent long-range interactions arising from anomaly-free U(1)' extensions of the Standard Model, showing that although subdominant long-range interactions can substantially influence the sensitivity and precision of oscillation parameter measurements, the complementary strengths of DUNE and Hyper-K mitigate these challenges to a large extent.</description>

      <title>Elastic neutrino-electron scattering perspectives at nuclear reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the weak mixing angle, $\sin^2\theta_W$, at low momentum transfers remains a powerful test of the Standard Model and its potential new physics extensions. In this paper, we explore some physics opportunities at present and future reactor neutrino experiments through elastic neutrino-electron scattering (E$\nu$ES). We assess the expected sensitivity to the weak mixing angle considering the CLOUD, TAO, and DANSS experimental configurations. We find that both CLOUD and TAO may achieve a precision that surpasses the current global fit from reactor experiments, while DANSS alone is expected to surpass the benchmark precision set by TEXONO measurement of the weak mixing angle. Additionally, we derive projected upper limits for the non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI), effective neutrino magnetic moment ($\mu_\nu$) and translate these into constraints on the neutrino transition magnetic moments ($\Lambda_i$). Our results demonstrate the physics potential of the E$\nu$ES channel at current and upcoming reactor-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD equation of state constrained by lattice QCD: neural-ODE for probe-limit and a back-reaction test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equation of state (EoS) of QCD matter in a bottom-up holographic setup that combines an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) sector with an improved Karch-Katz-Son-Stephanov (KKSS) flavor action. In the probe approximation, we perform an inverse reconstruction of the model functions by parameterizing them with neural networks and solving the EMD equations via a differentiable ODE solver (a neural ODE framework), calibrating the model to a $(2+1)$-flavor lattice-QCD EoS at finite temperature and finite baryon chemical potential. The reconstructed model functions are then parametrized and kept fixed across thermodynamic states. Next, viewing the EMD sector as an effective description of pure Yang--Mills theory, we fix its parameters by fitting the $\mu_B=0$ lattice pure-glue EoS using a hybrid optimization strategy. Finally, we go beyond the probe limit and solve the coupled EMD$+$KKSS equations with back-reaction, using the pure-glue-calibrated EMD sector as a fixed input and varying the KKSS couplings to compare with the $\mu_B=0$ two-flavor lattice EoS. We find a visible mismatch and a high-temperature behavior in which the back-reacted dimensionless ratios approach a nearly $\beta_1$-insensitive plateau close to the pure-glue baseline, providing a simple structural diagnostic for the present flavor-sector truncation.</description>

      <title>Study of the decay pattern of $f_0 (1370)$ as a $\kappa \bar{\kappa }$ molecular state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that the $f_0(1370)$ is a $\kappa \bar{\kappa}$ molecular state, the partial widths of its various decay channels are calculated, including the two-body decay $K \bar{K}$, $\pi \pi$, $\eta \eta$ and the four-body decay $\rho \rho / \sigma \sigma \to 4 \pi$ and $K \bar{K} \pi \pi$. The coupling of $g_{f_0(1370) \kappa \bar{\kappa}}\approx 13$ GeV estimated from the Weinberg criterion appears to be significantly underestimated. If this coupling is adjusted to $25 \sim 40$ GeV, the total width of $f_0(1370)$ can be fitted to the measured value $200\sim 500$ MeV. At the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1.37$ GeV, the channels that mainly contribute to the total width are $K \bar{K}$, $\pi \pi$ and $4 \pi$ ranked as $\Gamma(K \bar{K }) &gt; \Gamma(4 \pi) \approx \Gamma (\pi \pi) $ with $g_{f_0(1370) \kappa \bar{\kappa}}= 35$ GeV. Around $1.37$ GeV, the decay widths of the two-body channels $K \bar{K}$, $\pi \pi$ and $\eta \eta$ remain stable with variation in $\sqrt{s}$, whereas the decay widths of the four-body channels $4 \pi$ and $K \bar{K }\pi \pi$ increase continuously with $\sqrt{s}$. Most current data are model-dependent and conflicting, such as the $4 \pi$ dominant conclusion and the $K \bar{K}$ to $\pi \pi$ ratios. The current data can not rule out the $\kappa \bar{\kappa}$ assignment for $f_0(1370)$. Further reliable theoretical and experimental analyses of $f_0(1370)$ are required to reveal its nature.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ dibaryons in QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of a family of fully-charm tetraquark states by the LHCb, ATLAS and CMS Collaborations suggests the possible existence of fully-heavy dibaryons. In this work, we investigate the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ dibaryons in both the $^1S_0$ and $^5S_2$ channels using the method of QCD sum rules. We employ the iterative dispersion relation (IDR) method to efficiently compute the massive five-loop banana diagrams that appear in these systems, and properly address the tricky small-circle divergence problem in the nonperturbative terms. Our analyses reveal that for both charm and bottom systems, the scalar dibaryon lies lower than its tensor counterpart. The mass of the scalar $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ dibaryon is found to be slightly above the $2\Omega_{ccc}$ mass threshold, while the $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ systems may form bound states.</description>

      <title>Solving stiff dark matter equations via Jacobian Normalization with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stiff differential equations pose a major challenge for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), often causing poor convergence. We propose a simple, hyperparameter-free method to address stiffness by normalizing loss residuals with the Jacobian. We provide theoretical indications that Jacobian-based normalization can improve gradient descent and validate it on benchmark stiff ordinary differential equations. We then apply it to a realistic system: the stiff Boltzmann equations (BEs) governing weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM). Our approach achieves higher accuracy than attention mechanisms previously proposed for handling stiffness, recovering the full solution where prior methods fail. This is further demonstrated in an inverse problem with a single experimental data point - the observed DM relic density - where our inverse PINNs correctly infer the cross section that solves the BEs in both Standard and alternative cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Resonance-aware parton-shower matching for off-shell top-antitop production with semi-leptonic decays at electron-positron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present full off-shell NLO corrections in QCD obtained with the MoCaNLO code matched to parton shower. A resonance-aware matching procedure has been devised for the MC@NLO method tuned to the Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction. Specifically, we consider the off-shell production of a top-antitop pair in the semi-leptonic decay channel in electron-positron collisions and match it to the final-state QCD parton shower of PYTHIA8. Distortions of resonances' line shapes are avoided by providing the details of the resonance-cascade chain on an event-by-event basis to the parton shower and by adapting the matching accordingly through the introduction of dedicated counterterms.</description>

      <title>ALP Dark Matter, Cosmological Magnetic Fields and the Direct Collapse Black Hole Formation Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that dark matter is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle which couples to electromagnetism like an axion (an ALP), we demonstrate that the coupling of the cosmological magnetic field produced by the ALP field oscillations to the primordial dark matter fluctuations yields a spectrum of gauge field fluctuations which can produce a sufficient flux of Lyman-Werner photons to enable the Direct Collapse Black Hole formation scenario. The induced flux is consistent with the bounds on the excess flux of radio photons from ARCADE2 and EDGES measurements.</description>

      <title>Shock-induced chiral magnetic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak-interaction-mediated chiral imbalance generation in idealized massless electrons during core-collapse supernovae was once proposed to be the source of strong magnetic fields found in neutron stars. The effect goes by the name of chiral plasma instability (CPI). However, it was found that a finite electron mass damps out this process, inactivating the instability and preventing magnetic field growth. In this work we show that the instability can survive in the presence of abrupt density and temperature perturbation that drives the system sufficiently far out of weak equilibrium. As an example, we work with such perturbations generated by shockwaves which are common during both core collapse as well as neutron star mergers. We find that the chiral imbalance resulting from shock waves, under the right conditions of density and temperature, can sustain the chiral plasma instability despite the damping from the electron mass. Additionally, in an already magnetized medium, the chiral magnetic effect resulting from shock wave density and temperature perturbation can generate substantial ohmic heating. Our results imply that shockwaves during core-collapse supernovae and merging neutron stars can act as a source of strong heating in a magnetized medium as well as CPI.</description>

      <title>Bjorken Flow of Holographic R-Charged Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the time evolution of several physical observables for the so-called 2 R-Charge Black Hole (2RCBH) model undergoing Bjorken flow. The 2RCBH model corresponds to a top-down holographic construction describing a strongly interacting conformal fluid defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. Taken together with previous findings for the purely thermal $\mathcal{N}=4$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma, and the 1 R-Charge Black Hole (1RCBH) model, our results for the 2RCBH model provide strong numerical evidence for the existence of far-from-equilibrium correlations between the non-equilibrium holographic entropy defined through the area of the apparent horizon of dynamical bulk black holes, and the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of the dual boundary quantum field theory. Such correlations are relevant in the pre-hydrodynamic stages of some initial data evolved in time, and seem to hold at least for strongly interacting conformal fluids, be they charged or neutral.</description>

      <title>Forward hadron production in proton-air collisions above LHC energies through the fluctuations of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primary proton-air interactions at ultra-high energies leave a physically interpretable imprint on the correlated fluctuations of the depth of shower maximum and the muon content in extensive air showers. This imprint reflects the stochasticity in the partition of the primary energy among secondary particles in the first interaction. We show that these fluctuations can be accessed through a probabilistic description that isolates sensitivity to hadronic physics in the initial collision, while treating the subsequent shower development as effectively universal. The uncertainties resulting from this universality are smaller than the spread among current hadronic interaction models and comparable to current experimental uncertainties. Consequently, the joint observable space defined by these two quantities provides a new probe of hadron production in kinematic regimes far beyond the reach of human-made accelerators.</description>

      <title>Choice of Quantum Vacuum for Inflation Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the modifications to inflationary observables that arise when adopting an $\alpha$-vacuum instead of the standard Bunch--Davies vacuum for quantum fluctuations during inflation. Within the Starobinsky inflationary model, we compute and compare the scalar spectral index, its running, and the running of the running arising from different choices of the initial vacuum state. We further examine the energy scales associated with $\alpha$-vacua and argue that, for any number of extra spatial dimensions, the relevant scale can be truncated at the Hubble scale, $\sim$$\mathcal{O}(10^{13})\,\mathrm{GeV}$, without conflict with current Cavendish-type experimental bounds on sub-millimeter gravity ($\sim$$250\,\mu\mathrm{m}$). Our analysis demonstrates that the $\alpha$-vacuum is subject to stringent constraints as a viable de~Sitter-invariant alternative to the Euclidean (Bunch--Davies) vacuum, with the corrections that it induces in the inflationary observables being strongly limited by the latest Planck data.</description>

      <title>Searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model in hyperon sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperon physics offers a distinctive laboratory for probing the intensity frontier and searching for physics beyond the Standard Model. This review summarizes recent results from the BESIII experiment, including pioneering studies of dark baryons, massless BSM particles, and invisible decay modes, together with investigations of baryon- and lepton-number violation. A central highlight is the determination of the $\Lambda$ electric dipole moment using quantum-entangled hyperon-antihyperon pairs, achieving a sensitivity three orders of magnitude beyond previous limits. These measurements provide world-leading constraints on new physics scenarios and establish a robust foundation for next-generation precision studies. By integrating experimental progress with theoretical developments and future facility prospects, this review emphasizes the critical role of hyperon probes in testing the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <title>Supercool subtleties of cosmological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate rarely explored details of supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions at the electroweak scale, which may lead to strong gravitational wave signals or explain the cosmic baryon asymmetry. The nucleation temperature is often used in phase transition analyses, and is defined through the nucleation condition: on average one bubble has nucleated per Hubble volume. We argue that the nucleation temperature is neither a fundamental nor essential quantity in phase transition analysis. We illustrate scenarios where a transition can complete without satisfying the nucleation condition, and conversely where the nucleation condition is satisfied but the transition does not complete. We also find that simple nucleation heuristics, which are defined to approximate the nucleation temperature, break down for strong supercooling. Thus, studies that rely on the nucleation temperature $\unicode{x2014}$ approximated or otherwise $\unicode{x2014}$ may misclassify the completion of a transition. Further, we find that the nucleation temperature decouples from the progress of the transition for strong supercooling. We advocate use of the percolation temperature as a reference temperature for gravitational wave production, because the percolation temperature is directly connected to transition progress and the collision of bubbles. Finally, we provide model-independent bounds on the bubble wall velocity that allow one to predict whether a transition completes based only on knowledge of the bounce action curve. We apply our methods to find empirical bounds on the bubble wall velocity for which the physical volume of the false vacuum decreases during the transition. We verify the accuracy of our predictions using benchmarks from a high temperature expansion of the Standard Model and from the real scalar singlet model.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor of four-fermion operator and fermion portal dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ultraviolet realization of semileptonic four-fermion operator $O_{ledq}^{\alpha \beta 11}$ that incorporates Majorana dark matter (DM) in both lepton-flavor-conserving (LFC) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) scenarios at the one-loop level via box diagram, which effectively alleviates the lower bounds on the new physics scale. The interplay between the model-independent constraints on the Wilson coefficients and DM direct detection, relic density, and collider searches in the context of fermion portal DM model with two mediators is investigated. We find that both the projected future constraint on the LFC Wilson coefficient $C_{ledq}^{2211}/\Lambda^2&lt; (12.3~\text{TeV})^{-2}$ from the measurements of neutrino non-standard interaction in the next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments, and LFV constraint $C_{ledq}^{1211}/\Lambda^2&lt; \left(2.2\times 10^3~\text{TeV} \right)^{-2}$ from ongoing charged-lepton-flavor-violation searches, provide a complementary exploration of the parameter space encompassing the DM mass and scalar mass. With the colored mediator mass typically around $2~\text{TeV}$, the sensitivity of the indirect constraints on the four-fermion operator could surpass those of collider searches and DM direct detection, in scenarios where the masses of the DM and scalar are close. By ensuring the correct DM relic density, however, we obtain that the collider searches and DM direct detection are more sensitive to the electroweak scale DM and scalar compared to the indirect constraints.</description>

Abstract: We present predictions for the production and decay of a top--antitop pair in association with a Z boson in the multi-lepton decay channel at the LHC. Our results include the complete set of LO and NLO contributions. Since our calculation is based on full matrix elements, off-shell effects are entirely taken into account.

      <title>Axion-like particle production from lepton-nucleon scattering in chiral effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the axion/axion-like particle production from the lepton-nucleon scattering in the low-energy region, i.e., the $\ell N\to \ell N a$ processes, $\ell$ being the electron or muon and $N$ the proton or neutron. We simultaneously include three different types of axion interaction couplings within the chiral effective field theory, namely the axion-nucleon-nucleon couplings $g_{aNN}$, axion-photon-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ and axion-photon-vector meson resonances couplings $g_{\rho a\gamma}$ and $g_{\omega a\gamma}$. Vast inputs from the lattice QCD and hadron phenomenological studies are used to fix the unknown couplings. The relative strengths of different axion interactions in the $\ell N\to \ell N a$ processes are then revealed. We provide detailed predictions for the differential cross sections with respect to various angles and axion energy, as well as the total cross sections in the low-energy region around production thresholds, both for the Kim-Shifman-Vainstein-Zakharov (KSVZ) and Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axion models.</description>

      <title>Asteroid-mass soliton as the dark matter-baryon coincidence solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nontopological solitons formed during first-order phase transitions can serve as macroscopic dark matter candidates, with their stability ensured by a charge asymmetry traditionally assumed to originate from baryogenesis. Following this generic pattern, we demonstrate that solitogenesis after baryogenesis makes the solitons a coincident dark matter candidate, providing new explanations for the coincidence problem between baryon and dark matter energy densities. We derive a novel and robust conclusion: asteroid-mass coincident soliton dark matter is always accompanied by detectable gravitational waves observable by LISA, $\mu$Ares, and Theia, providing a new candidate beyond primordial black holes in this mass window. Additionally, we propose a simple neutrino-ball scenario that addresses baryon asymmetry, dark matter, and neutrino masses, featuring new particles below the electroweak scale and correlated observable signals, including lensing, gravitational waves, and soliton evaporation or collisions.</description>

      <title>Calculations of Di-Hadron Production via Two-Photon Processes in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00996v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon processes in relativistic heavy-ion collisions have emerged as a critical probe of quantum electrodynamics in ultra-intense electromagnetic fields, with recent focus extending beyond dileptons to hadronic final states. At present, quantitative studies of di-hadron production via two-photon interactions remain scarce. In this work, we employ the Equivalent Photon Approximation and the two-photon fusion measurements from \(e^{+}e^{-}\) collisions to obtain differential cross-section predictions for \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(K^{+}K^{-}\), and \(p\bar{p}\) pairs produced in ultra-peripheral \(\mathrm{Au{+}Au}\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\,\text{GeV}\) within the STAR acceptance, as well as in \(\mathrm{Pb{+}Pb}\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.36\,\text{TeV}\) within typical LHC acceptance. The calculations deliver the unified baseline for light-meson and baryon pairs in this environment, supplying benchmarks for upcoming STAR and LHC measurements and guiding future systematic investigations of hadronic two-photon processes at RHIC and LHC facilities.</description>

Abstract: Using a variety of experimental results and lattice QCD calculations of $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths, while employing dispersive representations of the amplitude based on Roy equations, we compute the subthreshold parameters of this process. We use Monte Carlo sampling to numerically model the probability distribution of the results based on all uncertainties in the inputs. We also investigate the dependence of the results on a theoretical correlation between the $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths $a^0_0$ and $a^2_0$, which was previously established in the framework of two-flavor chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>When inverse seesaw meets inverse electroweak phase transition: a novel path to leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new nonthermal leptogenesis mechanism triggered by the cosmic first-order phase transition. The Standard Model is extended with two generations of TeV-scale vectorlike leptons. The lighter generation gives rise to an inverse electroweak phase transition of the Higgs field at $T\sim200~{\rm GeV}$, restoring the symmetry, and resulting in relativistic bubble expansion in the space. The heavier generation is responsible for neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism. The interaction between bubble walls and particles in the plasma abundantly produces the vectorlike leptons, and they subsequently undergo CP-violating decay to generate the baryon asymmetry. This mechanism is testable at current and future particle experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale offers several theoretical and phenomenological advantages, such as accommodating the observed Higgs mass and alleviating the flavor and CP problems. However, flavor and CP observables still impose stringent constraints even at the PeV scale, motivating a systematic study of flavor symmetries in this regime. In this work, we investigate nucleon decay induced by dimension-five operators in supersymmetric standard models and examine how flavor symmetries, particularly of the Froggatt-Nielsen type, can suppress these operators. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining flavor, CP, and proton-decay observables to quantify the allowed parameter space and identify characteristic predictions. Our results demonstrate that a multi-messenger approach, integrating flavor, CP, and baryon-number-violating observables, is essential for probing the underlying structure of supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale.</description>

      <title>Emergence of kaonium as a sharp resonance in photon-photon to meson-meson cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the binding energies of the hypothetical mesonic atom, $K^+ K^-$ (kaonium), using the $K^+ K^- \to K^+ K^-$ elastic scattering amplitude. Our findings are in line with previously reported results, which involve solving an eigenvalue equation of the Kudryavtsev-Popov type. Using chiral perturbation theory, we show that kaonium manifests itself as a sharp resonance around 992 MeV accompanying $f_0 (980)$ or $a_0 (980)$ in cross-sections for processes $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ or $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta$. The latter process is particularly striking: the peak at the kaonium resonance energy is highly pronounced, with the ratio of the cross-sections $\sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta) / \sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0) \approx 9$. Due to the short lifetime of kaonium ($\sim 10^{-18}$ s) and its small decay width ($\sim 0.4$ keV), direct detection of this exotic atom poses a significant challenge and requires high experimental resolution. However, we show that once the formation of kaonium is considered in the cross-section, a better fit to the available experimental data is obtained.</description>

      <title>Parton distributions with higher twist and jet power corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a global determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) that accounts for higher twist corrections in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and linear power corrections for single inclusive jet and dijet production data from the LHC. We determine these corrections and their associated correlated uncertainties using a methodology based on the theory covariance formalism, previously used to account for nuclear uncertainties and missing higher order uncertainties (MHOUs) in global PDF determinations. We then study the impact of the power corrections on the extracted PDFs, and demonstrate an improved description of the data due to a reduced sensitivity to DIS data in the low-$x$ region where higher twist uncertainties are relatively large, and a reduced sensitivity to single inclusive jet data at relatively low $p_T$, where linear power corrections can be significant. Finally, we assess the impact of power corrections on observables relevant to LHC phenomenology, including Higgs production via gluon fusion, and the determination of $\alpha_s$. We find that these effects, while small, can be significant, improving perturbative convergence.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order analysis of $J/\psi + \gamma$ production in photon-photon collisions at CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the production of $J/\psi + \gamma$ in $\gamma\gamma$ collisions within nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization, with the direct-photon channel calculated specifically up to the next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$. Calculations for CEPC energy region show the resolved photon contribution is negligible, while the direct photon process dominates, yielding substantial annual $J/\psi$ yields. Significant modifications to $J/\psi$ polarization parameters emerge from color-octet mechanisms, and different NRQCD long distance matrix elements (LDMEs) further yield distinct polarization patterns. Furthermore, the polarization predictions are highly sensitive to the $^3P_J^{[8]}$ LDME, while being insensitive to the $^1S_0^{[8]}$ and $^3S_1^{[8]}$ LDMEs. Leveraging the cleaner environment of $e^+e^-$ collisions versus hadronic processes, the production of $J/\psi$ associated with a photon in $\gamma\gamma$ collisions provides a high-precision platform to test LDMEs universality and resolve longstanding $J/\psi$ polarization puzzles.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violation in Higgs boson decays at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the discovery potential for lepton flavor-violating Higgs boson decays, $h \to \ell_i \ell_j$ ($\ell_i \neq \ell_j$; $\ell = e, \mu, \tau$), in proton-proton collisions. The analysis is performed within a Froggatt-Nielsen framework, which offers a well-motivated theoretical mechanism for such processes. By performing a systematic scan over the phenomenologically viable parameter space, we identify regions that can yield observable signatures at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). For an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \gtrsim 1000~\text{fb}^{-1}$, we project that the channels $h \to e\mu$ and $h \to \tau\mu$ (with $\tau^{\pm} \to \pi^{\pm} \nu_{\tau}$) could reach the $5\sigma$ discovery threshold, while $h \to \tau e$ remains inaccessible even at $3000~\text{fb}^{-1}$. Our results highlight the unique capability of the HL-LHC to probe new physics through searches for rare Higgs decays.</description>

      <title>Revisiting lepton flavor violation: $\tau$ and meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal type-I seesaw model provides a simple explanation of neutrino flavor oscillations and induces charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV). Despite extensive previous studies, semileptonic cLFV channels remain underexplored. Using updated form factors, decay constants, and oscillation data, we revisit $\tau$ and meson decay channels, performing a systematic comparison across the seesaw parameter space. Surprisingly, we find that decays such as $\tau \to \ell\rho$ can dominate over purely leptonic $\tau$-sector probes, including $\tau\to 3\ell$ and even $\tau\to\ell\,\gamma$, in certain regions. In contrast, heavy-meson decays remain far below experimental sensitivity. Considering global constraints on the seesaw parameters, we derive branching ratios for the relevant cLFV processes and identify those within potential reach of next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing a minimal dark gauge sector via microlensing of compact dark objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal Dark Standard Model (DSM) consisting of a single spin-0 particle with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and completely decoupled from the visible sector. Characterized only by the scalar mass $\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark "mini-MACHOs". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\mu\gtrsim 10\,\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$. Our results represent a step forward in showing that purely gravitational observations can constrain the internal parameters of a dark gauge sector, and provide a framework for exploring broader DSM scenarios through future probes such as gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Superexotic $K^{*+}D^{*+}K^{*+}$ bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a system made from $K^{*+}D^{*+}K^{*+}$ with charge $3$, isospin $I=3/2$, spin $J=3$, and a quark content of $c\bar d \bar s u \bar s u$, which make it highly exotic relative to the standard $q\bar q$ structure of mesons. The interaction of the three body system is obtained starting from a cluster of $K^{*+}D^{*+}$ in $I=1$ and $J=2$, that in different works has been found bound, and adding to it an extra $K^{*+}$ with spin aligned with those of the vectors of the cluster. We find that the $K^* K^*$ interaction in $I=1$ and $J=2$ is repulsive, but its strength is small compared to that of $K^{*+}D^{*+}$ in $I=1$ and $J=2$, such that we find a three body state bound by about $100 \, \rm MeV$ with respect to the mass of a $K^{*+}$ and the $K^{*+} D^{*+}$ cluster. The width of the state, of about $10\, \rm MeV$, is much smaller than the binding, which facilitates its observation. We suggest to find that state by measuring the invariant mass of $K D K^*$, something feasible in present experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Unified study of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ and $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a unified description of the experimental data of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$, the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$, and the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)\pi^+ \pi^-)$. The strong final state interactions between the two pseudoscalars are taken into account using a parametrization fulfilling unitarity and analyticity. We find that there is universality in the coupling constants for $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ and $B_s^0 \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ processes. While the couplings of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^-$ are about half of magnitude smaller than the couplings of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$, which indicates that the $X(3872)$ is different from a pure charmonium state. Furthermore, we find that the $f_0(1500)$ plays an important role in the $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ and the $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ processes, though the phase space of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) f_0(1500)$ is small. Also we predict the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)\pi^+ \pi^-]$ and the $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass distribution of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)K^+K^-$.</description>

      <title>Kaon T-even transverse-momentum-dependent distributions and form factors in a self-consistent light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent light-front quark model (LFQM) for the kaon based on the Bakamjian--Thomas (BT) construction and apply it to the electromagnetic and scalar form factors, as well as the full set of unpolarized T-even transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) and their collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). A uniform implementation of the invariant mass $M_0$ in both the hadronic matrix elements and the associated Lorentz structures enforces four-momentum conservation at the meson--quark vertex and yields current-component--independent observables by consistently incorporating the light-front zero-mode structure required by covariance. The electromagnetic form factor $F_{K^+}(Q^2)$ is demonstrated to be unique by explicit computation from all available current components ($\gamma^+$, $\gamma^\perp$, and $\gamma^-$). In the scalar channel, we compare the direct $f_S(Q^2)$ and mass-factored $F_S(Q^2)$ definitions and show that they are not interchangeable within the BT-based LFQM, since the replacement $M\!\to\!M_0(x,\bm{k}_\perp)$ must be implemented at the integrand level. Using a Gaussian light-front wave function, the twist-2 TMD $f_1^q$ exhibits an exact Gaussian dependence in $\bm{k}_\perp$, while higher-twist TMDs ($f^{\perp q}$, $e^q$, $f_4^q$) display systematic twist and flavor hierarchies. We further analyze the perturbative QCD evolution of the valence PDFs for the pion and kaon and report their Mellin moments at representative scales, enabling direct comparison with phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Dirac-Majorana Confusion Theorem: The Role of CP-Violating Phases in New Physics Vector Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ``Practical Dirac-Majorana Confusion Theorem'' (PDMCT) asserts that phenomenological differences between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos are suppressed by $(m_\nu/E)^2$ in lepton-number-conserving processes, such that at high energy, it is impossible to experimentally distinguish between Dirac o Majorana neutrinos. In this work, we propose a generalization of this theorem by introducing a New Physics vector boson ($Z'$) with CP-violating, flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) couplings. While Fermi-Dirac statistics dictate that the flavor-diagonal vector current identically vanishes for Majorana neutrinos, we demonstrate that for non-diagonal transitions, the Majorana condition exactly cancels the real (CP-conserving) component of the vector interaction but keeping only the imaginary part induced by CP violation. Consequently, the kinematic mass suppression is lifted, and the difference in inclusive scattering cross-sections between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos becomes directly dependent on the FCNC CP-violating phase $\phi$. We apply this result to Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS), showing that for spin-zero targets, the distinguishability of the neutrino's nature is determined by the CP structure of the new interaction.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent treatment of repulsive corrections in HRG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reformulate the treatment of density-dependent chemical potential shifts appearing in excluded-volume implementations of the hadron resonance gas model. An auxiliary classical representation is constructed in which a common energy shift is determined by preserving the scalar number density, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Hadron radii are parametrized through a liquid-drop inspired mass-radius relation with two parameters: the pion radius and a scaling exponent. The resulting framework reproduces lattice QCD results for lower-order conserved-charge susceptibilities at zero chemical potentials with only two adjustable parameters.</description>

      <title>Holographic Bjorken flow of a hot and dense fluid in the vicinity of a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.00882v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use the gauge/gravity duality to perform the first systematic study of the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a hot and dense far-from-equilibrium strongly coupled relativistic fluid with a critical point. By employing a top-down holographic construction that stems from string theory, we numerically obtain the full nonlinear evolution of the far-from-equilibrium system undergoing a Bjorken expansion and address the following question: how does hydrodynamic behavior emerge in the vicinity of a critical point in the phase diagram? For the top-down holographic system analyzed in the present work, we find that the approach to hydrodynamics is strongly affected by the presence of the critical point: the closer the ratio between the chemical potential and the temperature is to its critical value, the longer it takes for the system to be well described by the equations of viscous hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>New bounds on Axion-Like Particles in the Ultraviolet from Legacy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The HST data consist of blank sky observations taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph in the 165--240~nm wavelength range, while the IUE data consist of observations of the Virgo Cluster obtained with the long- and short-wavelength spectrographs, covering 195--325~nm and 123--200~nm, respectively. We set a 95\% C.L. upper limit on the ALP--photon coupling $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across the whole probed ALP mass range. Notably, we rule out values of $g_{a\gamma}$ above $2.3 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses between 12.4 and 14.5\,eV, improving upon previous limits by a factor of seven.</description>

      <title>Opportunities for Imaging Light Nuclei with a Second Interaction Region at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will address several outstanding puzzles in modern nuclear physics. Key questions-such as the partonic structure of nucleons and nuclei and the origin of their mass and spin-can be explored through high-energy electron-proton and electron-nucleus collisions. To maximize its scientific reach, the EIC community has advocated for the addition of a second interaction region equipped with a detector complementary to the EIC general purpose collider detector, ePIC. The pre-conceptual design of this interaction region aims to provide a different configuration from the first interaction region, which enhances forward acceptance at very small scattering angles ($\theta \sim 0$ mrad). This machine configuration would significantly benefit exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics programs, complementing those of the ePIC experiment. In particular, accessing coherent diffractive processes on light nuclei by tagging of the full, intact nucleus is essential for mapping their spatial parton distributions. In this work, we present an exploratory study of the detection capabilities for light nuclei at a second EIC interaction region, with a detailed discussion of the accessible kinematic phase space and its implications for imaging.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the proton in the improved holographic QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the gluonic contribution to the gravitational form factors of the proton using the improved holographic QCD model, in which the proton is described in terms of bulk Dirac fermions. Model parameters are constrained using lattice and phenomenological input, allowing us to obtain estimates for the gravitational form factors and to compare them with results from other approaches. The resulting gluonic contribution to the $\mathcal{D}(t)$ form factor is found to exhibit an infrared pole in our framework. Using the extracted form factors, we analyze mechanical properties of the proton, including pressure and shear distributions. We obtain estimates of $\rho_{\text{mech}} = 0.95$ fm and $\rho_{\text{mass}} = 0.61$ fm for the mechanical and the mass radii of the proton, respectively, which are similar to other nonperturbative studies.</description>
