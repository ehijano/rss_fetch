      <title>Full Asymptotic Expansion of Monodromy Data for the First Painlev\'{e} Transcendent: Applications to Connection Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the full asymptotic expansion of the monodromy data ({\it i.e.}, Stokes multipliers) for the first Painlev\'{e} transcendent (PI) with large initial data or large pole parameters. Our primary approach involves refining the complex WKB method, also known as the method of uniform asymptotics, to approximate the second-order ODEs derived from PI's Lax pair with higher-order accuracy. As an application, we provide a rigorous proof of the full asymptotic expansion of the nonlinear eigenvalues proposed numerically by Bender, Komijani, and Wang. Additionally, we present the full asymptotic expansion for the pole parameters $(p_{n}, H_{n})$ corresponding to the $n$-th pole of the real tritronqu\'{e}e solution of the PI equation as $n \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Higher gauge theory and integrability</title>

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of integrable systems from a gauge theoretic perspective. This development originated with the introduction of $4$d Chern-Simons theory with defects, which provided a systematic framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach to studying higher-dimensional integrable models employing techniques from higher category theory. Starting with higher Chern-Simons theory on the $4$-manifold $\mathbb{R}\times Y$, we complexify and compactify the real line to $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and introduce the disorder defect $\omega=z^{-1}\mathrm{d} z $. This procedure defines a holomorphic five-dimensional variant of higher Chern-Simons theory, which, when endowed with suitable boundary conditions, allows for the localisation to a three-dimensional theory on $Y$. The equations of motion of the resulting model are equivalent to the flatness of a $2$-connection $(L,H)$, that we then use to construct the corresponding higher holonomies. We prove that these are invariants of homotopies relative boundary, which enables the construction of conserved quantities. The latter are labelled by both the categorical characters of a Lie crossed-module and the infinite number of homotopy classes of surfaces relative boundary in $Y$. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the $3$d theory has left and right acting symmetries whose current algebra is given by an infinite dimensional centrally extended affine Lie 2-algebra. Both of these conditions are direct higher homotopy analogues of the properties satisfied by the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten CFT, which we therefore interpret as facets of integrable structures.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>

Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.
  From a dynamical systems viewpoint, the message of the paper is that special families of birational maps with completely periodic dynamics under iteration admit natural deformations that are aperiodic yet completely integrable.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charge fluctuations from asymmetric initial states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conserved-charge densities are very special observables in quantum many-body systems as, by construction, they encode information about the dynamics. Therefore, their evolution is expected to be of much simpler interpretation than that of generic observables and to return universal information on the state of the system at any given time. Here we study the dynamics of the fluctuations of conserved U(1) charges in systems that are prepared in charge-asymmetric initial states. We characterise the charge fluctuations in a given subsystem using the full-counting statistics of the truncated charge and the quantum entanglement between the subsystem and the rest resolved to the symmetry sectors of the charge. We show that, even though the initial states considered are homogeneous in space, the charge fluctuations generate an effective inhomogeneity due to the charge-asymmetric nature of the initial states. We use this observation to map the problem into that of charge fluctuations on inhomogeneous, charge-symmetric states and treat it using a recently developed space-time duality approach. Specialising the treatment to interacting integrable systems we combine the space-time duality approach with generalised hydrodynamics to find explicit predictions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotical dynamics of askew-polarized spinning top under the radiation reaction torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotary dynamics of polarized composite particles as dipole rigid bodies is considered. It is described the Euler equations singularly perturbed by the radiation reaction torque. The Schott term is taken into account, and the reduction procedure lowering higher derivatives is applied. Asymptotic methods of nonlinear mechanics are used to analyze the rotary dynamics of askew-polarized spinning top. Numerical estimates are relevant to the hypothetical DAST-nanocrystals that might possess a huge dipole moment.</description>
