      <title>Demonstrating Correlation Trends in the Electric Dipole Polarizabilities of Many Low-lying States in Cesium (Cs I) through First-principle Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron correlation and higher-order relativistic effects are probed in the evaluation of scalar and tensor static electric dipole (E1) polarizabilities ($\alpha_d$) of several even- and odd-parity states in cesium (Cs) using the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, second-order perturbation theory (MBPT(2)), third-order perturbation theory (MBPT(3)), random phase approximation (RPA), and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster (RCCSD) method. To account for perturbation due to odd-parity E1 operator on the atomic orbitals, calculations are carried out in the linear response approach. Our final $\alpha_d$ values, with the estimated uncertainties, show reasonably good agreement with the previous calculations and available experimental results. Differences among the DHF, MBPT(2), MBPT(3) and RPA results indicate pair-correlation (PC) effects play major roles than the core-polarization (CP) effects in the determination of $\alpha_d$ values in Cs. From the differences among the MBPT(3) and RCC results, we find correlations among the PC and CP effects and double CP effects together are also significant in these calculations. Contributions from the Breit interactions are found to be quite large in the high-lying states.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of Electric Quadrupole Moments and Isotope Shift Constants of Yb$^+$ in Pursuance of Probing Fundamental Physics and Nuclear Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemplating to register signature of a new vector boson unambiguously from the measured non-linear isotope shift (IS) effects in three recent experiments [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 12}, 021033 (2022); Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 163201 (2022) and Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 134}, 063002 (2025)], very precise values of quadrupole moments and IS constants for the $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 5d ~ ^2D_{3/2}$ and $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 5d ~ ^2D_{5/2}$ clock transitions of $^{171}$Yb$^+$ are presented. This is accomplished by incorporating contributions from the computationally challenging triply excited configurations through the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. Testament of quality atomic wave functions of states of the above transitions, obtained using the RCC theory, are gauged by comparing the calculated energies and magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants with their measurements. The improved quadrupole moments from this work will be immensely useful to estimate quadrupole shifts of the clock transitions of Yb$^+$. Complementary approaches are employed to ascertain accuracy and comprehend roles of orbital relaxation and correlation effects in evaluating the IS constants. Combining these constants with the IS measurements from Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 163201 (2022), differential nuclear charge radii of the Yb isotopes are inferred that deviate by 6-7\% from the literature data.</description>

      <title>Quantum-amplified global-phase spectroscopy on an optical clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) are at the forefront of precision metrology, operating near a standard quantum limit (SQL) set by quantum noise. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit, yet there remain practical roadblocks concerning scalability and measurement resolution requirements. Here, we adapt the holonomic quantum-gate concept to develop a novel Rabi-type "global-phase spectroscopy" (GPS) that utilizes the detuning-sensitive global Aharanov-Anandan phase. With this approach, we are able to demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy in an OLC that achieves 2.4(7) dB metrological gain without subtracting the laser noise, and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the SQL. We further introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light-atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-canceling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily owing to the global nature of entangling interaction, and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits.</description>

      <title>Sub-second spin and lifetime-limited optical coherences in $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75 ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15 seconds at zero magnetic field between 50 mK and 1 K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. We unify examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys. Rev. A 107, 013722 (2023) and Phys. Rev. Research 3, 023079 (2021), while reaffirming the prior treatment and conclusions reported in Phys. Rev. Research 3, 013116 (2021).</description>

      <title>High-energy polarized electron beams from the ionization of isolated spin polarized hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a laser-based method for the preparation of high-energy polarized electrons, from the ionization of isolated spin-polarized hydrogen (SPH) atoms. The SPH atoms are prepared from the photodissociation of HCl, using two consecutive UV pulses of ps duration. By appropriately timing and focusing the pulses, we can spatially separate the highly polarized SPH from other unwanted photoproducts, which then act as the target for the acceleration lasers. We show how elastic collisions define number density $n$ and polarization P regimes ($10^{16}\leq$ $n$ $\leq 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, 0.99 $\geq$ P $\geq$ 0.40) for the pre-polarized targets, and use particle-in-cell simulations to demonstrate the method's feasibility.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Multidisciplinary Science in the Multimessenger Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>
