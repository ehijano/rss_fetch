      <title>A Knowledge Producer's View on the Knowledge Commons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardin introduced the notorious concept of "tragedy of the commons". Worrying about the consequences of human overpopulation on the planet, he discussed "hard problems": problems with no technical solutions, that can only be addressed by way of an evolving morality. Hardin's tragedy of the commons predicts that the hard problem of human population growth directly implies a hard problem of overuse or pollution of the commons. This paper focuses on the knowledge commons. A technical proposal is presented, based on a JSON schema for structuring pieces of knowledge. This is used to show that even if the knowledge commons satisfies the necessary conditions of the tragedy of the commons, the ensuing problems are not necessarily hard. Some can be made trivial by relying on traditional principles implemented in a technical framework.</description>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of the Initial Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bibliographic data is a rich source of information that goes beyond the use cases of location and citation -- it also encodes both cultural and technological context. For most of its existence, the scholarly record has changed slowly and hence provides an opportunity to gain insight through its reflection of the cultural norms of the research community over the last four centuries. While it is often difficult to distinguish the originating driver of change, it is still valuable to consider the motivating influences that have led to changes in the structure of the scholarly record. An ``initial era'' is identified during which initials were used in preference to full names by authors on scholarly communications. Causes of the emergence and demise of this era are considered as well as the implications of this era on research culture and practice.</description>
