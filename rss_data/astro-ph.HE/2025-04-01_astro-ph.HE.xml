      <title>Searching for exotic object companions in the dense core of NGC 362: a multi-wavelength and multi-epoch photometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense cores of globular clusters (GCs) are efficient environments for the production of exotic stellar populations, including millisecond pulsars (MSPs), low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs). Most of these objects likely form through two- and three-body interactions and are useful tracers of the cluster's dynamical evolution. In this work we explore the exotic object population in the galactic GC NGC 362, searching for the optical counterpart of 33 X-ray sources identified within 1 arcmin from the cluster center. To this aim, we exploit a large Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data-set, obtained in eight different epochs and covering a wavelength range from near UV to the optical I band. To identify the most promising counterparts we follow a multi-step analysis, which is based on four main ingredients, namely positional coincidence, position in the colour-magnitude-diagrams (CMDs), H$\alpha$ excess and photometric variability. In addition, we complement the photometric analysis with spectroscopic information coming from the analysis of MUSE radial velocity (RV) curves. Thanks to this multi-diagnostic approach, we are able to identify 28 high-confidence optical counterparts, including several candidate MSPs, active binaries (ABs) and CVs. The most intriguing counterparts include a candidate black widow (BW) system, an eclipsing binary blue straggler, and a system in outburst, potentially representing either a LMXB or a nova eruption from a CV. The candidate MSPs proposed in this work will contribute to ongoing radio analyses with MeerKAT for the identification and detailed study of MSPs in NGC 362.</description>

      <title>A generalized method to measure the Lorentz factor from gamma-ray burst photospheric emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are inferred from observations depend on the value of the bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$. Consequently, accurately estimating it is an important aim. In this work, we present a method of measuring $\Gamma$ based on observed photospheric emission, which can also be used for highly dissipative flows that may lead to non-thermal spectral shapes. For the method to be applicable, two conditions need to be met: the photon number should be conserved in the later stages of the jet, and the original photon temperature must be inferred from the data. The case of dissipation via subphotospheric shocks is discussed in detail, and we show that the method is particularly efficient when a low-energy spectral break is identified. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by applying it to two different GRB spectra. From one of the spectra, we obtain a value for $\Gamma$ with statistical uncertainties of only $\sim 15$\%, while for the other spectrum we only obtain an upper limit.</description>

      <title>The Optical to X-ray Luminosity and Spectrum of Supernova Wind Breakouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations indicate that optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) at radii of $10^{14}-10^{15}$ cm around core-collapse supernovae (SN) progenitors is common. The breakout of the SN radiation-mediated shock (RMS) through such CSM leads to the formation of a collisionless shock (CLS). We analyze the evolution of the shock structure and associated radiation field during and after the RMS-CLS transition for non-relativistic breakouts (breakout shock velocity $v_{\rm bo}=10^9v_9~{\rm cm/s}&lt;0.1c$) through a hydrogen-rich CSM "wind" density profile, $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, with breakout radius $R_{{\rm bo}}=10^{14}R_{14}$ cm much larger than the progenitor radius. An analytic description of the key properties of the emitted optical to X-ray radiation is provided, supported by numeric radiation-hydrodynamics calculations that self-consistently describe the time-dependent spatial distribution of the plasma and radiation, governed by the interplay between Bremsstrahlung emission/absorption and inelastic Compton scattering. We show that the characteristic energy of the photons carrying most of the luminosity, $\approx10^{43}R_{14}v_9^2$ erg/s, shifts from UV to X-ray, reaching 1 keV as the shock reaches $\approx3R_{\rm bo}$. The X-ray signal is not suppressed by propagation through the upstream wind, and its absence may suggest that the dense CSM does not extend much beyond $R_{\rm bo}$. Our results provide the basis for a quantitative calculation of the high energy $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission that is expected from particles accelerated at the CLS, and will allow using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young SNe, particularly ULTRASAT, to infer the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent AGN Disc Winds II -- Effects of Photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a combination of radiation hydrodynamics (rad-HD) and photoionization modeling to study line-driven disc winds for a range of black hole masses. We refined previous models by incorporating heating, cooling, and radiation forces from spectral lines calculated using a photoionization code, assuming that composite AGN spectra irradiate the gas. For black holes with masses $3 \times 10^{6} \lesssim {\rm M_{BH}/M_{\odot}} \lesssim 10^{8}$, the mass loss rate, ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ increases proportionally with the disk Eddington fraction, $\Gamma$. The insensitivity of ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ to the hardness of the spectral energy distribution (SED) arises because the central region is dominated by radiation in the frequency range with ample spectral lines for the range of $M_{BH}$ considered here. Disc winds are suppressed or fail outside the above mass range because of a dearth of line-driving photons. We find \emph{stronger} winds, both in terms of ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ and wind velocity compared to previous disc wind models. Our winds are stronger because of an enhanced line force from including many spectral lines in the X-ray band. These lines were unavailable and, hence, unaccounted for in previous photoionization studies and their subsequent application to AGN wind models. For $\Gamma \gtrsim 0.4$, ${\rm \dot{M}_w}$ is higher than the assumed disc accretion rate, implying that the wind feeds back strongly. Our findings indicate the necessity of utilizing comprehensive and current atomic data along with a more thorough approach to radiation transfer - both spatially and temporally - to accurately calculate the line force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By consideration of the Compact object HESS J1731-347 as a hybrid twin compact star, i.e., a more compact star than its hadronic twin of the same mass, its stellar properties are derived. Besides showing that the properties of compact stars in this work are in good agreement with state-of-the-art constraints both from measurements carried out in laboratory experiments as well as by multi-messenger astronomy observations, the realization of an early strong hadron-quark first order phase transition as implied by the twins is discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray propagation features in gamma-ray measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray measurements from GeV to PeV energies have provided us with a wealth of information on diffuse emission and sources in the Universe lately. With improved spatial and temporal resolutions together with real-time multimessenger astronomy, the modeling of 3D cosmic-ray transport becomes more and more important to explain the data. Here, we will give a compact summary of how cosmic-ray propagation in very different astrophysical environments like the Sun, Milky Way, and active galaxies can be constrained by combining 3D modeling with the propagation software CRPropa with gamma-ray measurements.</description>

      <title>Polarization Position Angle Swing and the Rotating Vector Model of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs), typically highly polarized, usually have a nearly constant polarization position angle (PA) during each burst. Some bursts show significant PA variations, and one of them was claimed to have a PA variation pattern consistent with the prediction of the rotating vector model (RVM) commonly adopted to fit the PA variations in radio pulsars. We systematically study the PA evolution pattern of 1727 bursts from three active repeating FRB sources monitored by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). We identify 46 bursts whose PA variations are fully consistent with the RVM. However, the inferred geometrical parameters and rotation periods derived from these RVM fitting are inconsistent from each other. This suggests that the magnetosphere of the FRB central engine is constantly distorted by the FRB emitter, and the magnetic configuration is dynamically evolving.</description>

      <title>The Timing and Polarization of PSR J0002+6216</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined timing analysis of data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) confirmed that PSR J0002+6216 is not a hyper-velocity (exceeding 1000 km s$^{-1}$) pulsar. From this analysis, we determined the total proper motion of PSR J0002+6216 to be $\mu_{\rm tot}=39.05\pm15.79$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements to within 0.24$\sigma$. Moreover, two glitches were detected for the first time, which occurred on MJD 58850(17) and MJD 60421(6), respectively. The second glitch exhibited an exponential recovery process, with $Q = 0.0090(3)$ and $\tau_{\rm d} = 45(3)$ days. Additionally, with FAST high-sensitivity observations, we measured the interstellar rotation measure (RM) and the three-dimensional (3D) orientation of the spin axis for the first time, and updated the dispersion measure (DM) of PSR J0002+6216. Currently, no variations in RM or DM have been detected. By combining the measured RM with the observed position angle of the spin axis, we determined that the intrinsic position angle of the pulsar's spin axis is $\psi_{0}(\text{intrinsic}) = 89.9^{\circ} \pm 4.6^{\circ}$. When we compared this with the proper motion position angle obtained from VLBI, we found a misalignment of approximately 23$^{\circ}$ between the spin and velocity angles of PSR J0002+6216. At present, pulsars with 2D spin-velocity angle measurements are unable to fully test the Janka et al.(2022) model. However, with more high-precision observational data in the future, we will be able to further test models related to pulsar birth.</description>

      <title>Flux variations and torque reversals of Cen X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cen X-3 is an archetypical X-ray pulsar with strong flux variations and alternating torque reversals, both of which are similar to those of recently discovered pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray sources. We study a low state of Cen X-3 occurred in 2023 lasting for $\sim100$ days with Chandra and Insight-HXMT observations, supplemented with MAXI and Fermi/GBM data. The Chandra spectrum during the eclipse of Cen X-3 in the low state is very similar to that in the high state, especially, the Fe lines. The HXMT spectrum in the low state shows an enhanced Fe line, so do the MAXI data. The spin-up/spin-down trends of Cen X-3 are not affected by the low states. All these results indicate that the intrinsic emission in the low states is high, and the low states are just apparently low and are dominated by reprocessed emission. We found that the spin-up to spin-down reversals of Cen X-3 take longer time than the spin-down to spin-up reversals, which provides a definite observation test of any possible torque-reversal models. We discuss insights of these results for understanding the pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Higher multipoles of the cow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical cow approximation is widely used in the literature, but is rarely justified. Here, I propose several schemes for extending the spherical cow approximation to a full multipole expansion, in which the spherical cow is simply the first term. This allows for the computation of bovine potentials and interactions beyond spherical symmetry, and also provides a scheme for defining the geometry of the cow itself at higher multipole moments. This is especially important for the treatment of physical processes that are suppressed by spherical symmetry, such as the spindown of a rotating cow due to the emission of gravitational waves. I demonstrate the computation of multipole coefficients for a benchmark cow, and illustrate the applicability of the multipolar cow to several important problems.</description>

      <title>Study of Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Source 1LHAASO J0056+6346u and Its Possible Origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a dedicated study of the newly discovered extended UHE $\gamma$-ray source 1LHAASO J0056+6346u. Analyzing 979 days of LHAASO-WCDA data and 1389 days of LHAASO-KM2A data, we observed a significant excess of $\gamma$-ray events with both WCDA and KM2A. Assuming a point power-law source with a fixed spectral index, the significance maps reveal excesses of ${\sim}12.65\,\sigma$, ${\sim}22.18\,\sigma$, and ${\sim}10.24\,\sigma$ in the energy ranges of 1--25 TeV, 25--100 TeV, and $&gt; 100$ TeV, respectively. We use a 3D likelihood algorithm to derive the morphological and spectral parameters, and the source is detected with significances of $12.65\,\sigma$ by WCDA and $25.27\,\sigma$ by KM2A. The best-fit positions derived from WCDA and KM2A data are (R.A. = $13.96^\circ\pm0.09^\circ$, Decl. = $63.92^\circ\pm0.05^\circ$) and (R.A. = $14.00^\circ\pm0.05^\circ$, Decl. = $63.79^\circ\pm0.02^\circ$), respectively. The angular size ($r_{39}$) of 1LHAASO J0056+6346u is $0.34^\circ\pm0.04^\circ$ at 1--25 TeV and $0.24^\circ\pm0.02^\circ$ at $&gt; 25$ TeV. The differential flux of this UHE $\gamma$-ray source can be described by an exponential cutoff power-law function: $(2.67\pm0.25) \times 10^{-15} (E/20\,\text{TeV})^{-1.97\pm0.10} e^{-E/(55.1\pm7.2)\,\text{TeV}} \,\text{TeV}^{-1}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$. To explore potential sources of $\gamma$-ray emission, we investigated the gas distribution around 1LHAASO J0056+6346u. 1LHAASO J0056+6346u is likely to be a TeV PWN powered by an unknown pulsar, which would naturally explain both its spatial and spectral properties. Another explanation is that this UHE $\gamma$-ray source might be associated with gas content illuminated by a nearby CR accelerator, possibly the SNR candidate G124.0+1.4.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new flaring class in GRS 1915+105 using AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly variable Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXB) GRS~1915+105 has shown many flaring classes when the source oscillates between the High Soft state (HS) and the Hard Intermediate state (HIMS) with a transition time of less than 10 s. The X-ray flux is anti-correlated with hardness ratio (HR2) during these X-ray flaring classes. We have analyzed Astrosat/LAXPC \&amp; SXT data and report here a new X-ray flaring class named $\eta$ class when the source oscillates between two HS states (the power-law index is always greater than 4) with transition time around 50 s. The X-ray flux is correlated with hardness ratio. This class is quasi-regular, and we have detected High Frequency Quasi Periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) around 70 Hz during this new flaring class. The accretion rate changes by a factor of three over the burst cycle. We report here the results of our extensive study of spectral and timing characteristics of this new class.</description>

      <title>A multi-modal infant-based metric for choosing the best supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of 22 core-collapse supernovae (SNe), selected to explore a novel, multidimensional ranking scheme aimed at identifying the best supernova. Each SN is evaluated based on three principal criteria: (1) inferred explosion energy derived from light curve modeling and spectroscopic indicators; (2) an aesthetic score assigned to the SN host galaxy following transformation into a human face using a generative visual model (Midjourney v5); and (3) final ranking by Claud.IA, a 6-month-old infant trained to select the best SN via repeated exposure to curated SN images. We define and normalize all criteria to ensure statistical consistency across the sample, with particular attention paid to the biases inherent in infant-based classification models. The top five SNe exhibit both high explosion energies (E &gt; 1e51 erg) and extremely cool host galaxies (post transformation), with Claud.IA showing strong preferences toward galaxies exhibiting symmetric facial morphology and prominent spiral arms. Final application of Claud.IA identified the best supernova in our sample as SN 2022joj. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating human-machine hybrid aesthetic judgment and early developmental cognition into astrophysical classification, and raises intriguing questions about the nature of bestness in cosmic explosions.

      <title>Lorentz Invariance Violation from Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LV) is examined through the time delay between high-energy and low-energy photons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previous studies determined the LV energy scale as $E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3.60 \times 10^{17}$~GeV using Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) data. This study updates the time-delay model and reaffirms these findings with new observations. High-energy photons from GRBs at GeV and TeV bands are analyzed, including the 99.3 GeV photon from GRB 221009A (FGST), the 1.07 TeV photon from GRB 190114C (MAGIC), and the 12.2 TeV photon from GRB 221009A (LHAASO). Our analysis, in conjunction with previous data, consistently shows that high-energy photons are emitted earlier than low-energy photons at the source. By evaluating 17 high-energy photons from 10 GRBs observed by FGST, MAGIC, and LHAASO, we estimate the LV energy scale to be $E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3.00 \times 10^{17}$ GeV. The null hypothesis of dispersion-free vacuum $E=pc$ (or, equivalently, the constant light-speed $v_{\gamma}=c$) is rejected at a significance level of 3.1$\sigma$ or higher.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the FRB Population Observed Through Galaxy Cluster Lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High redshift Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are expected to be extremely powerful probes of our Universe. However, while a significant number of FRBs are expected to exist at high redshift, detecting them has been difficult, with only a handful robustly confirmed at redshifts greater than one. In many other fields, gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters has enabled high redshift detections by magnifying background sources. In this work we forecast the populations of FRBs expected to be detected by CHIME and upcoming instrument CHORD, for blank fields and by lensing through a range of strong lensing galaxy clusters, based on existing, observationally driven cluster models. We find that the presence of a galaxy cluster of mass $M\geq5\times10^{14} M_\odot$ within the detection beam of a transit telescope will approximately double the rate of detected high redshift ($z\geq1$ CHIME, $z\geq2$ CHORD) FRBs for that beam. Consequently, we find that knowledge of cluster positions can be used by instruments like CHIME or CHORD in tandem with novel observational strategies to isolate a sample of high redshift FRBs with $\gtrsim50\%$ purity at rate of $\lesssim3$ per year. This would provide a statistically high redshift sample of mostly gravitationally lensed FRBs, that would be ideal candidates for optical follow-up, constraining the FRB-star formation relation and for use in cosmological studies including measuring $H_0$, characterising dark matter substructures and probing reionization.</description>

      <title>20 years of disk winds in 4U 1630-47 -- I. Long-term behavior and influence of hard X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly ionized X-ray wind signatures have been found in the soft states of high-inclination Black Hole Low Mass X-ray Binaries (BHLMXBs) for more than two decades. Yet signs of a systematic evolution of the outflow itself along the outburst remain elusive, due to the limited sampling of individual sources and the necessity to consider the broad-band evolution of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). We perform an holistic analysis of archival X-ray wind signatures in the most observed wind-emitting transient BHLMXB to date, 4U 1630-47 . The combination of Chandra, NICER, NuSTAR, Suzaku, and XMM-Newton, complemented in hard X-rays by Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL, spans more than 200 individual days over 9 individual outbursts, and provides a near complete broad-band coverage of the brighter portion of the outburst. Our results show that the hard X-rays allow to define "soft" states with ubiquitous wind detections, and their contribution is strongly correlated with the Equivalent Width (EW) of the lines. We then constrain the evolution of the outflow in a set of representative observations, using thermal stability curves and photoionization modeling. The former confirms that the switch to unstable SEDs occurs well after the wind signatures disappear, to the point where the last canonical hard states are thermally stable. The latter shows that intrinsic changes in the outflow are required to explain the main correlations of the line EWs, be it with luminosity or the hard X-rays. These behaviors are seen systematically over all outbursts and confirm individual links between the wind properties, the thermal disk, and the corona.</description>

Abstract: This document summarises discussions on future directions in theoretical neutrino physics, which are the outcome of a neutrino theory workshop held at CERN in February 2025. The starting point is the realisation that neutrino physics offers unique opportunities to address some of the most fundamental questions in physics. This motivates a vigorous experimental programme which the theory community fully supports. \textbf{A strong effort in theoretical neutrino physics is paramount to optimally take advantage of upcoming neutrino experiments and to explore the synergies with other areas of particle, astroparticle, and nuclear physics, as well as cosmology.} Progress on the theory side has the potential to significantly boost the physics reach of experiments, as well as go well beyond their original scope. Strong collaboration between theory and experiment is essential in the precision era. To foster such collaboration, \textbf{we propose to establish a CERN Neutrino Physics Centre.} Taking inspiration from the highly successful LHC Physics Center at Fermilab, the CERN Neutrino Physics Centre would be the European hub of the neutrino community, covering experimental and theoretical activities.</description>

      <title>The International Axion Observatory (IAXO): case, status and plans. Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The International Axion Observatory (IAXO) is a next-generation axion helioscope designed to search for solar axions with unprecedented sensitivity. IAXO holds a unique position in the global landscape of axion searches, as it will probe a region of the axion parameter space inaccessible to any other experiment. In particular, it will explore QCD axion models in the mass range from meV to eV, covering scenarios motivated by astrophysical observations and potentially extending to axion dark matter models. Several studies in recent years have demonstrated that IAXO has the potential to probe a wide range of new physics beyond solar axions, including dark photons, chameleons, gravitational waves, and axions from nearby supernovae. IAXO will build upon the two-decade experience gained with CAST, the detailed studies for BabyIAXO, which is currently under construction, as well as new technologies. If, in contrast to expectations, solar axion searches with IAXO ``only'' result in limits on new physics in presently uncharted parameter territory, these exclusions would be very robust and provide significant constraints on models, as they would not depend on untestable cosmological assumptions.</description>

      <title>Curved spacetimes with continuous light disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly curved spacetimes of compact astrophysical objects are known to possess light rings (null circular geodesics) with {\it discrete} radii on which massless particles can perform closed circular motions. In the present compact paper, we reveal for the first time the existence of isotropic curved spacetimes that possess light disks which are made of a {\it continuum} of closed light rings. In particular, using analytical techniques which are based on the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations, we prove that these physically intriguing spacetimes contain a central compact core of radius $r_-&gt;0$ that supports an outer spherical shell with an infinite number (a continuum) of null circular geodesic which are all characterized by the functional relations $4\pi r^2_{\gamma}p(r_{\gamma})=1-3m(r_{\gamma})/r_{\gamma}$ and $8\pi r^2_{\gamma}(\rho+p)=1$ for $r_{\gamma}\in[r_-,r_+]$ [here $\{\rho,p\}$ are respectively the energy density and the isotropic pressure of the self-gravitating matter fields and $m(r)$ is the gravitational mass contained within the sphere of radius $r$].</description>

      <title>The global energetics of radio AGN kinetic feedback in the local universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [abridged] AGN feedback is a crucial ingredient for understanding galaxy evolution. However, a complete quantitative time-dependent framework, including the dependence of such feedback on AGN, host galaxy, and host halo properties, is yet to be developed. Using the complete sample of 682 radio AGN from the LOFAR-eFEDS survey ($z&lt;0.4$), we derive the average jet power of massive galaxies and its variation as a function of stellar mass ($M_*$), halo mass ($M_h$) and radio morphology. We compare the incidence distributions of compact and complex radio AGN as a function of specific black hole kinetic power, $\lambda_{\rm Jet}$, and synthesise, for the first time, the radio luminosity function (RLF) by $M_*$ and radio morphology. Our RLF and derived total radio AGN kinetic luminosity density, $\log \Omega_{\rm kin}/[\rm {W~Mpc^{-3}}]=32.15_{-0.34}^{+0.18}$, align with previous work. We find that kinetic feedback from radio AGN dominates over any plausible inventory of radiatively-driven feedback for galaxies with $\log M_*/M_\odot &gt; 10.6$. More specifically, it is the compact radio AGN which dominate this global kinetic energy budget for all but the most massive galaxies ($10.6 &lt; \log M_*/M_{\odot} &lt; 11.5$). Subsequently, we compare the average injected jet energy against the galaxy and halo binding energy, and against the total thermal energy of the host gas within halos. We find that radio AGN cannot fully unbind their host galaxies nor host halos. However, they have enough energy to impact the global thermodynamical heating and cooling balance in small halos and significantly contribute to offsetting local cooling flows in even the most massive clusters cores. Overall, our findings provide important insights on jet powering, accretion processes and black hole-galaxy coevolution via AGN feedback, as well as a clear observational benchmark to calibrate AGN feedback simulations.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric absorption of dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, the interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter is assumed to be very small. Nevertheless, in this article, I show that the effective resonant absorption of dark photon dark matter in the atmosphere is definitely possible. This might also be associated with the alleged temperature anomalies observed in our upper stratosphere. By allowing a small amount of additional energy deposition to our upper stratosphere, a narrow dark matter mass range $m_A \sim 0.0001-0.001$ eV and the corresponding range of the mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ are constrained for the first time. This proposal might overturn our usual assumption of extremely weak interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter and revive the hope of detecting dark matter directly. Some important implications of this proposal such as the heating of planets and supermassive dark stars would also be discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel exact solution to the gravitational field equations, known as the Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia black hole solution, set against the backdrop of anti-de Sitter space and surrounded by a quintessence field. This solution serves as an interpolation between three distinct anti-de Sitter black hole configurations, namely, the Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia, Schwarzschild-Kiselev, and the standard Schwarzschild black hole solutions. The first aspect of our investigation focuses on the geodesic motion of particles, where we explore how the black hole's space-time geometry-incorporating the effects of nonlinear electrodynamics, the quintessence field, and the curvature radius-influences the dynamics of both massless and massive particles near the black hole. To further enrich our analysis, we extend the study to include the perturbative dynamics of a massless scalar field within the black hole solution, placing special emphasis on the scalar perturbative potential. Subsequently, we focus into the phenomenon of black hole shadows, examining how various parameters, such as the nonlinear electrodynamics, the curvature of space-time and the presence of the quintessence field, impact the size and shape of the shadow cast by the black hole. In the final segment of our study, we shift our attention to the thermodynamics of the black hole solution. We compute several essential thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature, specific heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, analyzing how these properties evolve in response to changes in the various parameters that define the space-time geometry, which in turn affect the gravitational field when compared to the traditional black hole</description>

      <title>Twisted magnetar magnetospheres: a class of semi-analytical force-free non-rotating solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetospheric twists, that is magnetospheres with a toroidal component, are under scrutiny due to the key role the twist is believed to play in the behaviour of neutron stars. Notably, its dissipation is believed to power magnetar activity, and is an important element of the evolution of these stars. We exhibit a new class of twisted axi-symmetric force-free magnetospheric solutions. We solve the Grad-Shafranov equation by introducing an ansatz akin to a multipolar expansion. We obtain a hierarchical system of ordinary differential equations where lower-order multipoles source the higher-order ones. We show that analytical approximations can be obtained, and that in general solutions can be numerically computed using standard solvers. We obtain a class of solutions with a great flexibility in initial conditions, and show that a subset of these asymptotically tend to vacuum. The twist is not confined to a subset of field lines. The solutions are symmetric about the equator, with a toroidal component that can be reversed. This symmetry is supported by an equatorial current sheet. We provide a first-order approximation of a particular solution that consists in the superposition of a vacuum dipole and a toroidal magnetic field sourced by the dipole, where the toroidal component decays as $1/r^4$. As an example of strongly multipolar solution, we also exhibit cases with an additional octupole component.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of $d^*$ hexaquarks on quark deconfinement and hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the $d^*$(2380) hexaquark on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter within hybrid stars (HSs) using the Chiral Mean-Field model (CMF). The hexaquark is included as a new degree of freedom in the hadronic phase, and its influence on the deconfinement transition to quark matter is explored. We re-parametrize the CMF model to ensure compatibility with recent astrophysical constraints, including the observation of massive pulsars and gravitational wave events. Our results show that the presence of $d^*$ significantly modifies the EoS, leading to a softening at high densities and a consequent reduction in the predicted maximum stellar masses. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of a first-order deconfinement phase transition within the context of the extended stability branch of slow stable HSs (SSHSs). We find that the presence of hexaquarks can delay the deconfinement phase transition and reduce the associated energy density gap, affecting the structure and stability of HSs. Our results suggest that, as the hexaquark appearance tends to destabilize stellar configurations, fine tuning of model parameters is required to obtain both the presence of hexaquarks and quark deconfinement in these systems. In this scenario, the SSHS branch plays a crucial role in obtaining HSs with hexaquarks that satisfy current astrophysical constraints. Our work provides new insights into the role of exotic particles like $d^*$ in dense matter and the complex interplay between hadronic and quark degrees of freedom inside compact stellar objects.</description>

      <title>UVIT Data Release version 7: Regenerated high-level UVIT data products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat is an active telescope capable of high-resolution far-ultraviolet imaging (&lt;1.5'') and low resolution (${\lambda}/{\delta}{\lambda}$ $\approx$ 100) slitless spectroscopy with a field of view as large as ~0.5 degrees. Now almost a decade old, UVIT continues to be operational and generates valuable data for the scientific community. UVIT is also capable of near-ultraviolet imaging (&lt;1.5''); however, the near-ultraviolet channel stopped working in August 2018 after providing data for nearly three years. This article gives an overview of the latest version (7.0.1) of the UVIT pipeline and UVIT Data Release version 7. The high-level products generated using pipeline versions having a major version number of seven will be called "UVIT Data Release version 7". The latest pipeline version overcomes the two limitations of the previous version (6.3), namely (a) the inability to combine all episode-wise images and (b) the failure of the astrometry module in a large fraction of the observations. The procedures adopted to overcome these two limitations, as well as a comparison of the performance of this new version over the previous one, are presented in this paper. The UVIT Data Release version 7 products are available at the Indian Space Science Data Center of the Indian Space Research Organisation for archival and dissemination from 01 June 2024. The new pipeline version is open source and made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>General relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of binary strange star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic simulations of binary strange star mergers considering two different approaches for thermal effects. The first uses a cold equation of state (EOS) derived from a modified version of the MIT bag model which is then supplemented by a $\Gamma$-law correction. The second approach employs a microphysical description of the finite-temperature effects. We describe results obtained with the two treatments, highlighting the influence of thermal effects. We find that the postmerger dynamics differs significantly in the two cases, leading to quantitative differences in the postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and ejecta mass. The peak frequency of the postmerger gravitational-wave emission is consistent with the established quasi-universal relations for binary neutron star mergers and as a result, our simulations cannot distinguish between mergers of neutron stars and those of strange stars. Our models with realistic treatment of finite-temperature effects produce a significant amount of ejecta $\gtrsim 0.02\ M_{\odot}$. The resulting flux of strangelets near the Earth, computed assuming that all neutron star mergers are in fact strange-stars mergers and that the binary considered here is representative, is in tension with experimental upper limits. As such, our results tentatively disfavor a scenario in which strange-quark matter is the lowest energy state of matter.</description>

      <title>Signatures of anti-social mass-loss in the ordinary Type II SN 2024bch -- A non-interacting supernova with early high-ionisation features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the spectro-photometric properties of the Type II supernova \sn, exploded in NGC~3206 at a distance of $19.9\,\rm{Mpc}$. Its early spectra are characterised by narrow high-ionisation emission lines, often interpreted as signatures of ongoing interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a confined dense circumstellar medium. However, we provide a model for the bolometric light curve of the transient that does not require sources of energy different than radioactive decays and H recombination. Our model can reproduce the bolometric light curve of SN~2024bch adopting an ejected mass of $M_{bulk}\simeq5$\msun~surrounded by an extended envelope of only 0.2\msun~with an outer radius $R_{env}=7.0\times10^{13}\,\rm{cm}$. An accurate modelling focused on the radioactive part of the light curve, which accounts for incomplete $\gamma-$ray trapping, gives a $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ mass of 0.048\msun. We propose narrow lines to be powered by Bowen fluorescence induced by scattering of \ion{He}{II} Ly$\alpha$ photons, resulting in the emission of high-ionisation resonance lines. Simple light travel time calculations based on the maximum phase of the narrow emission lines place the inner radius of the H-rich, un-shocked shell at a radius $\simeq4.4\times10^{15}\,\rm{cm}$, compatible with an absence of ejecta-CSM interaction during the first weeks of evolution. Possible signatures of interaction appear only $\sim69\,\rm{days}$ after explosion, although the resulting conversion of kinetic energy into radiation does not seem to contribute significantly to the total luminosity of the transient.</description>

      <title>A Neutron Capture Explanation for the 10 MeV Emission Line Seen in GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brightest ever gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A displays a significant emission line component around 10 MeV. As the GRB central engine is neutron-rich, we propose that the emission line could be originally due to the 2.223 MeV gamma-rays following neutron capture with protons. The measured line profile can be adequately fitted with a neutron capture model that involves thermal broadening and a bulk Doppler shift. The spectral modeling reveals a Doppler factor varying from 5.1 to 2.1 for the neutron-rich component, along with a temperature increase from 300 keV to about 900 keV, during the time interval of 280--360 s since the trigger, with about $10^{-2}$ $M_\odot$ deuteriums produced in the process. We argue that the neutron capture can take place in the outer shell of a structure jet. Disk winds could be another possible site.</description>

      <title>A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^-5 to 10^-2 Msun/yr, we confirmed that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^-2 Msun/yr located within 10^15 cm to the progenitor.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Optical Afterglows Without Gamma-ray Bursts: Identification of AT2023lcr and Multiwavelength Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past few years, the improved sensitivity and cadence of wide-field optical surveys have enabled the discovery of several afterglows without associated detected gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We present the identification, observations, and multiwavelength modeling of a recent such afterglow (AT2023lcr), and model three literature events (AT2020blt, AT2021any, and AT2021lfa) in a consistent fashion. For each event, we consider the following possibilities as to why a GRB was not observed: 1) the jet was off-axis; 2) the jet had a low initial Lorentz factor; and 3) the afterglow was the result of an on-axis classical GRB (on-axis jet with physical parameters typical of the GRB population), but the emission was undetected by gamma-ray satellites. We estimate all physical parameters using afterglowpy and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods from emcee. We find that AT2023lcr, AT2020blt, and AT2021any are consistent with on-axis classical GRBs, and AT2021lfa is consistent with both on-axis low Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \approx 5 - 13$) and off-axis ($\theta_\text{obs}=2\theta_\text{jet}$) high Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \approx 100$) jets.</description>

      <title>Modelling polarized X-ray pulses from accreting millisecond pulsars with X-PSI, using different hot spot locations and shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of polarized X-ray pulses based on simulated data for accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs). We used the open-source X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference code (previously applied to NICER observations), which we upgraded to allow polarization analysis. We provide estimates of how well neutron star (NS) parameters can be constrained for the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and find that strong limits on the hot region geometries can be hard to obtain if the emitting hot region is large and the number of polarized photons relatively small. However, if the star is bright enough and the hot regions are small and located so that polarization degree is higher, the observer inclination and hot spot colatitude can be constrained to a precision of within a few degrees. We also found that the shape of the hot region, whether a circle or a ring, cannot be distinguished in our most optimistic scenario. Nevertheless, future X-ray polarization missions are expected to improve the constraints, and already the recent AMP polarization detections by IXPE should help to infer the NS mass and radius when combined with modelling of X-ray pulse data sets that do not contain polarization information.</description>

      <title>Can Neutron Star Tidal Effects Obscure Deviations from General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main goals of gravitational-wave astrophysics is to study gravity in the strong-field regime and constrain deviations from general relativity (GR). Any such deviation affects not only binary dynamics and gravitational-wave emission but also the structure and tidal properties of compact objects. In the case of neutron stars, masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities can all differ significantly between different theories of gravity. Currently, the measurement uncertainties in neutron star radii and tidal deformabilities are quite large. However, much less is known about how the large uncertainty in the nuclear equation of state (EOS) might affect tests of GR using binary neutron star mergers. Conversely, using the wrong theory of gravity might lead to incorrect constraints on the nuclear EOS. Here, we study this problem within scalar-tensor (ST) theory. We apply the recently derived $\ell = 2$ tidal Love numbers in this theory to parameter estimation of GW170817. Correspondingly, we test if physics beyond GR could bias measurements of the nuclear EOS and neutron star radii. We find that parameter inference for both the GR and ST cases return consistent component masses and tidal deformabilities. The radius and the EOS posteriors, however, differ between the two theories, but neither is excluded by current observational limits. This indicates that measurements of the nuclear EOS may be biased and that deviations from GR could go undetected when analyzing current binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>A comparison between best-fit eccentricity definitions and the standardized definition of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of a unique, gauge-independent definition of eccentricity in General Relativity, there have been efforts to standardize the definition for Gravitational-Wave astronomy. Recently, Shaikh et al. proposed a model-independent measurement of eccentricity $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ from the phase evolution of the dominant mode. Many works use loss functions (LFs) to assign eccentricity to a reference waveform, for instance by fitting a Post-Newtonian expression to assign eccentricity to Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations. Therefore, we ask whether minimizing common LFs on gauge-dependent model parameters, such as the mismatch $\mathcal{M}$ or the $L_2$-norm of the dominant mode $h_{22}$ residuals, for non-precessing binaries, ensures a sufficient $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ agreement. We use $10$ eccentric NR simulations and the eccentric waveform TEOBResumS-Dali as the parametric model to fit on eccentricity $e_0$ and reference frequency $f_0$. We first show that a minimized mismatch, the $\mathcal{M} \sim 10^{-3}- 10^{-2}$ results in better $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ fractional differences ($\sim 1\%$) than with the minimized $h_{22}$ residuals. Nonetheless, for small eccentricity NR simulations $(e_{\mathrm{gw}} \lesssim 10^{-2}$), the mismatch can favor quasi-circular ($e_0=0$) best-fit models. Thus, with sufficiently long NR simulations, we can include $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ in the LF. We explain why solely fitting with $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ constitutes a degenerate problem. To circumvent these limitations, we propose to minimize a convex sum of $\mathcal{M}$ and the $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ difference to both assign non-zero eccentric values to NR strains and to control the mismatch threshold.</description>
