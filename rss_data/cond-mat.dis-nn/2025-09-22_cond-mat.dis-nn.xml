      <title>Universality Classes of delocalization-localization transitions in Chiral Symplectic Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a simulation study of three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) disordered lattice models in the chiral symplectic class, we show that one-dimensional (1D) weak topology universally induces an intermediate quasi-localized (QL) phase between metal and Anderson-localized phases, in which the localization length of wave functions is divergent only along the spatial direction associated with the weak topological index. Our numerical evaluation of the critical exponents of the metal-to-QL transition and the Anderson transition (in the absence of the weak topology) demonstrates that they belong to different universality classes. We also confirm that the critical exponents of these two transitions in the chiral symplectic class significantly differ from those in the chiral unitary and chiral orthogonal classes, highlighting the impact of Kramers time-reversal symmetry on quantum critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Strong Disorder Renormalization Group Method for Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions: Excited States and Finite Temperature Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains, to study excited states, and finite temperature properties. First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, which is defined by the model with power law interaction, keeping only interactions between adjacent spins. We show that the distribution of the absolute value of the couplings is the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. However, the sign of the couplings becomes distributed, and the number of negative couplings increases with temperature $T.$ Next, we derive the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins with power exponent $\alpha$. While the sign of the couplings is found to be distributed, the distribution of the coupling amplitude is given by the strong disorder distribution with finite width $2\alpha,$ with small corrections for $\alpha &gt;2$. Resulting finite temperature properties of both short and power law long ranged spin systems are derived, including the magnetic susceptibility, concurrence and entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact solution of the non-Hermitian disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an asymptotically exact solution of a paradigmatic non-Hermitian model: the disordered interacting fermionic Hatano-Nelson model, or equivalently, the non-Hermitian spin-1/2 XXZ model. We use a renormalization group method suited for disordered systems and show that non-Hermitian couplings are relevant perturbations to the Hermitian model, which ultimately leads to a quantum-to-classical crossover. The ground state of the model consists of a collection of strongly coupled pairs of spins of arbitrary size at random positions which, unlike the Hermitian case, do not form singlets, but a mixture of the singlet and the $M=0$ triplet state. As a result, the magnetic susceptibility in the $x,y$-directions becomes negative and diverges at a finite small temperature. Additionally, in sharp contrast to the $\ln(L)$ increase observed in disordered Hermitian chains, the entanglement entropy of a partition of size $L$ saturates for large $L$, as the strongly coupled pairs become classical and stop contributing at large length scales.</description>

      <title>A facilitation-induced fluidization transition in supercooled water triggered by a few active molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an activation mechanism reproducing facilitation, a dynamic phase transition triggered by a few active molecules was recently found in a supercooled model liquid. Prompted by this finding we investigate the presence of a similar transition in supercooled water. We find the presence of the phase transition in water despite the numerous anomalies of water, suggesting universality of the transition. The transition appears at constant temperature, being only induced by the motion of a small percentage of active molecules and the system cooperativity. We observe that cooperative motions strongly increase at the transition and do not disappear when the medium viscosity drops. An increase of temperature is needed to make the cooperative motions disappear, suggesting a connection to the kinetic energy to potential energy ratio instead of the medium viscosity.</description>

      <title>Accelerated characterization of two-level systems in superconducting qubits via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach for extracting two-level system (TLS) parameters-frequency $\omega_{TLS}$, coupling strength $g$, dissipation time $T_{TLS, 1}$, and the pure dephasing time $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$, labelled as a 4-component vector $\vec{q}$, directly from simulated spectroscopy data generated for a single TLS by a form of two-tone spectroscopy. Specifically, we demonstrate that a custom convolutional neural network model(CNN) can simultaneously predict $\omega_{TLS}$, $g$, $T_{TLS, 1}$ and $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$ from the spectroscopy data presented in the form of images. Our results show that the model achieves superior performance to perturbation theory methods in successfully extracting the TLS parameters. Although the model, initially trained on noise-free data, exhibits a decline in accuracy when evaluated on noisy images, retraining it on a noisy dataset leads to a substantial performance improvement, achieving results comparable to those obtained under noise-free conditions. Furthermore, the model exhibits higher predictive accuracy for parameters $\omega_{TLS}$ and $g$ in comparison to $T_{TLS, 1}$ and $T^{\phi}_{TLS, 2}$.</description>

      <title>When is nonreciprocity relevant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions are widely observed in nonequilibrium systems, from biological or sociological dynamics to open quantum systems. Despite the ubiquity of nonreciprocity, its impact on phase transitions is not fully understood. In this work, we derive criteria to perturbatively assess whether nonreciprocity changes the universality class of pairs of asymmetrically coupled systems undergoing a phase transition. These simple criteria are stated in terms of the unperturbed critical exponents, in the spirit of the Harris criterion for disordered systems, and agree with numerical simulations. Beyond nonreciprocity, our approach provides guidelines for assessing how dynamical phase transitions are affected by perturbations.</description>

      <title>Universal localization-delocalization transition in chiral-symmetric Floquet drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems often exhibit behavior distinct from static systems. In single-particle, static systems, any amount of disorder generically localizes all eigenstates in one dimension. In contrast, we show that in topologically nontrivial, single-particle Floquet loop drives with chiral symmetry in one dimension, a localization-delocalization transition occurs as the time $t$ is varied within the driving period ($0 \le t \le \td$). We find that the time-dependent localization length $\lloc(t)$ diverges with a universal exponent as $t$ approaches the midpoint of the drive: $\lloc(t) \sim (t - \td/2)^{-\nu}$ with $\nu=2$. We provide analytical and numerical evidence for the universality of this exponent within the AIII symmetry class.</description>

      <title>Free energy in spin glass models with conventional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, [DOI:10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1] considered spin glass models with additional conventional order parameters characterizing single-replica properties. These parameters are distinct from the standard order parameter, the overlap, used to measure correlations between replicas. A ``min-max'' formula for the free energy was prescribed in [DOI:10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1]. We rigorously verify this prescription in the setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin interactions. Notably, our results can be viewed as a generalization of the Parisi formula for vector spin glass models in [DOI:10.1214/17-AOP1194], where the order parameter for self-overlap is already present.</description>

      <title>A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Interrelation Between Elastic Moduli in Critically Elastic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critically elastic materials - those that are rigid with a single state of self-stress - can be generated from parent systems with two states of self-stress by the removal of one of many constraints. We show that the elastic moduli of the resulting homogeneous and isotropic daughter systems are interrelated by a universal functional form parametrized by properties of the parent. In simulations of both spring networks and packings of soft spheres, judicious choice of parent systems and bond removal allows for the selection of a wide variety of moduli and Poisson's ratios in the critically elastic systems, providing a framework for versatile deterministic selection of mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum chaos via pseudo-entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum informatic quantities such as entanglement entropy are useful in detecting quantum phase transitions. Recently, a new entanglement measure called pseudo-entropy was proposed which is a generalization of the more well-known entanglement entropy. It has many nice properties and is useful in the study of post-selection measurements. In this paper, one of our goals is to explore the properties of pseudo-entropy and study its effectiveness as a quantum chaos diagnostic, i.e., as a tool to distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. Using various variants of the SYK model, we study the signal of quantum chaos captured in the pseudo-entropy and relate it to the spectral form factor (SFF) and local operator entanglement (LOE).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful variational ans\"atze capable of representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQS such as recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.</description>
