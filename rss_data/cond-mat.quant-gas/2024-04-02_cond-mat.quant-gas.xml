      <title>Flattening a trapped atomic gas using a programmable optical potential in a feedback loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for producing a flat, large-area Fermi gas of $^6$Li with a uniform area density. The method uses a programmable optical potential within a feedback loop to flatten the in-plane trapping potential for atoms. The optical potential is generated using a laser beam, whose intensity profile is adjusted by a spatial light modulator and optimized through measurements of the density distribution of the sample. The resulting planar sample exhibits a uniform area density within a region of about 480 $\mu$m in diameter and the standard deviation of the trap bottom potential is estimated to be $\approx k_B \times$ 6.1 nK, which is less than 20$\%$ of the transverse confinement energy. We discuss a dimensional crossover toward 2D regime by reducing the number of atoms in the planar trap, including the effect of the spatial variation of the transverse trapping frequency in the large-area sample.</description>

      <title>Discrete Scale Invariance and $U(2)$ Family of Two-Body Contact Interactions in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the absence of indistinguishability constraint, interparticle interactions between nonidentical particles have in general much more variety than those between identical particles. In particular, it is known that there exists a $U(2)$ family of two-body contact interactions between nonidentical particles in one spatial dimension. This paper studies breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance under this $U(2)$ family of two-body contact interactions in two-body problems of nonidentical particles on the half line. We show that, in contrast to the corresponding identical-particle problem, there exist two distinct channels that admit geometric sequences of two-body bound states.</description>

      <title>Gauge potentials and vortices in the Fock space of a pair of periodically driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of the coupled dynamics of two species of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a double well potential where both the tunneling and the interatomic interactions are driven periodically in time. The population difference between the wells of each species gives rise to a two dimensional lattice in Fock space with dimensions given by the number of atoms in each BEC. We use a Floquet analysis to derive an effective Hamiltonian that acts in this Fock space and find that it contains an artificial gauge field. This system simulates noninteracting particles in a tight binding lattice subject to an additional harmonic potential and vector potential. When the intra-species interactions are attractive there is a critical value at which the ground state of the Floquet operator undergoes a transition from a Gaussian state to a quantized vortex state in Fock space. The transition can be quantified in terms of the angular momentum as well as the entanglement entropy of the ground state with both showing sudden jumps as the intra-species interactions become stronger. The stability of the vortex state vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations in a quasi-periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations and Landau-Zener tunneling are ubiquitous phenomena which are sustained by a band-gap spectrum of a periodic Hamiltonian and can be observed in dynamics of a quantum particle or a wavepacket in a periodic potential under action of a linear force. Such physical setting remains meaningful for aperiodic potentials too, although band-gap structure does not exist anymore. Here we consider the dynamics of noninteracting atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates in a quasi-periodic one-dimensional optical lattice subjected to a weak linear force. Excited states with energies below the mobility edge, and thus localized in space, are considered. We show that the observed oscillatory behavior is enabled by tunneling between the initial state and a state (or several states) located nearby in the coordinate-energy space. The states involved in such Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations are determined by the selection rule consisting of the condition of their spatial proximity and condition of quasi-resonances occurring at avoided crossings of the energy levels. The latter condition is formulated mathematically using the Gershgorin circle theorem. The effect of the inter-atomic interactions on the dynamics can also be predicted on the bases of the developed theory. The reported results can be observed in any physical system allowing for observation of the Bloch oscillations, upon introducing incommensurablity in the governing Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven breakdown of Aharonov--Bohm caging in flat-band Rydberg lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands play a central role in hosting emergent states of matter in many condensed matter systems, from the nascent insulating states of twisted bilayer graphene to the fractionalized excitations found in frustrated magnets and quantum Hall materials. Here, we report on the experimental realization of highly tunable flat-band models populated by strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. Using the approach of synthetic dimensions, we engineer a flat-band rhombic lattice with twisted boundaries, and through nonequilibrium dynamics we explore the control of Aharonov--Bohm (AB) caging via a tunable $U(1)$ gauge field. Through microscopic measurements of Rydberg pairs, we explore the interaction-driven breakdown of AB caging in the limit of strong dipolar interactions that mix the lattice bands. In the limit of weak interactions, where caging remains intact, we observe an effective magnetism that arises due to the interaction-driven mixing of degenerate flat-band states. These observations of strongly correlated flat-band dynamics open the door to explorations of new emergent phenomena in synthetic quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Parallel finite-element codes for the Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and distribute a parallel finite-element toolbox written in the free software FreeFem for computing the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) spectrum of stationary solutions to one- and two-component Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations, in two or three spatial dimensions. The parallelization of the toolbox relies exclusively upon the recent interfacing of FreeFem with the PETSc library. The latter contains itself a wide palette of state-of-the-art linear algebra libraries, graph partitioners, mesh generation and domain decomposition tools, as well as a suite of eigenvalue solvers that are embodied in the SLEPc library. Within the present toolbox, stationary states of the GP equations are computed by a Newton method. Branches of solutions are constructed using an adaptive step-size continuation algorithm. The combination of mesh adaptivity tools from FreeFem with the parallelization features from PETSc makes the toolbox efficient and reliable for the computation of stationary states. Their BdG spectrum is computed using the SLEPc eigenvalue solver. We perform extensive tests and validate our programs by comparing the toolbox's results with known theoretical and numerical findings that have been reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>The spectral continuum in the Rabi-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rabi-Stark model is a non-linear generalization of the quantum Rabi model including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of normalizable states are embedded in the continuum which furnishes an unexpected analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained analytically through two equally justified, but different confluence processes of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale numerical checks.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks and correlated dynamics in an interacting synthetic Rydberg lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent dynamics of interacting quantum particles plays a central role in the study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the pursuit of quantum information processors. Here, we present the state-space of interacting Rydberg atoms as a synthetic landscape on which to control and observe coherent and correlated dynamics. With full control of the coupling strengths and energy offsets between the pairs of sites in a nine-site synthetic lattice, we realize quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and dynamics in an Escher-type ``continuous staircase". In the interacting regime, we observe correlated quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and confinement of particle pairs. Additionally, we simultaneously tilt our lattice both up and down to achieve coherent pair oscillations. This work establishes synthetic Rydberg lattices of interacting atom arrays as a promising platform for programmable quantum many-body dynamics with access to features that are difficult to realize in real-space lattices.</description>

      <title>Topological phases and edge modes of an uneven ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of a two-chain quantum ladder with uneven legs, i.e. the two chains differ in their periods by a factor of two. Such an uneven ladder presents rich band structures classified by the closure of either direct or indirect bandgaps. It also provides opportunities to explore fundamental concepts concerning band topology and edge modes, including the difference of intracellular and intercellular Zak phases, and the role of the inversion symmetry (IS). We calculate the Zak phases of the two kinds and find excellent agreement with the dipole moment and extra charge accumulation, respectively. We also find that configurations with IS feature a pair of degenerate two-side edge modes emerging as the closure of the direct bandgap, while configurations without IS feature one-side edge modes emerging as not only the closure of both direct and indirect bandgap but also within the band continuum. Furthermore, by projecting to the two sublattices, we find that the effective Bloch Hamiltonian corresponds to that of a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model or Rice-Mele model whose hopping amplitudes depend on the quasimomentum. In this way, the topological phases can be efficiently extracted through winding numbers. We propose that uneven ladders can be realized by spin-dependent optical lattices and their rich topological characteristics can be examined by near future experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurement of three-body recombination coefficient of ultracold lithium and strontium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the observation of a conspicuous loss in an ultracold mixture of $^{7}$Li and $^{88}$Sr atoms confined in a far-off-resonance optical dipole trap. We attribute the trap loss to the three-body inelastic Li-Sr-Sr collision and extract the corresponding three-body recombination coefficient $K_3$ at $T\sim 18.5,45,70,600$ $\mu K$. The measured three-body recombination coefficient is about two to three orders of magnitude larger than the typical values convenient for realizing quantum degenerate gases. It also indicates a potentially large $s$-wave scattering length between the bosonic $^{7}$Li and $^{88}$Sr atoms, and essentially rules out the prospect of realizing $^7$Li and $^{88}$Sr mixtures of high phase space density.</description>

Abstract: By means of Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action approach we investigate a homogeneous dilute weakly interacting Bose gas at finite temperature in vicinity of critical region. A longstanding debate, the shift of critical temperature, is considered and obtained in the universal form $\Delta T_C/T_C^{(0)} = cn_0^{1/3}a_s$ with constants $c$ and $a$. The non-condensate fraction is contributed by quantum fluctuations as well as thermal exitations and can be expressed in sum of three terms. These terms correspond to the quantum fluctuations, thermal fluctuations and both. Indeed, the specific heat capacity and critical exponents are calculated and in excellent agreement with those in previous works and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Unified Light-Matter Floquet Theory and its Application to Quantum Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically-driven quantum systems can exhibit a plethora of intriguing non-equilibrium phenomena that can be analyzed using Floquet theory. Naturally, Floquet theory is employed to describe the dynamics of atoms interacting with intense laser fields. However, this semiclassical analysis can not account for quantum-optical phenomena that rely on the quantized nature of light. In this paper, we take a significant step to go beyond the semiclassical description of atom-photon coupled systems by unifying Floquet theory with quantum optics using the framework of full-counting statistics. This is achieved by introducing counting fields that keep track of the photonic dynamics. This formalism, which we dub ``photon-resolved Floquet theory" (PRFT), is based on two-point tomographic measurements, instead of the two-point projective measurements used in standard full-counting statistics. Strikingly, the PRFT predicts the generation of macroscopic light-matter entanglement when atoms interact with multimode electromagnetic fields, thereby leading to complete decoherence of the atomic subsystem in the basis of the Floquet states. This decoherence occurs rapidly in the optical frequency regime, but is negligible in the radio frequency regime. Our results thus pave the way for the design of efficient quantum memories and quantum operations. Finally, employing the PRFT, we propose a quantum communication protocol that can significantly outperform the state-of-art few-photon protocols by two orders of magnitude or better. The PRFT potentially leads to insights in various Floquet settings including spectroscopy, thermodynamics, quantum metrology, and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Exact asymptotics of long-range quantum correlations in a nonequilibrium steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium states of many-body systems tend to evade a description by standard statistical mechanics, and their uniqueness is epitomized by the possibility of certain long-range correlations that cannot occur in equilibrium. In quantum many-body systems, coherent correlations of this sort may lead to the emergence of remarkable entanglement structures. In this work, we analytically study the asymptotic scaling of quantum correlation measures -- the mutual information and the fermionic negativity -- within the zero-temperature steady state of voltage-biased free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice containing a noninteracting impurity. Previously, we have shown that two subsystems on opposite sides of the impurity exhibit volume-law entanglement, which is independent of the absolute distances of the subsystems from the impurity. Here we go beyond that result and derive the exact form of the subleading logarithmic corrections to the extensive terms of correlation measures, in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. In particular, the logarithmic term of the mutual information asymptotics can be encapsulated in a concise formula, depending only on simple four-point ratios of subsystem length-scales and on the impurity scattering probabilities at the Fermi energies. This echoes the case of equilibrium states, where such logarithmic terms may convey universal information about the physical system. To compute these exact results, we devise a hybrid method that relies on Toeplitz determinant asymptotics for correlation matrices in both real space and momentum space, successfully circumventing the inhomogeneity of the system. This method can potentially find wider use for analytical calculations of entanglement measures in similar scenarios.</description>
