      <title>HDN:Hybrid Deep-learning and Non-line-of-sight Reconstruction Framework for Photoacoustic Brain Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the deep penetration depth of ultrasonic imaging, showing great potential in cerebrovascular disease detection. However, the ultrasonic wave suffers strong attenuation and multi-scattering when it passes through the skull tissue, resulting in the distortion of the collected photoacoustic (PA) signal. In this paper, inspired by the principles of deep learning and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, we propose an image reconstruction framework named HDN (Hybrid Deep-learning and Non-line-of-sight), which consists of the signal extraction part and difference utilization part. The signal extraction part is used to correct the distorted signal and reconstruct an initial image. The difference utilization part is used to make further use of the signal difference between the distorted signal and corrected signal, reconstructing the residual image between the initial image and the target image. The test results on a PA digital brain simulation dataset show that compared with the traditional delay-and-sum (DAS) method and deep-learning-based method, HDN achieved superior performance in both signal correction and image reconstruction. Specifically for the SSIM index, the HDN reached 0.606 in imaging results, compared to 0.154 for the DAS method and 0.307 for the deep-learning-based method.</description>

      <title>Cold plasma with zirconia nanoparticles for lung cancer via TGF-\b{eta} signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements in lung cancer therapy, the prognosis for advanced or metastatic patients remains poor, yet many patients eventually develop resistance to standard treatments leading to disease progression and poor survival. Here, we described a combination of CAP and nanoparticles (ZrO2 NPs (zirconium oxide nanoparticle) and 3Y-TZP NPs (3% mol Yttria Tetragonal Zirconia Polycrystal Nanoparticle)) for lung cancer therapy. We found that ZrO2 NPs caused obvious damage to the inside of the lung cancer cells. CAP and ZrO2 NPs mainly affected the mitochondria function, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, and causing endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell nucleus internal DNA damage, etc. CAP combined with ZrO2 NPs (CAP@ZrO2) induced lung cancer cell apoptosis by activating the TGF-\b{eta} pathway. CAP@ZrO2 offers a new therapy for the clinical treatment of lung cancer.</description>

      <title>Laboratory x-ray nano-computed tomography for biomedical research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution x-ray tomography is a common technique for biomedical research using synchrotron sources. With advancements in laboratory x-ray sources, an increasing number of experiments can be performed in the lab. In this paper, the design, implementation, and verification of a laboratory setup for x-ray nano-computed tomography is presented using a nano-focus x-ray source and high geometric magnification not requiring any optical elements. Comparing a scintillator-based detector to a photon counting detector shows a clear benefit of using photon counting detectors for these applications, where the flux of the x-ray source is limited and samples have low contrast. Sample contrast is enhanced using propagation-based phase contrast. The resolution of the system is verified using 2D resolution charts and using Fourier Ring Correlation on reconstructed CT slices. Evaluating noise and contrast highlights the benefits of photon counting detectors and the contrast improvement through phase contrast. The implemented setup is capable of reaching sub-micron resolution and satisfying contrast in biological samples, like paraffin embedded tissue.</description>

      <title>Young double-slit interference with single hard x-ray photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young double-slit experiments using monochromatic hard X-rays with the energy of 25 keV are presented. The experiments were performed at a synchrotron source with a distance of 110 m between the interferometer and the detector to produce an interference pattern with a sufficiently broad period that could be adequately sampled by a photon-counting detector with 75 micrometre pixels. In the single-particle version of the experiment, over one million image frames with a single registered photon in each one were collected. The sum of these frames showed a clear presence of the interference pattern with the expected period. Subsequent analysis provided an objective estimation of the minimal number of detected photons required to determine, in accordance with the Rose criterion, the presence of the photon interference. Apart from a general theoretical interest, these investigations were aimed at exploring the possibility of medical X-ray phase-contrast imaging in photon-counting mode at minimal radiation doses.</description>
