      <title>Neutrinos from stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Trans-Alfv\'enic Region Using Observations from Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close to Earth the solar wind is usually super-Alfv\'enic, i.e. the speed of the solar wind is much larger than the Alfv\'en speed. However, in the lower coronal regions, the solar wind is mostly sub-Alfv\'enic. With the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) crossing the boundary between the sub- and super-Alfv\'enic flow, Bandyopadhyay et al. (2022) performed a turbulence characterization of the sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind with initial data from encounters 8 and 9. In this study, we re-examine the turbulence properties such as turbulence amplitude, anisotropy of the magnetic field variance, intermittency and switchback strength extending with PSP data for encounters 8-19. The later orbits probe lower altitudes and experience sub-Alfv\'enic conditions more frequently providing a greater statistical coverage to contrast sub- and super-Alfv\'enic solar wind. Also, by isolating the intervals where the solar wind speed is approximately equal to the Alfv\'en speed, we explore the transition in more detail. We show that the amplitude of the normalized magnetic field fluctuation is smaller for the sub-Alfv\'enic samples. While solar wind turbulence in general is shown to be anisotropic, the sub-Alfv\'enic samples are more anisotropic than the super-Alfv\'enic samples, in general. Further, we show that the sub- and super-Alfv\'enic samples do not show much distinction in terms of intermittency strength. Finally, consistent with prior results, we find no evidence for polarity reversing &gt; 90 degrees switchbacks in the sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind</description>

      <title>Good things always come in 3s: trimodality in the binary black-hole chirp-mass distribution supports bimodal black-hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest GWTC-4 release from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration nearly doubles the known population of double compact object mergers and reveals a new trimodal structure in the chirp-mass distribution of merging binary black holes (BBHs) below 30 Msun. Recent detailed stellar evolution models show that features in the pre-collapse cores of massive stars produce a bimodal black hole (BH) mass distribution, which naturally extends to a trimodal BBH chirp-mass distribution. Both distributions depend only weakly on metallicity, implying universal structural features which can be tested with LVK observations. Using a new compact-remnant mass prescription derived from these models, we perform rapid population synthesis simulations to test the robustness of the predicted chirp-mass structure against uncertainties in binary evolution and cosmic star formation history, and compare these results with the current observational data. The trimodal chirp-mass distribution emerges as a robust outcome of the new remnant-mass model, persisting across variations in binary and cosmic physics. In contrast, traditional BH formation models lacking a bimodal BH mass spectrum fail to reproduce the observed trimodality. The updated models also predict lower BBH merger rates by a factor of a few, in closer agreement with LVK constraints. Intriguingly, the central chirp-mass peak, dominated by unequal-mass BBHs, originates from a previously underappreciated formation pathway in which strong luminous blue variable winds suppress binary interaction before the first BH forms. If isolated binary evolution dominates BBH formation below 30 Msun, the relative heights of the three chirp-mass peaks offer powerful observational constraints on core collapse, BH formation, binary evolution, and cosmic star formation. These universal structural features may also serve as standard sirens for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Classification for 969 double-mode RR Lyrae stars from Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae (RRL) variable stars are cornerstone distance indicators. In particular, double-mode RR Lyrae (RRd) stars enable period--luminosity relations (PLRs) that are less sensitive to metallicity, reducing systematic biases in distance measurements. However, their utility has been limited by a global sample of only $\sim$3,000 objects. We develop an automated RRd-screening pipeline and apply it to a cross-matched sample between the Gaia DR3 RRL catalog and ZTF DR22 time-series photometry. The workflow combines Lomb--Scargle period searches, iterative pre-whitening, period-ratio constraints that suppress $\sim$1-day sampling aliases, and amplitude-based quality cuts, enabling large-scale RRd star screening. We produce two ZTF-based catalogs: (i) 39,322 reliable single-mode RRL (40.5\% of the cross-matched set) and (ii) 969 RRd stars. Among the RRd stars, 614 objects are newly identified, substantially enlarging this previously scarce sample; the catalog achieves an estimated completeness of 47.7\%. The PLR derived from the newly discovered RRd stars agrees with the LMC-based relation, though with larger uncertainties. Incorporating these stars will help tighten the RRd PLR and improve distance measurements. Looking ahead, systematic RRd searches with upcoming surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) should further extend high-accuracy distances across the Local Group and strengthen their cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>A New Algol-type Binary with an Accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Algol-type binary \textit{Gaia} DR3 1892576067672499328. We identified the system as a spectroscopic binary based on medium-resolution LAMOST spectra. Combined with \textit{TESS} photometry, we determine an orbital period of \( P = 2.47757 (1) \) days, a low mass ratio of \( q = 0.098 \pm 0.002 \), and an orbital inclination of \( i = 46.934^{+2.613}_{-1.11} \) degrees. The orbit is consistent with being circular (\( e = 0 \)). The binary comprises a \( M_1 = 1.817 ^{ +0.106}_{-0.202} \,M_\odot \), \( R_1 = 1.265^{+0.121}_{-0.160}\,R_\odot \) A-type primary and a Roche-lobe-filling secondary of \( M_2 = 0.179 ^{ +0.011}_{-0.020} \,M_\odot \), \( R_2 = 1.994 ^{ +0.041}_{-0.077} \,R_\odot \). The double-peak H$\alpha$ emission line indicates the possible existence of a Keplerian accretion disc. We established a simple standard accretion disc model and modeled the geometric and dynamical properties of the accretion disc. The obtained outer disc radius $R_{\mathrm{out}} \approx 3.36 \pm 0.43\,R_\odot$ is consistent with the values inferred from the emission velocity of H$\alpha$. Systemic velocity variations observed over time suggest the possible presence of a tertiary companion, with a minimum mass of $M_3 &gt; 0.369 \pm 0.024 \,M_\odot$. Given the low mass ratio, the secondary may evolve into a proto-helium white dwarf, forming an \text{EL CVn}-type system in the future. This system offers valuable insights into accretion dynamics and the formation of binaries.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of 29 March 2006 Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 29 March 2006, a total solar eclipse was observed in the Manavgat district of Antalya, Turkey. During the event, the solar corona was observed using an 8-inch mirrored telescope. White-light polarization observations were carried out at three distinct angles using a polarizing filter placed in front of the camera system. To calibrate the intensity of the roll film, photographs of the eclipse and the solar disk were taken with a traditional 35mm manual camera. Using the solar disk images obtained during the eclipse, an intensity calibration curve for the roll film was created. This curve was then used to calculate various physical properties of the solar corona, including intensity, degree of polarization, electron density, and mean temperature. The results of these calculations were compared with the corona models developed by \cite{VDH1950} and \cite{SK1970}, as well as with findings from other researchers. Except for the degree of polarization, the measured physical parameters closely match the values given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Probing sulfur chemistry in oxygen-rich AGB stars with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur and its isotopic ratios play a crucial role in understanding astrophysical environments, providing insights into nucleosynthesis, ISM processes, star formation, planetary evolution, and galactic chemistry. We investigate the distribution of sulfur bearing species $\rm{SO_2}$, $\rm{^{34}SO_2}$, SO, and $\rm{^{34}SO}$ towards five oxygen rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars ($o$ Ceti, R Dor, W Hya, R Leo, and EP Aqr), along with their excitation temperatures, column densities, and isotopic ratios. Using ALMA Band 6,7,8 data and CASSIS, we detect these species and estimate excitation temperature and column density via the rotational diagram and MCMC methods under LTE. Line imaging of various transitions is used to infer spatial distributions. The excitation temperatures of $\rm{SO_2}$ range from $\sim$200-600 K with column densities of $\rm{1-7\times10^{16}\ cm^{-2}}$, while $\rm{^{34}SO_2}$ shows comparable or slightly lower values and about an order of magnitude lower column densities. The $\rm{^{32}S/^{34}S}$ ratios for R Dor and W Hya are near solar, slightly higher for $o$ Ceti, and lower for EP Aqr and R Leo. Most detected lines exhibit centralized emission: high excitation $\rm{SO_2}$ traces compact hot gas in inner CSEs, whereas low-excitation lines trace more extended structures. Morphological differences, irregular emission in $o$ Ceti, circular in R Leo and W Hya, clumpy in R Dor, and unresolved in EP Aqr may arise from variations in physical conditions, multiplicity, outflows, rotation, desorption processes, UV or cosmic ray effects, or observational resolution. Overall, the centralized SO and $\rm{SO_2}$ emissions support previous findings for low mass-loss rate AGB stars, and the $\rm{^{32}S/^{34}S}$ ratios likely reflect natal cloud composition, with deviations linked to metallicity or excitation conditions.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Influence of Radiative Feedback in Bright-Rimmed Cloud 44</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative feedback from massive stars plays a central role in the evolution of molecular clouds and the interstellar medium. This paper presents a multi-wavelength analysis of the bright-rimmed cloud, BRC 44, which is located at the periphery of the Hii region Sh2-145 and is excited by the massive stars in the region. We use a combination of archival and newly obtained infrared data, along with new optical observations, to provide a census of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region and to estimate stellar parameters such as age, mass etc. The spatial distribution of YSOs visible in the optical wavelength suggests that they are distributed in separate clumps compared to the embedded YSOs and are relatively older. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of four YSOs in this region using the TANSPEC mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) confirms their youth. From Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting, most of the embedded YSO candidates are in their early stage of evolution, with the majority of them in their Class II and some in Class I stage. The relative proper motions of the YSOs with respect to the ionizing source are indicative of the rocket effect in the BRC. The 12CO, 13CO, and C18O observations with the Purple Mountain Observatory are used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the region. A comparison of the cold molecular gas distribution with simple analytical model calculations shows that the cloud is in the compression stage, and massive stars may be influencing the formation of young embedded stars in the BRC region due to radiative feedback.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of the magnetic cataclysmic binary EF Eridani: Revealing complex magnetic accretion during a high state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of the polar EF Eri, obtained with SALT and the SAAO 1.9-m telescope during its recent emergence from a three-decade-long low state. The average spectrum shows strong emission from the Balmer lines (H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$) and He~\textsc{ii} 4686 \AA{}, along with weaker emission from the He~\textsc{i} lines and the Bowen fluorescence (C~\textsc{iii}/N~\textsc{iii}) blend at 4650 \AA{}. The emission lines redward of 5500 \AA{} transition to pure absorption at orbital phases $\sim$0.75--0.95, which we attribute to obscuration of the line-emitting region by the accretion stream. Trailed spectra of the emission lines reveal multicomponent structures consistent with other polars. In this first Doppler study of EF Eri, tomograms of the strongest lines (He~\textsc{ii} 4686 \AA{} and the Balmer lines), using both the standard and inside-out projections, identify three key emission regions: the irradiated face of the secondary star, the ballistic and threading regions of the accretion stream, and the magnetically confined flow. Our Doppler maps show not only the ballistic stream but also two unambiguous magnetic accretion flows, which is consistent with the presence of multiple magnetic accretion regions.</description>

      <title>Gaia DR3 Open Cluster Cepheids: A Unified Catalog with Calibrated Period-Age and Period-Wesenheit Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (CCs) in Galactic open clusters (OCs) provide essential observational constraints for calibrating the period-age relation (PAR) and the period-Wesenheit relation (PWR) of CCs. However, distant and long-period OC Cepheids remain limited, while the confirmed samples still require more precise determinations of their physical properties, such as ages and extinctions. In this work, we present a comprehensive census of OC Cepheids based on an extensive sample of distant OCs from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). By combining astrometric and photometric membership analyses, we identified 110 CCs associated with 102 OCs, of which 41 CCs across 37 OCs were classified as OC Cepheids, while the remaining cases were considered candidate or rejected associations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, while 4 of the 41 OC Cepheids are newly reported here. Using updated cluster parameters derived from manual isochrone fitting, we primarily refined the PAR to log Age = (-0.595 $\pm$ 0.044) log P + (8.430 $\pm$ 0.042) and recalibrated the PWR to WG = (-3.615 $\pm$ 0.083) log P + (-2.379 $\pm$ 0.096). This study expands the sample of confirmed and candidate OC Cepheids. The newly longest-period confirmed OC Cepheid is BM Per (CWNU 3123) with log P = 1.36, and two newly discovered OC Cepheid candidates have distances exceeding 6 kpc. Moreover, the PAR and PWR are improved by incorporating refined OC ages and updated parallaxes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Starspot temperature of CoRoT-2 from multiwavelength observations with SPARC4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring starspot temperatures is crucial for understanding stellar magnetic activity, as it affects stellar brightness variations, influences exoplanet transit measurements, and provides constraints on the physical conditions and energy transport in active regions, offering insights into stellar dynamos. Our goal is to determine the temperature of starspots on the active star CoRoT-2 to enhance our understanding of magnetic activity in young, solar-like stars. Multiwavelength observations were conducted using the SPARC4 instrument on the 1.6-m telescope at Pico dos Dias Observatory (Brazil), capturing simultaneous transit data in four photometric bands (g, r, i, and z). The ECLIPSE model, combined with MCMC fitting, was used to model spot characteristics during the planetary transit of CoRoT-2 b. The spot intensities were analyzed considering three different methods: the assumption of blackbody emission, the PHOENIX atmospheric model, and multiwavelength fitting assuming the same spot parameters for all wavelengths. Two starspots were detected in the residuals of the light curve, yielding temperature estimates of 5040 - 5280 K based on the three different methods. These values align more closely with the temperatures of solar penumbrae than with typical umbral temperatures, suggesting relatively moderate magnetic activity. The radius of the spots ranged from 0.34 - 0.61 the planetary radius, or equivalently (38 - 69)$\times10^6$m, much larger than sunspots. This study provides a method to estimate spot temperatures on active stars using multiband photometry, with results indicating penumbral-like temperatures on CoRoT-2. The methodology enhances precision in starspot temperature estimation, beneficial for studies of stellar activity and exoplanet characterization.</description>

      <title>The assembly of intermediate black holes with complementary approaches: Dragon II and BPop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) occupy the $ 10^2 - 10^5\,M_\odot $ range, but their existence remains poorly constrained. Only a few candidates have been suggested in dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and LIGO-Virgo-Kagra detections. To investigate their formation and demographics, we adopt two complementary approaches. We first analyze the \textsc{dragonii} direct $N$-body simulations, which follow clusters with up to $ 10^6 $ stars, capture IMBHs growth. We then employ the semi-analytic code \textsc{bpop}, calibrated on \textsc{dragonii}, to explore a broad range of cluster and cosmological conditions.
  Our models reproduce merger rates consistent with GWTC-3, with $\sim30 - 60\%$ of BBHs forming dynamically, mainly in globular and nuclear clusters. About 2-3\% of mergers involve an IMBH, producing intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The IMBH mass distribution spans $2.5 \times 10^2 - 4 \times 10^4\,M_\odot $, with rare growth beyond $10^6\,M_\odot$. Formation efficiency rises with initial binary fraction but declines in metal-rich environments. IMBHs thus emerge as a distinct population bridging stellar and supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Composition of planetary debris around the white dwarf GD 362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf stars with high abundances of heavy elements in their atmospheres and infrared excesses are believed to be accreting planetary material. GD 362 is one of the most heavily polluted white dwarfs and has an exceptionally strong mid-infrared excess, reprocessing 2.4% of the star's light into the mid-infrared. We present a high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectrum of GD 362 obtained with JWST, covering 0.6 to 17 microns, along with photometry out to 25.5 microns. The mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by an exceptionally strong 9 to 11 micron silicate feature, which can be explained by a combination of olivine and pyroxene silicate minerals. Grains such as carbon, hotter than silicates, are required to explain the near-infrared emission. The silicates and carbon reside in a disk from 140 to 1400 stellar radii, and the disk scale height is greater than half the stellar radius. The elemental abundances of the solid material, relative to Si, are within a factor of 2 of meteoritic (CI chondrites) for C, O, Mg, Al, and Fe, with Al elevated and O slightly depleted. A similar pattern is observed for the abundances of accreted material in the stellar photosphere. Hydrogen is an exception, because no significant H-bearing minerals or water were detected in the disk, despite a large H abundance in the photosphere.</description>

      <title>Object Classification from JWST Catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST's exquisite data have opened the doors to new possibilities in detecting broad classes of astronomical objects, but also to new challenges in classifying those objects. In this work, we introduce SESHAT, the Stellar Evolutionary Stage Heuristic Assessment Tool for the identification of Young Stellar Objects, field stars (main sequence through asymptotic giant branch), brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, and galaxies, from any JWST observation. This identification is done using the machine learning method XGBoost to analyze thousands of rows of synthetic photometry, modified at run-time to match the filters available in the data to be classified. We validate this tool on real data of both star-forming regions and cosmological fields, and find we are able to reproduce the observed classes of objects to a minimum of 80\% recall across every class, without additional information on the ellipticity or spatial distribution of the objects. Furthermore, this tool can be used to test the filter choices for JWST proposals, to verify whether the chosen filters are sufficient to identify the desired class of objects. SESHAT is released as a Python package to the community for general use.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated X-ray Pulse Profile Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius $R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX 4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator. Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the Mass Distribution of Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors are observing an increasing number of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing a bimodal mass distribution of BBHs, which hints at diverse formation histories for these systems. Using the rapid binary population synthesis code MOBSE, we simulate a series of population synthesis models that include chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By considering metallicity-specific star formation and selection effects, we compare the intrinsic merger rates and detection rates of each model with observations. We find that the observed peaks in the mass distribution of merging BBHs at the low-mass end (10\msun) and the high-mass end (35\msun) are contributed by the common envelope channel or stable mass transfer channel (depending on the stability criteria for mass transfer) and the CHE channel, respectively, in our model. The merger rates and detection rates predicted by our model exhibit significant sensitivity to the choice of physical parameters. Different models predict merger rates ranging from 15.4 to $96.7\,\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ at redshift $z$ = 0.2, and detection rates ranging from 22.2 to 148.3$\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ under the assumption of a detectable redshift range of $z \le$ 1.0.</description>

      <title>SOAPv4: A new step toward modeling stellar signatures in exoplanet research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and describe a new version of the spot oscillation and planet code, SOAPv4. Our aim is to demonstrate its capabilities in modeling stellar activity in the context of RV measurements and its effects on transmission spectra. To do this, we employed solar observations alongside synthetic spectra and compared the resulting simulations. We used SOAPv4 to simulate photospheric active regions and planetary transits for a Sun-like star hosting a hot Jupiter. By varying the input spectra, we investigated their impact on the resulting absorption spectra and compared the corresponding simulations. We then assessed how stellar activity deforms these absorption profiles. Finally, we explored the chromatic signatures of stellar activity across different wavelength ranges and discussed how such effects have been employed in the literature to confirm planet detections in radial-velocity measurements. We present the latest updates to SOAP, a tool developed to simulate active regions on the stellar disk while accounting for wavelength-dependent contrast. This functionality enables a detailed study of chromatic effects on radial-velocity measurements. In addition, SOAPv4 models planet-occulted line distortions and quantifies the influence of active regions on absorption spectra. Our simulations indicate that granulation can introduce line distortions that mimic planetary absorption features, potentially leading to misinterpretations of atmospheric dynamics. Furthermore, comparisons with ESPRESSO observations suggest that models incorporating non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects provide an improved match to the absorption spectra of HD 209458 b, although they do not fully reproduce all observed distortions.</description>

      <title>AT 2018cow at ~5 years: additional evidence for a tidal disruption origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations. Despite a rich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and origin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the explosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely from an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by interacting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission and interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even later times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Spectra of $R$-Process Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radioactive decay of unstable nuclei created in the rapid neutron capture process release a large amount of $\gamma$-rays. When the ejecta is optically thick, these $\gamma$-rays may contribute to an associated kilonova. Once transparent, prominent spectral features will be directly observable in current and future $\gamma$-ray detectors. In this work, we study and compare the $\gamma$-ray spectra of a limited, weak, strong, and extended $r$-process across a broad timescale, identifying the nuclei which significantly contribute. We discuss these findings in the context of observability, noting that there are several practical challenges to connecting observed signatures to specific nuclei. However, if these challenges can be overcome, direct observation of $\gamma$-rays from $r$-process sites can provide insight into the fundamental physics underpinning the $r$-process.</description>

Abstract: Most M dwarfs show higher chromospheric activity, often exceeding solar levels. Characterizing stellar activity is essential, particularly since these stars are prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets. We investigate the stellar activity of active M dwarfs using TESS photometry combined with spectroscopic observations. We explore relations between flare occurrence rate (FOR), flare energies, rotation period, starspot filling factor, and chromospheric indicators. We also examine correlations between flare amplitude, duration, and cumulative flare frequency distributions to probe the mechanisms behind magnetic activity. We find that FOR is flat across spectral types M0-M4 but declines for cooler M dwarfs. Rapid rotators ($P_{\rm rot} &lt; 1$ day) display significantly higher FOR and flare activity. M dwarfs with higher FOR tend to have lower flare amplitudes, suggesting that frequent flares are generally less energetic. For stars with 0.15--0.76 $M_\odot$, the median $L_{H\alpha}/L_{\rm bol}$ varies by a factor of 2.5 across mass bins of 0.1 $M_\odot$, while $\Delta$EW decreases by 92\%. The cumulative flare frequency distributions show a decrease in the power-law slope from M0 to M5, with $\alpha$ ranging from 1.68 to 1.95. Our results indicate a transition in stellar activity near M4, where stronger H$\alpha$ emission coincides with higher FOR. We confirm that chromospheric and flare activity follow a power-law relation, highlighting the interplay between magnetic fields and flaring in M dwarfs. We also find that fast rotators sustain frequent flaring through strong dynamos, and that highly active stars dissipate magnetic energy via numerous low-energy flares rather than rare high-energy ones.</description>

Abstract: We announce V. 2025-08-08 of the Chroma+ suite of stellar atmosphere and spectrum modelling codes for fast, approximate, effectively platform-independent stellar spectrum synthesis, written in a number of free well-supported programming languages. The Chroma+ suite now computes the emergent surface intensity and flux distributions and the hydrostatic pressure structure assuming a spherical atmosphere rather than local flatness by implementing the analytic formal solution of the 1D spherical radiative transfer equation of Chapman (1966} based on an integration factor. We present our adaptation and discretization of the solution and demonstrate the resulting impact of our sphericity treatment on a number of computed observables, including exo-planet transit light-curves. All codes are available from the OpenStars www site: www.ap.smu.ca/OpenStars.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to investigating axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) by studying their potential conversion into X-rays within the Sun's atmospheric magnetic field. Utilizing high-sensitivity data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) collected during the 2020 solar minimum, along with advanced solar atmospheric magnetic field models, we establish a new limit on the axion-photon coupling strength $g_{a\gamma}\lesssim 7.3\times 10^{-12}$~GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% CL for axion masses $m_a\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$\,eV. This constraint surpasses current ground-based experimental limits, studying previously unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to masses of $m_a\lesssim 3.4\times 10^{-4}$\,eV. These findings mark a significant advancement in our ability to probe axion properties and strengthen indirect searches for dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal O(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to the critical impact parameter obtained in hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution ${\rm d} M/{\rm d}E$ and fallback rate ${\rm d} M/{\rm d} T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>
