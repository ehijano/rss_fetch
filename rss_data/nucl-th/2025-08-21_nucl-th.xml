      <title>Structure of the doubly magic nuclei $^{208}$Pb and $^{266}$Pb from ab initio computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14217v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical studies indicate that the superheavy neutron-rich nucleus $^{266}_{\ 82}$Pb$_{184}$ is doubly magic and at the neutron drip line. While its density distributions and single-particle energies have been computed, the structure of this nucleus is yet unknown. We perform ab initio computations of $^{266}$Pb using an interaction from an effective field theory of quantum chromodynamics tuned only on properties of nuclei with $A \leq 4$. We validate our theoretical framework by computing the first $2^+$ and $3^-$ excited states of $^{208}$Pb, finding agreement with experimental data. We confirm that $^{266}$Pb is doubly magic and show that its $3^-$ state, located below the $2^+$ state, exhibits an excitation gap of 2.6 MeV with respect to the ground state. Our calculations also suggest that this nucleus is at the neutron drip line.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of the IAR along the chains $ \boldsymbol{N=50} $ and $ \boldsymbol{Z=50} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Isobaric Analog Resonances in even-even nuclei along the $ N=50 $ isotonic chain. First, Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations, using the Gogny D1M effective interaction, have been performed to provide energies and occupation probabilities of nucleon orbitals. The Isobaric Analog Resonances are calculated with the charge exchange QRPA approach on top of then HFB calculations. Fermi transition mechanism is interpreted with the existence of collective modes in the final nucleus. The fragmentation of the Fermi Strength results from the fractional occupation of nucleon shells, a direct consequence of nuclear pairing. The theoretical Fermi transition probabilities along the isotopic chain $ Z=50 $ are also analyzed and confirm our conclusions.</description>

      <title>The role of the pion mass on the QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the role of the pion mass on the QCD phase diagram in the $T-eB$ plane using an effective model treatment. Such treatments are able to capture the main features predicted by first-principles calculations. We also employed the model to estimate the pion mass beyond which the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect disappears. The value is found to be independent of the strength of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Renormalized Yukawa Hamiltonian: Spectrum, Parton Distribution Functons, and Resource Estimates for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Renormalization Group Procedure for Effective Particles (RGPEP) to the front form Yukawa Hamiltonian, yielding a renormalized (effective) Hamiltonian, accurate up to second order in the coupling strength. Subsequently, we examine the spectrum and parton distribution functions produced by the renormalized Hamiltonian, and show that the addition of counterterms leads to finite results. Resource estimates for quantum simulation are calculated for a single `Ladder Operator Block Encoding' (LOBE), and show that the cost to block encode the renormalized Hamiltonian is comparable to block encoding the bare Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Deuteron-Deuteron Interaction and Correlation Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between deuterons ($d$-$d$) is pivotal for understanding the characteristics of certain light nuclei from the perspective of the deuteron cluster and achieving a precise reproduction of $d$-$d$ fusion cross sections. In this work, we construct a new set of elastic $d$-$d$ interactions by fitting the phase shifts using potentials parameterized in a Woods-Saxon shape. Then, the correlation functions are calculated with the obtained potential and compared with the recent measurements by the STAR collaboration. We find that the $d$-$d$ phase shifts and the correlation functions are internally consistent, confirming that correlation functions can provide cross-check for the $d$-$d$ interaction. In addition, both the $^1S_0$ bound state and the repulsive $^5S_2$ interaction contribute to the observed suppression in the measured correlation function. Moreover, we demonstrate that the $P$-wave contribution of the correlation functions cannot be neglected, especially in determining the source size.</description>

      <title>Perspectives for hyperon and hypernuclei physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypernuclei, nuclei containing one or more hyperons, serve as unique laboratories for probing the non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Recent progress in hypernuclear physics, driven by advanced experimental techniques and theoretical innovations, is briefly reviewed with a focus on key findings and unresolved challenges, such as the precise determination of the hypertriton binding energy, investigations of charge symmetry breaking in mirror hypernuclei, and the search for exotic systems, including the neutral nn$\Lambda$ state. Experimental breakthroughs, including invariant-mass analyses and femtoscopy studies in heavy-ion collisions, as well as high-resolution $\gamma$-spectroscopy, have enabled precise studies of light hypernuclei and offered critical insights into the hyperon-nucleon interaction. Theoretical progress, including ab initio calculations based on chiral effective field theory and lattice QCD, has further enhanced our understanding of hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dynamics of nuclear collisions with elongated structure of $^{20}$Ne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results obtained from the study of $^{20}$Ne$-$$^{20}$Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 6.8 TeV using the Monte Carlo Pythia8/Angantyr model. Angantyr models heavy-ion collisions as a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions, without incorporating collective effects. We construct a bi-pyramidal structure of $^{20}$Ne nucleus composed of five $\alpha$-clusters and compare its collision dynamics against those generated using Woods-Saxon nuclear density distribution. The results are further compared for different orientations of the $^{20}$Ne nuclei, including tip-tip, body-body, body-tip, and random orientations of the bi-pyramidal structure. The results show that the geometric arrangement of $\alpha$-clusters in the $^{20}$Ne nucleus significantly influences the particle production patterns in final state particle multiplicity and mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_T \rangle$). These results highlight the sensitivity of final state observables to the nuclear structure and orientation of colliding nuclei, providing insights into the dynamics of small collision systems, even in non-hydrodynamic framework.</description>

      <title>The Quark Structure of the Nucleon and Moat Regimes in Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a model of nuclear structure that takes into account the quark substructure of the baryons to understand the behavior of static two-point correlation functions of meson fields in dense nuclear matter. We show that these correlation functions display ``moat'' regimes, where the inverse static correlation function is nonmonotonic in momentum space. This can have interesting consequences for the nature of nuclear matter, and it strengthens the possibility of a liquid-crystal phase for high densities.</description>

      <title>Equation of State of Decompressed Quark Matter, and Observational Signatures of Quark-Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark stars are challenging to confirm or exclude observationally because they can have similar masses and radii as neutron stars. By performing the first calculation of the non-equilibrium equation of state of decompressed quark matter at finite temperature, we determine the properties of the ejecta from binary quark-star or quark star-black hole mergers. We account for all relevant physical processes during the ejecta evolution, including quark nugget evaporation and cooling, and weak interactions. We find that these merger ejecta can differ significantly from those in neutron star mergers, depending on the binding energy of quark matter. For relatively high binding energies, quark star mergers are unlikely to produce r-process elements and kilonova signals. We propose that future observations of binary mergers and kilonovae could impose stringent constraints on the binding energy of quark matter and the existence of quark stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance. We investigate the modification of neutron star properties and confront them with the observations in the context of strongly-interacting dark matter scenario, specifically for a QCD-like theory with G$_2$ gauge group for which a first-principles equation-of-state from lattice calculations is available. We study the impact of various observational constraints and modeling of the QCD equation of state on the combined neutron stars. The results indicate that dark matter masses of a few hundred MeV to a few GeV are consistent with the latest observed neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. Renormalization group equations in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) EFT describe wee parton correlations and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in the CGC EFT has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable between gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this semi-classical double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections and wavefunction renormalization for atoms, nuclei, and other heavy composite particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-loop QED corrections to operator matrix elements involving heavy composite particles (e.g., heavy-mesons, nuclei, and atoms). We define a new notion of reducible and irreducible graphs which is useful for systems with many discrete excited states. The equivalence of the LSZ reduction formula and old fashioned perturbation theory is explicitly demonstrated. The self energy and vertex corrections are defined (to all orders), and the one-loop corrections are reduced to operator matrix elements which may be evaluated by hadronic, nuclear, or atomic theorists. The gauge dependence of the various pieces are studied in detail, and cancellation of spurious contributions are demonstrated in a class of covariant gauges; Coulomb gauge is also discussed. The formalism is applied to superallowed beta decay where we identify a number of effects that arise at one loop that are, to the best of our knowledge, not included in current extractions of $|V_{ud}|$. In particular we find an electromagnetic isospin breaking correction at $O(\alpha)$ in addition to the well known $O(Z^2\alpha^2)$ corrections from the intranuclear Coulomb field.</description>
