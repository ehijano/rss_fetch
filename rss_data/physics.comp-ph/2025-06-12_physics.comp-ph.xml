      <title>Phase-Space Engineering and Dynamical Long-Range Order in Memcomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Memcomputing machines (DMMs) are dynamical systems with memory (time non-locality) that have been designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Their corresponding ordinary differential equations depend on a few hyper-parameters that define both the system's relevant time scales and its phase-space geometry. Using numerical simulations on a prototypical DMM, we analyze the role of these physical parameters in engineering the phase space to either help or hinder the solution search by DMMs. We find that the DMM explores its phase space efficiently for a wide range of parameters, aided by the long-range correlations in their fast degrees of freedom that emerge dynamically due to coupling with the (slow) memory degrees of freedom. In this regime, the time it takes for the system to find a solution scales well as the number of variables increases. When these hyper-parameters are chosen poorly, the system navigates its phase space far less efficiently. However, we find that, in many cases, dynamical long-range order (DLRO) persists even when the phase-space exploration process is inefficient. DLRO only disappears if the memories are made to evolve as quickly as the fast degrees of freedom. This study points to the important role of memory and hyper-parameters in engineering the DMMs' phase space for optimal computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the mystery of enhanced open-circuit voltages in nanotextured perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies that rival those of established silicon photovoltaic technologies. Nanotextures in perovskite solar cells optimise light trapping and scattering, thereby improving optical absorption. In addition, nanotextures have been experimentally shown to enhance electronic performance, in particular, by increasing the open-circuit voltage $V_{\text{OC}}$ -- a phenomenon that, until now, has remained not fully understood. This study investigates the underlying reasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations for a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our results reveal that the increased open-circuit voltage is not driven by optical effects but by the textured geometry itself. For voltages near $V_{\text{OC}}$, texturing one of the absorber/transport layer interfaces increases the imbalance between electron and hole densities in the absorber, thereby reducing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, which is the dominant loss mechanism in this study. While idealised solar cells benefit unconditionally from increasing texture height, in realistic cells there is an optimal texture height which maximizes the power conversion efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the opto-electronic advantages of texturing and offer guidance for the design of next-generation textured perovskite-based solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Distillation of atomistic foundation models across architectures and chemical domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials have transformed computational research in the physical sciences. Recent atomistic `foundation' models have changed the field yet again: trained on many different chemical elements and domains, these potentials are widely applicable, but comparably slow and resource-intensive to run. Here we show how distillation via synthetic data can be used to cheaply transfer knowledge from atomistic foundation models to a range of different architectures, unlocking much smaller, more efficient potentials. We demonstrate speed-ups of $&gt; 10\times$ by distilling from one graph-network architecture into another, and $&gt; 100\times$ by leveraging the atomic cluster expansion framework. We showcase applicability across chemical and materials domains: from liquid water to hydrogen under extreme conditions; from porous silica and a hybrid halide perovskite solar-cell material to modelling organic reactions. Our work shows how distillation can support the routine and computationally efficient use of current and future atomistic foundation models in real-world scientific research.</description>

      <title>Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO$_2$) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</description>

      <title>GEARS H: Accurate machine-learned Hamiltonians for next-generation device-scale modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GEARS H, a state-of-the-art machine-learning Hamiltonian framework for large-scale electronic structure simulations. Using GEARS H, we present a statistical analysis of the hole concentration induced in defective $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ interfaced with Ni-doped amorphous $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ as a function of the Ni doping rate, system density, and Se vacancy rate in 72 systems ranging from 3326 to 4160 atoms-a quantity and scale of interface electronic structure calculation beyond the reach of conventional density functional theory codes and other machine-learning-based methods. We further demonstrate the versatility of our architecture by training models for a molecular system, 2D materials with and without defects, solid solution crystals, and bulk amorphous systems with covalent and ionic bonds. The mean absolute error of the inferred Hamiltonian matrix elements from the validation set is below 2.4 meV for all of these models. GEARS H outperforms other proposed machine-learning Hamiltonian frameworks, and our results indicate that machine-learning Hamiltonian methods, starting with GEARS H, are now production-ready techniques for DFT-accuracy device-scale simulation.</description>

      <title>Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory for simulating open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory is a promising approach for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on both classical and quantum platforms, with dynamics that can be realized as a quantum channel. We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\mathrm{polylog}(T/\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning via Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that embeds the Schr\"{o}dinger equation directly into the machine learning procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit in certain settings and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient nanophotonic devices optimization using deep neural network trained with physics-based transfer learning (PBTL) methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network(NN)-based surrogate modeling framework for photonic device optimization, especially in domains with imbalanced feature importance and high data generation costs. Our framework, which comprises physics-based transfer learning (PBTL)-enhanced surrogate modeling and scalarized multi-objective genetic algorithms (GAs), offers a generalizable solution for photonic design automation with minimal data resources.To validate the framework, we optimize mid-infrared quantum cascade laser (QCL) structures consisting of two regions, active and injection, which have different levels of feature importance. The optimization targets include five key QCL performance metrics such as modal gain, emission wavelength, linewidth, and effective injection, extraction energies. To address the challenge of multiple local optima in the output latent space, we integrate a deep neural network total predictor (DNN-TP) with a GA, enabling scalable and nature-inspired optimization. By replacing computationally expensive numerical simulations with the DNN-TP surrogate model, the optimization achieves a speed-up of over 80,000 times, allowing large-scale exploration of the QCL design space.To improve model generalization with limited data, we introduce PBTL, which transfers knowledge from a DNN core predictor (DNN-CP) trained on active-region structures. This approach yields a 0.69 percentage increase in prediction accuracy, equivalent to a 50 percentage reduction in training data requirements, and leads to generate more feasible device structure with 60 percentage improvement in evaluation metric during optimization.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Gaussian basis sets for many-body systems using Rothe's method: A mean-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A challenge in modeling time-dependent strong-field processes such as high-harmonic generation for many-body systems, is how to effectively represent the electronic continuum. We apply Rothe's method to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and density functional theory (TDDFT) equations of motion for the orbitals, which reformulates them as an optimization problem. We show that thawed, complex-valued Gaussian basis sets can be propagated efficiently for these orbital-based approaches, removing the need for grids. In particular, we illustrate that qualitatively correct results can often be obtained by using just a few fully flexible Gaussians that describe the unbound dynamics for both TDHF and TDDFT. Grid calculations can be reproduced quantitatively using $30$--$100$ Gaussians for intensities up to $4\times10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ for the one-dimensional molecular systems considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Dipole-quadrupole coupling in triplet exciton-polaron quenching in a phosphorescent OLED emission layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency and stability of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) will further expand their present success in display applications. Triplet exciton-polaron quenching (TPQ) is an important cause of limited efficiency and stability in modern phosphorescent OLEDs, where triplet excitons are the emitting species. Lack of understanding of the TPQ mechanism in these OLEDs impedes the development of more efficient and stable OLEDs. We investigate the TPQ mechanism for triplet excitons on a phosphorescent guest interacting with hole polarons on a host. Our quantum-chemical calculations show that at distances relevant for TPQ the F\"orster approximation for the TPQ rate fails and that dipole-quadrupole coupling is dominant. This resolves a discrepancy between estimates of the TPQ rate obtained from an OLED device study and from the overlap between the emission spectrum of the emitter and absorption spectrum of the charged host. Equivalently to the F\"orster radius for dipole-dipole TPQ, the dipole-quadrupole TPQ rate can be quantified by a dipole-quadrupole radius obtained from the overlap between the emission spectrum of the emitter and the quadrupolar absorption spectrum of the charged host. The findings of this work are expected to have a broad relevance and to be useful in developing phosphorescent emitter-host combinations with reduced TPQ.</description>

      <title>Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</description>

      <title>Coupled reaction and diffusion governing interface evolution in solid-state batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell, {\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics, underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Defects Enhance Stability in 12-fold Symmetric Soft-Matter Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are materials that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity. In soft matter, the most commonly observed quasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares and triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings nearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an additional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus defects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the critical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Temporal and Topological Partitioning of a Large-Scale Real-World Network: Scale-Free Properties and Minimal Model Comparison</title>

Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale, real-world growing network connecting software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network comprises approximately 6 billion nodes and edges and spans more than 40 years of growth. Our analysis leverages natural partitions of nodes and edges, based on both temporal and topological attributes.
  A derived temporalized graph reveals a global bow-tie-like structure and enables a preliminary investigation of edge dynamics (such as creation, inheritance, and aging) alongside comparisons with minimal models. We analyze degree distributions over time, edge timestamp histograms, and estimates of the in-degree distribution's scaling exponent. The results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and to the presence of numerous outliers, while showing that the proposed partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
  Node types derived from topological and temporal partitions reveal regime shifts associated with changes in developer practices, notably variations in the average number of new edges per new node over time. These structural and dynamical transitions hinder definitive conclusions regarding the existence and observability of a scale-free regime, and underscore the need for advanced tools to study transient growth phases and to facilitate robust comparisons between real-world evolving networks and minimal models.</description>

      <title>The Critical Importance of Software for HEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01050</link>

Abstract: Particle physics has an ambitious and broad global experimental programme for the coming decades. Large investments in building new facilities are already underway or under consideration. Scaling the present processing power and data storage needs by the foreseen increase in data rates in the next decade for HL-LHC is not sustainable within the current budgets. As a result, a more efficient usage of computing resources is required in order to realise the physics potential of future experiments. Software and computing are an integral part of experimental design, trigger and data acquisition, simulation, reconstruction, and analysis, as well as related theoretical predictions. A significant investment in computing and software is therefore critical.
  Advances in software and computing, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), will be key for solving these challenges. Making better use of new processing hardware such as graphical processing units (GPUs) or ARM chips is a growing trend. This forms part of a computing solution that makes efficient use of facilities and contributes to the reduction of the environmental footprint of HEP computing. The HEP community already provided a roadmap for software and computing for the last EPPSU, and this paper updates that, with a focus on the most resource critical parts of our data processing chain.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and stability of neural operators for prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence poses challenges for numerical simulation due to its chaotic, multiscale nature and high computational cost. Traditional turbulence modeling often struggles with accuracy and long-term stability. Recent scientific machine learning (SciML) models, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), show promise in solving PDEs, but are typically limited to one-step-ahead predictions and often fail over long time horizons, especially in 3D turbulence. This study proposes a framework to assess the reliability of neural operator models in turbulent flows. Using three-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) as a benchmark, we evaluate models in terms of uncertainty quantification (UQ), error propagation, and sensitivity to initial perturbations. Statistical tools such as error distribution analysis and autocorrelation functions (ACF) are used to assess predictive robustness and temporal coherence. Our proposed model, the factorized-implicit FNO (F-IFNO), improves long-term stability and accuracy by incorporating implicit factorization into the prediction process. It outperforms conventional LES and other FNO-based models in balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of prediction constraints, time interval selection, and UQ in developing robust neural operator frameworks for turbulent systems.</description>
