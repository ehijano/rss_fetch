      <title>Portfolio optimization in incomplete markets and price constraints determined by maximum entropy in the mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solution to a portfolio optimization problem is always conditioned by constraints on the initial capital and the price of the available market assets. If a risk neutral measure is known, then the price of each asset is the discounted expected value of the asset's price under this measure. But if the market is incomplete, the risk neutral measure is not unique, and there is a range of possible prices for each asset, which can be identified with bid-ask ranges. We present in this paper an effective method to determine the current prices of a collection of assets in incomplete markets, and such that these prices comply with the cost constraints for a portfolio optimization problem. Our workhorse is the method of maximum entropy in the mean to adjust a distortion function from bid-ask market data. This distortion function plays the role of a risk neutral measure, which is used to price the assets, and the distorted probability that it determines reproduces bid-ask market values. We carry out numerical examples to study the effect on portfolio returns of the computation of prices of the assets conforming the portfolio with the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Dimensional Barrier: A Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization for Continuous-Time Multi-Asset Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11116</link>

Abstract: Solving large-scale, continuous-time portfolio optimization problems involving numerous assets and state-dependent dynamics has long been challenged by the curse of dimensionality. Traditional dynamic programming and PDE-based methods, while rigorous, typically become computationally intractable beyond a few state variables (~3-6 limit in prior studies). To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) framework. Our framework accurately captures both myopic demand and complex intertemporal hedging demands, a feat often elusive for other methods in high-dimensional settings. P-PGDPO delivers near-optimal policies, offering a practical and powerful alternative for a broad class of high-dimensional continuous-time control problems. PG-DPO leverages Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) to directly inform neural network-based policy learning. A key contribution is our highly efficient Projected PG-DPO (P-PGDPO) variant. This approach uniquely utilizes BPTT to obtain rapidly stabilizing estimates of the Pontryagin costates and their crucial derivatives with respect to the state variables. These estimates are then analytically projected onto the manifold of optimal controls dictated by PMP's first-order conditions, significantly reducing training overhead and enhancing accuracy. This enables a breakthrough in scalability: numerical experiments demonstrate that P-PGDPO successfully tackles problems with dimensions previously considered far out of reach (up to 50 assets and 10 state variables).</description>
