      <title>P-time Algorithms for Typical #EO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of counting weighted Eulerian orientations, denoted as #EO problems. We prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for #EO defined by a set of binary and quaternary signatures, which generalizes the dichotomy for the six-vertex model. We also prove a dichotomy for #EO defined by a set of pure signatures. Furthermore, we present a polynomial time algorithm for #EO problems defined by rebalancing signatures, which include a non-pure signature $f_{40}$. We also construct a signature $f_{56}$ that is not rebalancing, while whether #EO$(f_{56})$ is computable in polynomial time remains unsettled.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the rates of growth and convergence of all physical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upper limit on what is computable in our universe is unknown, but widely believed to be set by the Turing machine -- with a function being physically computable if and only if it is Turing-computable. I show how this apparently mild assumption leads to generous yet binding limits on how quickly or slowly any directly measurable physical phenomenon can grow or converge -- limits that are intimately connected to Rado's Busy Beaver function. I conjecture that these limits are novel physical laws governing which rates of growth and convergence are possible in our universe.</description>

      <title>Power of Counting by Nonuniform Families of Polynomial-Size Finite Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lately, there have been intensive studies on strengths and limitations of nonuniform families of promise decision problems solvable by various types of polynomial-size finite automata families, where "polynomial-size" refers to the polynomially-bounded state complexity of a finite automata family. In this line of study, we further expand the scope of these studies to families of partial counting and gap functions, defined in terms of nonuniform families of polynomial-size nondeterministic finite automata, and their relevant families of promise decision problems. Counting functions have an ability of counting the number of accepting computation paths produced by nondeterministic finite automata. With no unproven hardness assumption, we show numerous separations and collapses of complexity classes of those partial counting and gap function families and their induced promise decision problem families. We also investigate their relationships to pushdown automata families of polynomial stack-state complexity.</description>

      <title>The Reachability Problem for Neural-Network Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A control system consists of a plant component and a controller which periodically computes a control input for the plant. We consider systems where the controller is implemented by a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations. The reachability problem asks, given a set of initial states, whether a set of target states can be reached. We show that this problem is undecidable even for trivial plants and fixed-depth neural networks with three inputs and outputs. We also show that the problem becomes semi-decidable when the plant as well as the input and target sets are given by automata over infinite words.</description>
