      <title>Spontaneous and Induced Oscillations in Confined Epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feedback between mechanical and chemical signals plays a key role in controlling many biological processes and collective cell behavior. Here we focus on the emergence of spatiotemporal density waves in a one-dimensional "cell train." Combining a minimal theoretical model with observations in an in vitro experimental system of MDCK epithelial cells confined to a linear pattern, we examine the spontaneous oscillations driven by the feedback between myosin activation and mechanical deformations and their effect on the response of the tissue to externally applied deformations. We show that the nature and frequency of spontaneous oscillations is controlled by the size of the cell train, with a transition from size-dependent standing waves to intrinsic spontaneous waves at the natural frequency of the tissue. The response to external boundary perturbations exhibit a resonance at this natural frequency, providing a possible venue for inferring the mechanochemical couplings that control the tissue behavior from rheological experiments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Biomarkers on Haemodynamics in Atherosclerotic Artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease, leads to arterial constriction caused by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, and various substances within artery walls. Such plaque can rupture, resulting in a blood clot that obstructs major arteries and may initiate myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, etc. Atherosclerotic plaque formation begins with the accumulation of foam cells and macrophages within the intima layer of the arterial wall. At the latter stage, the smooth muscle cells migrated from deeper artery wall layers, contributing to the fibrous cap formation and plaque stabilizing. A developed plaque gradually enters the lumen and narrows down the lumen to impede blood flow. We introduce a two-phase and macroscopic model to investigate the progression of plaque growth in its advanced stage and analyze the minimum gap (Lumen Clearance) within an atherosclerotic artery so that blood cells can pass through. Cardiac troponin, a high specificity and sensitivity biomarker, facilitates early detection of elevated myocardial infarction, Ischemic stroke, etc. risks. This study aims to establish a relationship between the troponin concentration in atherosclerotic arteries and their internal clearance, which could significantly improve our understanding of disease progression. Our observations show that the plaque undergoes rapid evolution in its initial stages, gradually slowing down over time to reach a steady state. At the same time, the lumen clearance exhibits an opposite behavior, decreasing slowly over time. Our study finds a positive correlation between plaque depth and troponin concentration in the blood and a negative relationship between troponin concentrations and lumen clearance in atherosclerotic arteries.</description>

      <title>Accurate QM/MM Molecular Dynamics for Periodic Systems in \textsc{GPU4PySCF} with Applications to Enzyme Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method for periodic systems using GPU accelerated QM methods, a distributed multipole formulation of the electrostatics, and a pseudo-bond treatment of the QM/MM boundary. We demonstrate that our method has well-controlled errors, stable self-consistent QM convergence, and energy-conserving dynamics. We further describe an application to the catalytic kinetics of chorismate mutase. Using an accurate hybrid functional reparametrized to coupled cluster energetics, our QM/MM simulations highlight the sensitivity in the calculated rate to the choice of quantum method, quantum region selection, and local protein conformation. Our work is provided through the open-source \textsc{PySCF} package using acceleration from the \textsc{GPU4PySCF} module.</description>

      <title>Ghost channels and ghost cycles guiding long transients in dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical descriptions and modeling of natural systems have generally focused on fixed points, with saddles and saddle-based phase-space objects such as heteroclinic channels/cycles being central concepts behind the emergence of quasi-stable long transients. Reliable and robust transient dynamics observed for real, inherently noisy systems is, however, not met by saddle-based dynamics, as demonstrated here. Generalizing the notion of ghost states, we provide a complementary framework that does not rely on the precise knowledge or existence of (un)stable fixed points, but rather on slow directed flows organized by ghost sets in ghost channels and ghost cycles. Moreover, we show that appearance of these novel objects is an emergent property of a broad class of models, typically used for description of natural systems.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work. Although the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of debate, it is generally agreed that Pi-release into the solution doesn't occur instantly upon the binding of a myosin to actin. Here, we examine how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction. Utilizing a cross-scale mechanics model for a sarcomere unit that integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction in silico. Our analysis leads us to propose that gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the bond strength of an attached myosin, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. When our model is applied to simulate muscle performance in response to rapid jumps in Pi concentrations, we observe asymmetric rates of force alteration, which corroborate previous experimental findings. Indeed, our model's predictions in the current work are largely consistent with experimental data. This research provides crucial insights into the kinetics of Pi-release within the myosin's chemomechanical cycle and its significant regulatory impact on muscle contraction.</description>

      <title>Charge separation at liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory for phase-separated liquid coacervates with salt, taking into account spatial heterogeneities and interfacial profiles. We find that charged layers of alternating sign can form around the interface while the bulk phases remain approximately charge-neutral. We show that the salt concentration regulates the number of layers and the amplitude of the layer's charge density and electrostatic potential. Such charged layers can either repel or attract single-charged molecules diffusing across the interface. Our theory could be relevant for artificial systems and biomolecular condensates in cells. Our work suggests that interfaces of biomolecular condensates could mediate charge-specific transport similar to membrane-bound compartments.</description>
