      <title>Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Economic Hubs and the Domination of Inter-Regional Ties in World City Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities are widely considered the lifeblood of a nations economy housing the bulk of industries, commercial and trade activities, and employment opportunities. Within this economic context, multinational corporations play an important role in this economic development of cities in particular, and subsequently the countries and regions they belong to, in general. As multinational companies are spread throughout the world by virtue of ownership-subsidiary relationship, these ties create complex inter-dependent networks of cities that shape and define socio-economic status, as well as macro-regional influences impacting the world economy.
  In this paper, we study these networks of cities formed as a result of ties between multinational firms. We analyze these networks using intra-regional, inter-regional and hybrid ties (conglomerate integration) as spatial motifs defined by geographic delineation of world's economic regions. We attempt to understand how global cities position themselves in spatial and economic geographies and how their ties promote regional integration along with global expansion for sustainable growth and economic development. We study these networks over four time periods from 2010 to 2019 and discover interesting trends and patterns. The most significant result is the domination of inter-regional motifs representing cross regional ties among cities rather than national and regional integration.</description>

      <title>Relations of society concepts and religions from Wikipedia networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Google matrix of directed networks of Wikipedia articles related to 8 recent Wikipedia language editions representing different cultures (English, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese). Using the reduced Google matrix algorithm we determine relations and interactions of 23 society concepts and 17 religions represented by their respective articles for each of the 8 editions. The effective Markov transitions are found to be more intense inside the two blocks of society concepts and religions while transitions between the blocks are significantly reduced. We establish 5 poles of influence for society concepts (Law, Society, Communism, Liberalism, Capitalism) as well as 5 poles for religions (Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion) and determine how they affect other entries. We compute inter edition correlations for different key quantities providing a quantitative analysis of the differences or the proximity of views of the 8 cultures with respect to the selected society concepts and religions.</description>

      <title>Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Democratic governments comprise a subset of a population whose goal is to produce coherent decisions that solve societal challenges while respecting the will of the people they represent. New governance frameworks represent this problem as a social network rather than as a hierarchical pyramid with centralized authority. But how should this network be structured? To investigate this question, we model the set of decisions a population must make as a satisfiability problem and the structure of information flow involved in decision-making as a social hypergraph. This allows us to consider the benefits of different governance structures, from dictatorships to direct democracy. In between these extremes, we find a regime of effective governance where decision groups are formed as needed by key stakeholders to discuss and make specific decisions. This regime of effective governance allows even incoherent or polarized populations to make coherent decisions at low coordination costs. More broadly, we present not just simulation results, but a modeling framework that can be used to explore the costs and benefits of a wide range of governance strategies using bottom-up approaches and their ability to tackle decision problems that challenge standard governments.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop MGA to generate energy system design options matching stakeholder needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The common use of cost minimisation to support energy system design decisions hides from view many economically comparable design options that stakeholders may prefer. Modelling to generate alternatives (MGA) is increasingly popular as a way to go beyond least-cost designs, providing stakeholders with diverse portfolios to appraise. However, generating all the feasible designs is not computationally viable; modellers must choose what design features to generate diversity around, despite not knowing which trade-offs matter the most in practice. Therefore, MGA alone cannot ensure the generation of design options that match stakeholder needs. To address this shortcoming, we propose a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach that automatically integrates stakeholder preferences into MGA. We elicit preferences by letting stakeholders interact with a tentative MGA design space. Hence, we decode those preferences to feed them back to the MGA algorithm and perform a guided search. This search produces a human-trained design space with more designs that mirror the elicited preferences. A synthetic experiment for the Portuguese energy system shows that HITL-MGA may facilitate consensus formation, promising to accelerate technically and socially feasible energy transition decisions.</description>
