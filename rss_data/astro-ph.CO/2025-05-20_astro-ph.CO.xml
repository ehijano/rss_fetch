      <title>The Prospect from the Upcoming CMB Experiment LiteBIRD to Discover Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Quintessence Dark Energy from non-perturbative Higgs-Yang-Mills mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that dark energy arises from a strongly-coupled Higgs-Yang-Mills set of interacting fields in the non-perturbative regime. We choose the simplest $SU(2)$ representation, which is compatible with the Cosmological Principle. One of the components of the Higgs doublet act as an effective quintessence scalar field interacting with both gravity and the gauge field. We devise a multiple time scale approach to solve the equations of motion through a hierarchy of the couplings, utilizing exact solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. We observe that the time scale of variation of the Hubble constant is the slowest one, while, for the scalar field, assuming that its self-coupling is smaller than the coupling of the gauge field, represents an intermediate time scale. From the consistency of the Friedmann equations, we show how the effect of the scalar field is to give origin to dark energy with a proper equation of state corrected by a very small time-dependent term. Finally, agreement with cosmological data for the dark energy density is shown without relying on the fine-tuning of the physical constants of the model.</description>

      <title>Cluster optical depth and pairwise velocity estimation using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply two machine learning methods, a CNN deep-leaning model and a gradient-boosting decision tree, to estimate individual cluster optical depths from observed properties derived from multiple complementary datasets. The models are trained and tested with simulated N-body derived halo catalogs and synthetic full-sky CMB maps designed to mirror data from the DESI and Simons Observatory experiments. Specifically, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) and CMB lensing convergence, along with cluster virial mass estimates are used as features to train the machine learning models. The predicted optical depths are combined with kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements to estimate individual cluster radial peculiar velocities. The method is shown to recover an unbiased estimate of the pairwise velocity statistics of the simulated cluster sample. The model's efficacy is demonstrated for halos with mass range $10^{13} M_{\odot} &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{15} M_{\odot}$ over a redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;1$, and validated in the presence of primary CMB, instrument noise, lensing convergence noise, and potential uncertainties in halo virial mass estimates. We apply the method to ACT CMB data, using ACT DR4 component-separated maps for tSZ and CMB lensing and ACT DR5 maps for kSZ, in conjunction with galaxy clusters observed in the SDSS DR15 spectroscopic survey. We demonstrate that the machine learning approach is an effective one to analyze data from current and upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CCAT, and galaxy surveys, such as DESI and Roman, for which the pairwise velocity statistics can provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrinos and gravity on cosmic scales.</description>

      <title>The polynomial potential inflation in light of ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data, challenging many well-established inflationary models. In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, focusing on the quadratic ($n=2$) and cubic ($n=3$) models. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic model can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Our findings show that higher-order polynomial potentials remain viable for describing cosmic inflation, demonstrating how recent precision measurements continue to refine our understanding of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Did the Corona Borealis-A2142 supercluster binary-like system originate as a proto-cluster binary embedded in a primordial cloud of galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the giant binary-like system composed by the Corona Borealis and Abell 2142 superclusters is an intriguing conundrum of the formation of large scale structures since, from the observational point of view, it represents a rare peculiarity in the distribution of massive galaxy superclusters. Having a configuration similar to a giant binary system interconnected by a huge filament, it is likely one if not the unique case to date observed in the Local Universe. So a question arise: how and when did it form? Here, the CrB and A2142 system has been hypothesized to be a descendent of a primordial binary system composed of two close galaxy proto-clusters, the CrB and A2142, originated from two independent collapsing process within a dense cloud of galaxies. Then, assuming that at a certain point the decoupling occurred due to the interplay of gravity-antigravity of DE, they began to move away in radial motion from each other following the accelerate expansion of the Universe. In the context of the LCDM model a Newtonian approximation of the two body motion in presence of DE has been applied using current physical parameters of the CrB and A2142 system with the aim to calculate the look-back time at decoupling. Its compatibility with the era of formation of the primordial galaxy proto-clusters has been tested. The event of the binary decoupling happened in a time larger than the age of the Universe! Of course, after such a result the advanced hypothesis on the origins of the CrB-A2142 system can be rejected, but not the test of compatibility since the look-back time at the error lower limit is 12.5 Gys ( z = 4.5) largely consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernova growth-rate measurement with LSST simulations: intrinsic scatter systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of the growth rate of structures ($\fsig$) with Type Ia supernovae (\sns) will improve our understanding of the nature of dark energy and enable tests of general relativity. In this paper, we generate simulations of the 10 year \sn\ dataset of the Rubin-LSST survey, including a correlated velocity field from a N-body simulation and realistic models of \sns\ properties and their correlations with host-galaxy properties. We find, similar to SN~Ia analyses that constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameters $w_0w_a$, that constraints on $\fsig$ can be biased depending on the intrinsic scatter of \sns. While for the majority of intrinsic scatter models we recover $\fsig$ with a precision of $\sim13 - 14\%$, for the most realistic dust-based model, we find that the presence of non-Gaussianities in Hubble diagram residuals leads to a bias on $\fsig$ of about $\sim-20\%$. When trying to correct for the dust-based intrinsic scatter, we find that the propagation of the uncertainty on the model parameters does not significantly increase the error on $\fsig$. We also find that while the main component of the error budget of $\fsig$ is the statistical uncertainty ($&gt;75\%$ of the total error budget), the systematic error budget is dominated by the uncertainty on the damping parameter, $\sigma_u$, that gives an empirical description of the effect of redshift space distortions on the velocity power spectrum. Our results motivate a search for new methods to correct for the non-Gaussian distribution of the Hubble diagram residuals, as well as an improved modeling of the damping parameter.</description>

      <title>Kinematic dynamos and resolution limits for Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and evolution of magnetic fields on cosmological scales opens up a window into the physics of the early Universe. Numerical simulations of such fields require a careful treatment to faithfully solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) without introducing numerical artefacts. In this paper, we study the growth of the magnetic fields in controlled kinematic dynamo setups using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementations in the SWIFT code. We assess the quality of the reconstructed solution in the Roberts flow case against the reference implementation in the Pencil code and find generally a good agreement. Similarly, we reproduce the known features of the more complex ABC flow. Using a simple induction-diffusion balance model to analyse the results, we construct an "overwinding" trigger metric to locally detect regions where the magnetic diffusion cannot counteract the expected induction because of limitations in the method's ability to resolve magnetic field gradients. This metric is then used to identify the necessary resolution and resistivity levels to counteract the overwinding problem. We finally apply this metric to adiabatic cosmological simulations and discuss the resolution requirements needed to resolve the growth of the primordial fields without artefacts.</description>

      <title>Filtering out large-scale noise for cluster weak-lensing mass estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for estimating galaxy cluster masses using weak-lensing magnification. The effect of weak-lensing magnification introduces a correlation between the position of foreground galaxy clusters and the density of background sources. Therefore, cluster masses can be inferred through observations of these correlations. In this work, we introduce a method that allows us to considerably reduce noise correlations between different radial bins of the cluster magnification signal via a Wiener filtering of our observed magnification field on large scales. This method can reduce the uncertainty on the estimated galaxy cluster mass and it can also be applied to cluster mass estimation for weak-lensing shear. The method was applied to Hyper-Suprime Cam galaxies and CAMIRA clusters detected within the Hyper-Suprime Cam survey (HSC). With HSC data, we find that our filtering method significantly reduces the correlation of noise between radial magnification bins. The estimated cluster mass is consistent between the filtered and unfiltered methods, with similar errors between the two methods as our current measurement errors contain significant contributions from the irreducible shot-noise. For deeper surveys, the effects of shot noise will be less important and this method will lead to greater improvements on the estimated cluster mass.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the modified gravity corrections. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>Wonderings on Wiggly Bispectra: Non-linear Evolution and Reconstruction of Oscillations in the Squeezed Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillations in the primordial bispectrum are sourced by a range of inflationary phenomena, including features in the inflaton potential and interactions with massive fields through the Cosmological Collider scenario. These signatures offer a powerful window into early-universe physics. In this work, we study how oscillations of the form $\lim_{q\ll k}B(q,k)\propto \cos(\mu \ln(q/k))$ impact the non-linear squeezed matter bispectrum. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions, we show that non-linear evolution significantly damps these oscillations, effectively erasing the signal on scales $k \gtrsim 0.3~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at redshift $z=0$. This damping is well-described by the Zel'dovich approximation and can be modeled deep into the non-linear regime using non-perturbative separate universe simulations. Promisingly, we show that reconstruction techniques developed for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analyses can largely undo this damping, improving constraints on the amplitude (phase) of oscillations in the primordial squeezed bispectrum by up to a factor of five (four) at $z=0$. We also discuss several challenges with modeling the non-linear evolution of the squeezed bispectrum in the Cosmological Collider scenario, where the bispectrum is suppressed by a factor of $(q/k)^{3/2}$ relative to the template studied here. Our findings pave the way for future searches for oscillatory bispectra using large-scale structure data.</description>

      <title>Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</description>

      <title>Dust stars in the minimal exponential measure model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of horizonless compact object solutions supported by dust in the Minimal Exponential Measure (MEMe) model, a theory which modifies the couplings between gravity and matter without introducing dynamical degrees of freedom. For a perfect fluid source, the field equations for the MEMe model can be rewritten as the Einstein field equations sourced by a perfect fluid with a transformed equation of state, which can endow a sufficiently dense cloud of dust with an effective pressure. The resulting dust-supported horizonless compact objects can have masses below $\sim 10^{-11}~M_\odot$, making them suitable as MACHOs comprising a significant mass fraction for dark matter. A necessary condition for the existence of these compact object solutions is that the single free parameter in the MEMe model is positive-valued. Additionally, we find that this positive sign for the parameter can provide a mechanism for suppressing the formation of (primordial) black holes from the gravitational collapse of matter below a certain mass scale.</description>

      <title>First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XIX: Supermassive black hole mergers in the early Universe and their environmental dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{seed} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9} M_{\odot}$, resulting in mass ratios from $q \sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \sim 1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{merger} = 10^{-3.80} (1 + \delta)^{4.56}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \lesssim M_{tot} / M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a detection rate of 0.030 $yr^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio $SNR \geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.</description>

      <title>Constraining Reheating Temperature, Inflaton-SM Coupling and Dark Matter Mass in Light of ACT DR6 Observations</title>

Abstract: We explore the phenomenological implications of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 observations, in combination with Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, on the physics of inflation and post-inflationary reheating. We focus on the $\alpha$-attractor class of inflationary models (both E- and T-models) and consider two reheating scenarios: perturbative inflaton ($\phi$) decay ($\phi \rightarrow bb$) and inflaton annihilation ($\phi \phi \rightarrow bb$) into Standard Model (SM) bosonic particles ($b$). By solving the Boltzmann equations, we derive bounds on key reheating parameters, including the reheating temperature, the inflaton equation of state (EoS), and the inflaton-SM coupling, in light of ACT data. To accurately constrain the coupling, we incorporate the Bose enhancement effect in the decay width. To ensure the validity of our perturbative approach, we also identify the regime where nonperturbative effects, such as parametric resonance, become significant. Additionally, we include indirect constraints from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), which can impact the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. These constraints further bound the reheating temperature, particularly in scenarios with a stiff EoS. Finally, we analyze dark matter (DM) production through purely gravitational interactions during reheating and determine the allowed mass ranges consistent with the constrained reheating parameter space and recent ACT data. Our results highlight the constraining power of next-generation CMB datasets on inflationary dynamics, reheating, and the DM parameter space.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Signatures in the Galaxy Bispectrum</title>

Abstract: In the Standard Model, neutrinos are massless. However, oscillation experiments demonstrate that they do have a small mass. Currently, only the differences of the masses squared are known, along with an upper bound on their sum. Upcoming surveys of the Universe's Large-Scale Structure (LSS) offer a promising avenue to probe neutrino mass by revealing how neutrinos influence galaxy clustering. Massive neutrinos affect mode coupling within the framework of Perturbation Theory (PT) for structure formation, leaving detectable signatures in the PT kernels. In this work, we present for the first time the explicit modifications to the kernels caused by massive neutrinos and investigate the extent of these changes in the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum. To this end, we generate synthetic data using a theoretical covariance matrix and employ Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to assess the impact of these new signature terms. This approach, in contrast to Fisher forecasting, allows us to see if the new terms induce shifts in the recovered central values of parameters. The synthetic data is produced to mirror two different galaxy samples. The first corresponds to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 CMASS Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample, characterized by an effective volume of $V_{\rm eff} = 3 \;[{\rm Gpc}/h]^3$ and a number density of $\bar{n} = 3 \times 10^{-4} \;h/{\rm Mpc}$. The second corresponds to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 5 LRG sample with $V_{\rm eff} = 25 \;[{\rm Gpc}/h]^3$. Our findings indicate that neglecting neutrino mass effects in the kernels can result in a central value shift equivalent to approximately $1\sigma$ in the galaxy biases estimated from the DESI Y5-like sample. For the BOSS CMASS volume, the shift, though not statistically significant, is non-negligible.</description>

      <title>Probing early structure and model-independent neutrino mass with high-redshift CMB lensing mass maps</title>

Abstract: CMB lensing maps probe the mass distribution in projection out to high redshifts, but significant sensitivity to low-redshift structure remains. In this paper we discuss a method to remove the low-redshift contributions from CMB lensing mass maps by subtracting suitably scaled galaxy density maps, nulling the low redshift structure with a model-insensitive procedure that is similar to delensing. This results in a high-$z$-only mass map that can provide a probe of structure growth at uniquely high redshifts: if systematics can be controlled, we forecast that CMB-S4 lensing combined with a Rubin-LSST-like galaxy survey can probe the amplitude of structure at redshifts $z&gt;3.75$ ($z&gt;5$) to within $2.3\%$ ($3.3\%$). We then discuss other example applications of such high-$z$ CMB lensing maps. In standard analyses of CMB lensing, assuming the wrong dark energy model (or wrong model parametrization) can lead to biases in neutrino mass constraints. In contrast, we show with forecasts that a high-$z$ mass map constructed from CMB-S4 lensing and LSST galaxies can provide a nearly model-independent neutrino mass constraint, with only negligible sensitivity to the presence of non-standard dark energy models, irrespective of their parametrization.</description>

Abstract: Future low-noise cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from e.g., CMB-S4 will be polarization dominated, rather than temperature dominated. In this new regime, statistically optimal lensing reconstructions outperform the standard quadratic estimator, but their sensitivity to extragalactic polarized foregrounds has not been quantified. Using realistic simulations of polarized radio and infrared point sources, we show for the first time that optimal Bayesian lensing from a CMB-S4-like experiment is insensitive to the expected level of polarized extragalactic foregrounds after masking, as long as an accurate foreground power spectrum is included in the analysis. For more futuristic experiments where these foregrounds could cause a detectable bias, we propose a new method to jointly fit for lensing and the Poisson foregrounds, generalizing the bias hardening from the standard quadratic estimator to Bayesian lensing.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly Gaussian and the loop corrections to be under perturbative control impose strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. These bounds depend on the hierarchy of the masses in the theory such as whether or not the masses are at the similar orders. While the mass of the heaviest field in the hierarchy may not be constrained but it is shown that a combination of the masses of the fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that this combined mass scale is lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of nonlinear galaxy bias with a theoretical-error likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stage-IV galaxy surveys will measure correlations at small cosmological scales with high signal-to-noise ratio. One of the main challenges of extracting information from small scales is devising accurate models, as well as characterizing the theoretical uncertainties associated with any given model. In this work, we explore the mitigation of theoretical uncertainty due to nonlinear galaxy bias in the context of photometric 2$\times$2-pt analyses. We consider linear galaxy bias as the fiducial model and derive the contribution to the covariance matrix induced by neglected higher-order bias. We construct a covariance matrix for the theoretical error in galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using simulation-based relations that connect higher-order parameters to linear bias. We test the modified likelihood in 2$\times$2-pt analyses based on two sets of mock data vectors: (1) simulated data vectors, constructed from those same relations between bias parameters, and (2) data vectors based on the AbacusSummit simulation suite. We then compare the performance of the theoretical-error approach to the commonly employed scale cuts. We find most theoretical-error configurations yield results equivalent to the scale cuts in terms of precision and accuracy, in some cases producing significantly stronger bounds on cosmological parameters. These results are independent of the maximum scale $k_\mathrm{max}$ in the analysis with theoretical error. The scenarios where linear bias supplemented by theoretical error is unable to recover unbiased cosmology are connected to inadequate modeling of the $gg$-$g\kappa$ covariance of theoretical error. In view of its removing the ambiguity in the choice of $k_\mathrm{max}$, as well as the possibility of attaining higher precision than the usual scale cuts, we consider this method to be promising for analyses of LSS in upcoming photometric galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Connecting Inflation to the NANOGrav 15-year Data Set via Massive Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) missions have reported convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background within their latest datasets. This background could originate from an astrophysical source, though there are multiple possibilities for its origin to be cosmological. Focusing on the NANOGrav signal, which was in good agreement with other PTAs, we evaluate the possibility of an inflationary source for the background. However, we'll consider a time-dependent minimal theory of massive gravity instead of standard general relativity for our analysis. We find that an inflationary interpretation will require a strongly blue spectrum, characterized by $n_T = 1.8 \, \pm \, 0.54$, while Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits will require a low reheating scale of $T_\text{rh} \simeq 4000 \ \text{GeV}$. Though these constraints make it difficult for inflation to be the source of the NANOGrav signal, we find that the massive gravity model allows for a greater reheating temperature than standard general relativity, making an inflationary interpretation slightly less cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence principle across the Universe: a model-independent approach with galaxy multi-tracing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a test of the equivalence principle on cosmological scales. This cornerstone of general relativity has been tested with high precision for standard matter, but its validity for the unknown dark matter remains a crucial open question. We construct a measurable quantity $E_P$ that acts as a null test, i.e. it deviates from unity whenever the weak equivalence principle is violated. This quantity can be directly measured from the cross-correlation of two different galaxy populations, thanks to the inclusion of large-scale relativistic corrections. A key feature of our approach is that it only involves minimal assumptions, without the need to specify the power spectrum shape, the background evolution, the growth rate of cosmic structure, the galaxy bias function or a model for the potential violation of the equivalence principle. We provide forecasts for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). While the relativistic corrections can be detected with high significance by both surveys, $E_P$ can be constrained up to an interesting level only by SKA, with a precision around 10-15$\%$.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources are standard sirens that provide an independent way to map the cosmic expansion history by combining with an independent redshift measurement either from an electromagnetic counterpart for a bright siren or using different statistical techniques for dark sirens. In this analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge (\texttt{Blinded-MDC}) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble constant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass distribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different analysis setups for the \texttt{Blinded-MDC} to test both statistical and systematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$ with detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs matches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline can recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution. However, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population depends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the data, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by about $1.5\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a limited number of events. In the future, elaborate studies will be required to mitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical complexities. This MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy of standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness of the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from the Minkowski functionals of the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we develop a simulation-based model for the Minkowski functionals (MFs) of large-scale structure, which allows us to extract the full information available from the MFs (including both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian part), and apply it to the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample. Our model is based on high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs constructed from the \textsc{Abacus}\textsc{Summit} simulations using the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, which include the redshift-space distortions and Alcock-Paczynski distortions, incorporate survey realism, including survey geometry and veto masks, and account for angular plus radial selection effects. The cosmological and HOD parameter dependence of the MFs is captured with a neural network emulator trained from the galaxy mocks with various cosmological and HOD parameters. To benchmark the constraining power of the MFs, we also train an emulator for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) using the same pipeline. Having validated our approach through successful parameter recovery tests on both internal and external mocks, including non-HOD forward models of the halo-galaxy connection, we apply our forward model to analyze the CMASS data in the redshift range $0.45&lt;z&lt;0.58$. We find the MFs provide stronger constraints on the cosmological parameters than the 2PCF. The combination of the two gives $\omega_{\rm cdm}=0.1172^{+0.0020}_{-0.0023}$, $\sigma_8=0.783\pm 0.026$, and $n_s=0.966^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$, which are tighter by a factor of 2.0, 1.9, and 1.6 than the 2PCF alone. The derived constraint $f\sigma_8=0.453 \pm 0.016$ is also improved by a factor of 1.9, compared to the 2PCF, and agrees well with Planck 2018 predictions and other results from a series of studies in the literature.</description>

      <title>Non-halo structures and their effects on gravitationally lensed galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the $\Lambda$CDM model succeeds on large scales, its validity on smaller scales remains uncertain. Recent works suggest that non-halo dark matter structures, such as filaments and walls, could significantly influence gravitational lensing and that the importance of these effects depends on the dark matter model: in warm dark matter scenarios, fewer low-mass objects form and thus their mass is redistributed into the cosmic-web. We investigate these effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing using fragmentation-free Warm Dark Matter (WDM) simulations with particle masses of m$_{\chi}$ = 1 keV and m$_{\chi}$ = 3 keV. Although these cosmological scenarios are already observationally excluded, the fraction of mass falling outside of haloes grows with the thermal velocity of the dark matter particles, which allows for the search for first-order effects. We create mock datasets, based on gravitationally-lensed systems from the BELLS-Gallery, incorporating non-halo contributions from these simulations to study their impact in comparison to mocks where the lens has a smooth mass distribution. Using Bayesian modelling, we find that perturbations from WDM non-halo structures produce an effect on the inferred parameters of the main lens and shift the reconstructed source position. However, these variations are subtle and are effectively absorbed by standard elliptical power-law lens models, making them challenging to distinguish from intrinsic lensing features. Most importantly, non-halo perturbation does not appear as a strong external shear term, which is commonly used in gravitational lensing analyses to represent large-scale perturbations. Our results demonstrate that while non-halo structures can affect the lensing analysis, the overall impact remains indistinguishable from variations of the main lens in colder WDM and CDM scenarios, where non-halo contributions are smaller.</description>

      <title>Testing the local void hypothesis using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_{\mathrm{V}}$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the homogeneous model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 42 considered $D_{\mathrm{V}}$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 75.7 for the void-free model, while the void models give only $47.3 - 51.2$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.3\sigma$ without a void to $1.1\sigma - 1.4\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth. The void-free model provides the worst fit in almost every case. Overall, our results suggest that recent evidence of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The DESI DR1/DR2 evidence for dynamical dark energy is biased by low-redshift supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a $3\sim4\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy has been reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, which has inspired hot debates on new physics or systematics. In this letter, we reveal that this preference is significantly biased by an external low-redshift supernova (low-$z$ SN) sample, which was combined with the Dark Energy Survey SN program (DES-SN) in their Year-Five data release (DESY5). Using the intercept in the SN magnitude-distance relation as a diagnostic for systematics, we find not only large dispersions but also a large discrepancy in the low-$z$ SN sample when compared to the high-$z$ DES-SN sample within the single DESY5 compilation. Correcting for this low-$z$ systematics with or without including the cosmic microwave background data can largely reduce the preference for dynamical DE to be less than $2\sigma$. Therefore, the DESI preference for dynamical DE is biased by some unknown systematics in the low-$z$ SN sample.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the inflaton potential from scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plateau on the background inflaton potential $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ can lead cosmic inflation into an ultraslow-roll phase, greatly enhancing the primordial power spectrum on small scales, and resulting in intensive scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) and abundant primordial black holes (PBHs). In this work, we construct an anti-symmetric perturbation $\delta V(\phi)$ on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ with three model parameters, the position, width, and slope of $\delta V(\phi)$, and constrain these parameters from the potential stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. The GW spectrum from the merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with two model parameters, the amplitude and spectral index, is also investigated for comparison. We perform Bayesian analysis in three steps with increasing number of model parameters, and obtain the allowed parameter ranges. When the constraints on PBH abundance are taken into account, these ranges become further narrower. We find that the increase of model parameters cannot significantly improve the Bayes factors, and the model with an almost perfect plateau on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ is favored. Moreover, the interpretation of the SGWB only via the GWs generated by SMBHBs is not preferred by the data. Two different forms of $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ are considered, and the analogous results confirm the generality and robustness of our work.</description>

      <title>Cosmological zoom-in simulation of fuzzy dark matter down to z = 0: tidal evolution of subhaloes in a Milky Way-sized halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subhaloes are critical in distinguishing dark matter models, yet their evolution within galactic haloes, particularly in the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) model, remains challenging to fully investigate in numerical simulations. In this work, we employ the fluid-wave hybrid scheme recently implemented in the GAMER-2 code to perform a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-sized halo with an FDM particle mass of m = 2 x 10^(-23) eV. It simultaneously resolves the solitonic core of the host halo and tracks the complex tidal evolution of subhaloes down to redshift z = 0. We examine the internal structure of subhaloes by analyzing their density profiles, velocity dispersions, and density power spectra across various redshifts. Our findings show that partially tidally stripped subhaloes deviate from the core-halo mass relation; their solitons remain intact and are enveloped by smaller granules predominantly from the host halo. Furthermore, our simulation unravels a complex tidal evolution of FDM subhaloes. On the one hand, we observe a subhalo core undergoing complete tidal disruption at z ~ 0.14, which later reemerges near the outskirts of the host halo around z ~ 0. This disruption event, characterized by a core contaminated with interference fringes from the host halo's wave function, occurs earlier than previously predicted. On the other hand, FDM subhaloes have denser cores before infall due to the presence of central solitons, making them more resilient to tidal disruption than their N-body counterparts. Our results demonstrate GAMER-2's capability to resolve non-linear FDM substructure down to z = 0, paving the way for future studies of larger FDM subhalo samples with heavier particle masses. The simulation code GAMER-2 and the simulation setup used in this work are available at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Parameter Estimate from Persistent Radio Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$) by combining fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their persistent radio sources (PRSs) through the observationally validated Yang relation, $ L_{\nu} \propto | \mathrm{RM} | $, which links PRS luminosity to the rotation measure (RM) of the associated FRB. Using a mock sample of PRSs, we demonstrate that the Yang relation can help to unravel the degeneracies among $H_0$, baryon density parameter $\Omega_b$, and baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ in the traditional approach of using dispersion measure only to perform cosmological analyses. Our method employs a two-stage Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain $H_0$. Using the available data of six observed PRS systems, we obtain a preliminary constraint of $H_0 = 75 \pm 30~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We briefly discuss possible refinements of the method by reducing residual degeneracies and systematic uncertainties using future data and physical modeling. Our results indicate that the Yang relation can potentially become a new probe for performing FRB cosmology.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the scalaron dark matter in $f (R)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $f(R)$ gravity, the scalaron -- a scalar degree of freedom arising from modification of General Relativity -- could account for all dark matter in the universe if its mass lies in the meV--MeV range. In this work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model particles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we provide a detailed calculation of the scalaron's decay rate into two photons -- a one-loop process of significant interest that has been the subject of discrepancies in the literature. We demonstrate that a direct evaluation of loop diagrams with appropriate regularisation eliminates the ambiguities inherent in methods relying on Jacobians from field redefinitions. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of dark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation produced by its decays into photons. We also estimate the contribution of primordial scalarons emitted in the hot early universe to the present dark matter density and find it to be negligible. Our results support all key aspects of the original scenario, in which scalaron dark matter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Xu \&amp; Jing reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass $M_h$ and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the S\'ersic index $n$, at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of $11.3 &lt; \log M_*/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 11.7$, using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on $n$, we confirm a positive correlation between $n$ and $M_h$, and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of $n$ and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between $M_h$ and $n$. Furthermore, using SIMBA simulations with different feedback mode, we find jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback might be related to the relationship of S\'ersic index and halo mass.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and general relativity (GR) in upper secondary school through new targeted teaching materials: a study on student learning and motivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmology and GR remain largely inaccessible to high-school teaching due to the advanced prerequisites to master these topics. Integrating them into upper secondary teaching is a significant challenge that remains unresolved. This contribution reports on an implementation study of a GR and cosmology course for upper secondary school students as part of an educational project launched during the centenary of GR and tested ever since for several years. The course aimed to expand students' knowledge to include current physics topics while highlighting their foundations in areas of classical physics such as Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, and waves. Targeted teaching and learning materials are focused on conceptual and qualitative understanding, while systematically combined with a mathematical treatment accessible at the upper secondary level, avoiding oversimplification. A key element is an active learning approach, incorporating activities and tasks such as engaging applications related to current research, reflective exercises, thought experiments, and hands-on tasks. The main research objective was to explore whether a conceptually deep and educationally effective GR and cosmology course could be successfully implemented for non-specialist upper secondary students. A pre-post study assessed both conceptual learning and affective outcomes, including interest, curiosity, self-concept, and perceived relevance of science. Results showed encouraging gains in both learning and motivation, with large to very large effect sizes for conceptual learning of core principles. Additionally, no or small effects of predictors such as gender were observed. We conclude that the integration of GR and cosmology into upper secondary physics teaching, in the form of courses and materials that are engaging, comprehensible, and impactful, is feasible.</description>

      <title>Black-box unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo are state-of-the-art methods for taking samples from high-dimensional distributions with a differentiable density function. To generate samples, they numerically integrate Hamiltonian or Langevin dynamics. This numerical integration introduces an asymptotic bias in Monte Carlo estimators of expectation values, which can be eliminated by adjusting the dynamics with a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) proposal step. Alternatively, one can trade bias for variance by avoiding MH, and select an integration step size that ensures sufficiently small asymptotic bias, relative to the variance inherent in a finite set of samples. Such unadjusted methods often significantly outperform their adjusted counterparts in high-dimensional problems where sampling would otherwise be prohibitively expensive, yet are rarely used in statistical applications due to the absence of an automated way of choosing a step size. We propose just such an automatic tuning scheme that takes a user-provided asymptotic bias tolerance and selects a step size that ensures it. The key to the method is a relationship we establish between the energy error in the integration and asymptotic bias. For Gaussians, we show that this procedure rigorously bounds the asymptotic bias. We then numerically show that the procedure works beyond Gaussians, on typical Bayesian problems. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed scheme, we provide a comprehensive comparison of adjusted and unadjusted samplers, showing that with our tuning scheme, the unadjusted methods achieve close to optimal performance and significantly and consistently outperform their adjusted counterparts.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential Primordial Black Hole Production via Delayed Vacuum Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly, delayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here we consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced black holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, using both numerical and analytical arguments and methods, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a double, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean action over temperature at its minimal value. We show that a modified expansion rate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy density component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model parameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that our findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed vacuum decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inert doublet model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM), provides a scalar dark matter (DM) candidate that belongs to the additional Higgs doublet. The model faces challenges in achieving the correct relic abundance for compressed spectra and DM masses in the high-mass range. In this work we introduce a $Z_2$-odd singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) into the IDM framework that helps us alleviate these issues and provide new channels of contributions to the relic abundance. The VLQ not only enhances the DM relic abundance for masses above $~550$ GeV but also eases constraints from direct detection experiments by enabling smaller couplings between the inert scalars and the SM Higgs. We analyze the impact of the VLQ on DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection constraints. The results demonstrate that the extended IDM framework not only resolves existing limitations in the compressed spectrum but also offers exciting prospects for detection in current and future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia Data Release 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial component $v_r$ is developed to measure the gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for the high-acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that a gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Strong backreaction of gauge quanta produced during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During inflation an axion field coupled to a gauge field through a Chern-Simons term can trigger the production of gauge quanta due to a tachyonic instability. The amplification of the gauge field modes exponentially depends on the velocity of the axion field, which in turn slows down the rolling of the axion field when backreaction is taken into account. To illustrate how the strength of the Chern-Simons coupling and the slope of the axion potential influence the particle production, in this paper we consider a toy model in which the axion field is a spectator with a linear potential. In the strong backreaction regime, the energy density of the gauge field quasiperiodically oscillates. The steep slope of the axion potential linearly increases the peak amplitude of the energy density while the strong coupling linearly decreases the peak amplitude. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>A strike of luck: could the KM3-230213A event be caused by an evaporating primordial black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the "memory burden", may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT's current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.</description>
