      <title>Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars for Web, Mobile and VR Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars, a real-time and cross-platform 3D avatar system. Many approaches have been proposed to animate Gaussian Splatting, but they often require camera arrays, long preprocessing times, or high-end GPUs. Some methods attempt to convert Gaussian Splatting into mesh-based representations, achieving lightweight performance but sacrificing visual fidelity. In contrast, our system efficiently animates Gaussian Splatting by leveraging parallel splat-wise processing to dynamically follow the underlying skinned mesh in real time while preserving high visual fidelity. From smartphone-based 3D scanning to on-device preprocessing, the entire process takes just around five minutes, with the avatar generation step itself completed in only about 30 seconds. Our system enables users to instantly transform their real-world appearance into a 3D avatar, making it ideal for seamless integration with social media and metaverse applications.

      <title>Distributed-Memory Parallel Algorithms for Fixed-Radius Near Neighbor Graph Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing fixed-radius near-neighbor graphs is an important first step for many data analysis algorithms. Near-neighbor graphs connect points that are close under some metric, endowing point clouds with a combinatorial structure. As computing power and data acquisition methods advance, diverse sources of large scientific datasets would greatly benefit from scalable solutions to this common subroutine for downstream analysis. Prior work on parallel nearest neighbors has made great progress in problems like k-nearest and approximate nearest neighbor search problems, with particular attention on Euclidean spaces. Yet many applications need exact solutions and non-Euclidean metrics. This paper presents a scalable sparsity-aware distributed memory algorithm using cover trees to compute near-neighbor graphs in general metric spaces. We provide a shared-memory algorithm for cover tree construction and demonstrate its competitiveness with state-of-the-art fixed-radius search data structures. We then introduce two distributed-memory algorithms for the near-neighbor graph problem, a simple point-partitioning strategy and a spatial-partitioning strategy, which leverage the cover tree algorithm on each node. Our algorithms exhibit parallel scaling across a variety of real and synthetic datasets for both traditional and non-traditional metrics. On real world high dimensional datasets with one million points, we achieve speedups up to 678.34x over the state-of-the-art using 1024 cores for graphs with 70 neighbors per vertex (on average), and up to 1590.99x using 4096 cores for graphs with 500 neighbors per vertex (on average).</description>

      <title>Excluding $K_{2,t}$ as a fat minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, the graph $K_{2,t}$ satisfies the fat minor conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu: for every $K\in \mathbb{N}$ there exist $M,A\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph with no $K$-fat $K_{2,t}$ minor is $(M,A)$-quasi-isometric to a graph with no $K_{2,t}$ minor. We use this to obtain an efficient algorithm for approximating the minimal multiplicative distortion of any embedding of a finite graph into a $K_{2,t}$-minor-free graph, answering a question of Chepoi, Dragan, Newman, Rabinovich, and Vax\`es from 2012.</description>

      <title>An $(\aleph_0,k+2)$-Theorem for $k$-Transversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{F}$ of sets satisfies the $(p,q)$-property if among every $p$ members of $\mathcal{F}$, some $q$ can be pierced by a single point. The celebrated $(p,q)$-theorem of Alon and Kleitman asserts that for any $p \geq q \geq d+1$, any family $\mathcal{F}$ of compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that satisfies the $(p,q)$-property can be pierced by a finite number $c(p,q,d)$ of points. A similar theorem with respect to piercing by $(d-1)$-dimensional flats, called $(d-1)$-transversals, was obtained by Alon and Kalai.
  In this paper we prove the following result, which can be viewed as an $(\aleph_0,k+2)$-theorem with respect to $k$-transversals: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be an infinite family of closed balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and let $0 \leq k &lt; d$. If among every $\aleph_0$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$, some $k+2$ can be pierced by a $k$-dimensional flat, then $\mathcal{F}$ can be pierced by a finite number of $k$-dimensional flats. We derive this result as a corollary of a more general result which proves the same assertion for families of not necessarily convex objects called \emph{near-balls}, to be defined below.
  This is the first $(p,q)$-theorem in which the assumption is weakened to an $(\infty,\cdot)$ assumption. Our proofs combine geometric and topological tools.</description>

      <title>Stochastic and incremental subgradient methods for convex optimization on Hadamard spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a foundation for optimization, convexity is useful beyond the classical settings of Euclidean and Hilbert space. The broader arena of nonpositively curved metric spaces, which includes manifolds like hyperbolic space, as well as metric trees and more general CAT(0) cubical complexes, supports primal tools like proximal operations for geodesically convex functions. However, the lack of linear structure in such spaces complicates dual constructions like subgradients. To address this hurdle, we introduce a new type of subgradient for functions on Hadamard spaces, based on Busemann functions. Our notion supports generalizations of classical stochastic and incremental subgradient methods, with guaranteed complexity bounds. We illustrate with subgradient algorithms for $p$-mean problems in general Hadamard spaces, in particular computing medians in BHV tree space.</description>
