      <title>Asymptotic expansions for the reciprocal Hardy-Littlewood logarithmic integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defining a family of recurrences, we generalize Comtet's formula for the generating function of the enumeration of indecomposable permutations. Consequently, we generalize Panaitopol's asymptotic expansion for the prime counting function, obtaining asymptotic expansions salient to the first Hardy-Littlewood conjecture.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-type identities through collocation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broader framework for the Cauchy identity derived from the determinant expansion of collocation matrices. This approach yields an infinite family of identities, where the original Cauchy identity stands as a particular case. To illustrate the versatility and depth of this approach, we provide a range of compelling examples, showcasing the connections and applications of these novel identities.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Subgraphs of Prime Order Element Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study different forbidden subgraph characterizations of the prime-order element graph $\Gamma(G)$ defined on a finite group $G$. Its set of vertices is the group $G$ and two vertices $x,y \in G$ are adjacent if the order of $xy$ is prime. More specifically, we investigate the conditions when $\Gamma(G)$ is perfect, cograph, chordal, claw-free, and interval graph.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq (1/2+\varepsilon)n$ is spanned by a complete blow-up of a cycle with clusters of quasi uniform size $\Omega(\log n)$. The proof is based on a recently introduced approach for finding vertex-spanning substructures via blow-up covers.</description>

Abstract: Gosper developed algorithms for adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing two continued fractions, and for solving quadratics with CF coefficients, getting a CF as the result. Here we present modified versions of those algorithms which avoid all difficulties with infinite loops. We have implemented these algorithms in Haskell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate reciprocals of false theta functions, producing results such as congruences, simple asymptotic bounds, and combinatorial identities. Of particular interest is a connection between $1/\Psi(-q^2,q)$ and the truncated pentagonal number theorem of Andrews and Merca. We record a useful dissection identity analogous to the known theta function dissection.</description>

      <title>Colouring signed Kneser, Schrijver, and Borsuk graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signed Kneser graph $SK(n,k)$, $k\leq n$, is the graph whose vertices are signed $k$-subsets of $[n]$ (i.e. $k$-subsets $S$ of $\{ \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots, \pm n\}$ such that $S\cap -S=\emptyset$). Two vertices $A$ and $B$ are adjacent with a positive edge if $A\cap -B=\emptyset$ and with a negative edge if $A\cap B=\emptyset$. We prove that the balanced chromatic number of $SK(n,k)$ is $n-k+1$. We then introduce the signed analogue of Schrijver graphs and show that they form vertex-critical subgraphs of $SK(n,k)$ with respect to balanced colouring. Further connection to topological methods, in particular, connection to signed Borsuk graphs is also considered.</description>

Abstract: We provide a criterion to distinguish two graphs which are indistinguishable by $2$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm for almost all graphs. Haemers conjectured that almost all graphs are identified by their spectrum. Our approach suggests that almost all graphs are identified by their generalized block Laplacian spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Chen, He, Hu and Xie considered the number of non-overlined (resp. overlined) parts of size greater than or equal to the size of the smallest overlined (resp. non-overlined) part in an overpartition. In this article, we will study the remaining four cases. Furthermore, we will investigate the number of non-overlined (resp. overlined) parts of size less than or equal to the size of the largest overlined (resp. non-overlined) part in an overpartition.</description>

      <title>The Gamma-Theta Conjecture holds for planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-Theta Conjecture states that if the domination number of a graph is equal to its eternal domination number, then it is also equal to its clique covering number. This conjecture is known to be true for several graph classes, such as outerplanar graphs, subcubic graphs and $C_k$-free graphs, where $k \in \{3,4\}$. In this paper, we prove the Conjecture for the class of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Bounding Klarner's constant from above using a simple recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Klarner and Rivest showed that the growth of the number of polyominoes, also known as Klarner's constant, is at most $2+2\sqrt{2}&lt;4.83$ by viewing polyominoes as a sequence of twigs with appropriate weights given to each twig and studying the corresponding multivariate generating function. In this short note, we give a simpler proof by a recurrence on an upper bound. In particular, we show that the number of polyominoes with $n$ cells is at most $G(n)$ with $G(0)=G(1)=1$ and for $n\ge 2$, \[
  G(n) = 2\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} G(m)G(n-1-m). \] It should be noted that $G(n)$ has multiple combinatorial interpretations in literature.</description>

      <title>An improved bound on Seymour's second neighborhood conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seymour's celebrated second neighborhood conjecture, now more than thirty years old, states that in every oriented digraph, there is a vertex $u$ such that the size of its second out-neighborhood $N^{++}(u)$ is at least as large as that of its first out-neighborhood $N^+(u)$. In this paper, we prove the existence of $u$ for which $|N^{++}(u)| \ge 0.715538 |N^+(u)|$. This result provides the first improvement to the best known constant factor in over two decades.</description>

      <title>A note on the structure of locally finite planar quasi-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an early work from 1896, Maschke established the complete list of all finite planar Cayley graphs. This result initiated a long line of research over the next century, aiming at characterizing in a similar way all planar infinite Cayley graphs. Droms (2006) proved a structure theorem for finitely generated planar groups, i.e., finitely generated groups admitting a planar Cayley graph, in terms of Bass-Serre decompositions. As a byproduct of his structure theorem, Droms proved that such groups are finitely presented. More recently, Hamann (2018) gave a graph theoretical proof that every planar quasi-transitive graph $G$ admits a generating $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$-invariant set of closed walks with only finitely many orbits, and showed that a consequence is an alternative proof of Droms' result. Based on the work of Hamann, we show in this note that we can also obtain a general structure theorem for $3$-connected locally finite planar quasi-transitive graphs, namely that every such graph admits a canonical tree-decomposition whose edge-separations correspond to cycle-separations in the (unique) embedding of $G$, and in which every part admits a vertex-accumulation free embedding. This result can be seen as a version of Droms' structure theorem for quasi-transitive planar graphs. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative proof of a result of Hamann, Lehner, Miraftab and R\"uhmann (2022) that every locally finite quasi-transitive planar graph admits a canonical tree-decomposition, whose parts are either $1$-ended or finite planar graphs.</description>

      <title>The smallest normalized signless $\infty$-Laplacian eigenvalue for non-bipartite connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the smallest normalized signless $\infty$-Laplacian eigenvalue $\mu_{\infty}$, a generalisation of the smallest signless Laplacian eigenvalue. For a non-bipartite connected graph, we show that the invariant $\mu_{\infty}$ equals to the reciprocal of the minimal $\infty$-norm of the generalized inverses of the weighted signless incidence matrix. An example is also given to illustrate the result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct two infinite families of graphs $G(d,c)$ and $G^+(d,c)$, where, in both cases, a vertex label is $x_1x_2\ldots x_c$ with $x_i\in\{1,2,\ldots, d\}$. We provide a lower bound on the metric dimension, tight on $G^+(d,c)$. Moreover, we give the definition and properties of the supertoken graphs, a generalization of the well-known token graphs. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the metric dimension of supertoken graphs.</description>

      <title>Some Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Diophantine Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear Diophantine equation $ax + by = n$ is solvable if and only if gcd$(a; b)$ divides $n$. A graph $G$ of order $n$ is called Diophantine if there exists a labeling function $f$ of vertices such that gcd$(f(u); f(v))$ divides $n$ for every two adjacent vertices $u; v$ in $G$. In this work, maximal Diophantine graphs on $n$ vertices, $D_n$, are defined, studied and generalized. The independence number, the number of vertices with full degree and the clique number of $D_n$ are computed. Each of these quantities is the basis of a necessary condition for the existence of such a labeling.</description>

      <title>Tableau formula for vexillary double Edelman--Greene coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lam, Lee and Shimozono recently introduced backstable double Grothendieck polynomials to represent $K$-theory classes of the infinite flag variety. They used them to define double $\beta$-Stanley symmetric functions, which expand into double stable Grothendieck functions with polynomial coefficients called double $\beta$-Edelman--Greene coefficients. Anderson proved these coefficients are $\beta$-Graham positive. For vexillary permutations, this is equivalent to a statement for skew flagged double $\beta$-Grothendieck functions. Working in this setting, we give a tableau formula for vexillary double $\beta$-Edelman--Greene coefficients that is manifestly $\beta$-Graham positive. Our formula demonstrates a finer notion of positivity than was previously known.</description>

      <title>From order one catalytic decompositions to context-free specifications, bijectively</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Bousquet-M\'elou and Jehanne states that the bivariate power series solutions of so-called combinatorial polynomial equations with one catalytic variable (or catalytic equations) are algebraic series. We give a purely combinatorial derivation of this result in the case of order one catalytic equations (those involving only one univariate unknown series). In particular our approach provides a tool to produce context-free specifications or bijections with simple multi-type families of trees for the derivation trees of combinatorial structures that are directly governed by an order one catalytic decomposition.
  This provides a simple unified framework to deal with various combinatorial interpretation problems that were solved or raised over the last 50 years since the first such catalytic equation was written by W.T. Tutte in the late 60's to enumerate rooted planar maps.</description>

      <title>On Discrete Curvatures of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several interweaving notions of discrete curvature on graphs. Many approaches utilize the optimal transportation metric on its probability simplex or the distance matrix of the graph. Since each of these ingredients is well understood when the underlying graph is a tree, in this note, we review existing and obtain new formulas for three different types of curvature on graphs. Along the way we obtain: a comparison result for the curvatures under consideration, a degree-diameter theorem for trees, and a combinatorial identity for certain sums of distances on trees.</description>

      <title>There are finitely many uniformly most reliable graphs of corank 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $G$ is a simple graph and $\rho\in[0,1]$, the reliability $R_G(\rho)$ is the probability of $G$ being connected after each of its edges is removed independently with probability $\rho$. A simple graph $G$ is a \emph{uniformly most reliable graph} (UMRG) if $R_G(\rho)\geq R_H(\rho)$ for every $\rho\in[0,1]$ and every simple graph $H$ on the same number of vertices and edges as $G$. Boesch [J.\ Graph Theory 10 (1986), 339--352] conjectured that, if $n$ and $m$ are such that there exists a connected simple graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, then there also exists a UMRG on the same number of vertices and edges. Some counterexamples to Boesch's conjecture were given by Kelmans, Myrvold et al., and Brown and Cox. It is known that Boesch's conjecture holds whenever the corank, defined as $c=m-n+1$, is at most $4$ (and the corresponding UMRGs are fully characterized). Ath and Sobel conjectured that Boesch's conjecture holds whenever the corank $c$ is between $5$ and $8$, provided the number of vertices is at least $2c-2$. In this work, we give an infinite family of counterexamples to Boesch's conjecture of corank $5$. These are the first reported counterexamples that attain the minimum possible corank. As a byproduct, the conjecture by Ath and Sobel is disproved.</description>

      <title>An algebraic characterization of strong graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected simple graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Denote $N_{i}^{(j)}(G)$ the number of spanning subgraphs of $G$ having precisely $i$ edges and not more than $j$ connected components. The graph $G$ is \emph{strong} if $N_{i}^{j}(G)\geq N_{i}^{j}(H)$ for each pair of integers $i\in \{0,1,\ldots,m\}$ and $j\in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and each connected simple graph $H$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The graph $G$ is \emph{Whitney-maximum} if for each connected simple graph $H$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges there exists a polynomial $P_H(x,y)$ with nonnegative coefficients such that $W_{G}(x,y)-W_H(x,y)=(1-xy)P_H(x,y)$, where $W_G$ and $W_H$ stand for the Whitney polynomial of $G$ and $H$. In this work it is proved that a graph is strong if and only if it is Whitney-maximum. Consequently, the $0$-element conjecture proposed by Boesch [J.\ Graph Theory 10 (1986), 339--352] is true when restricted to graph classes in which Whitney-maximum graphs exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey accompanies a lecture on the paper ``Interlacing Families I: Bipartite Ramanujan Graphs of All Degrees'' by A. Marcus, D. Spielman, and N. Srivastava at the 2024 International Congress of Basic Science (ICBS) in July, 2024. Its purpose is to explain the developments surrounding this work over the past ten or so years, with an emphasis on connections to other areas of mathematics. Earlier surveys about the interlacing families method by the same authors focused on applications in functional analysis, whereas the focus here is on applications in spectral graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is a $n$-vertex connected chordal graph, then it admits a longest path transversal of size $O(\log^2 n)$. Under the stronger assumption of 2-connectivity, we show $G$ admits a longest cycle transversal of size $O(\log n)$. We also provide longest path and longest cycle transversals which are bounded by the leafage of the chordal graph.</description>

      <title>Simple Quantum Coins Enable Pretty Good State Transfer on Every Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider pretty good state transfer in coined quantum walks between antipodal vertices on the hypercube $Q_d$. When $d$ is a prime, this was proven to occur in the arc-reversal walk with Grover coins. We extend this result by constructing weighted Grover coins that enable pretty good state transfer on every $Q_d$. Our coins are real, and require modification of the weight on only one arc per vertex. We also generalize our approach and establish a sufficient condition for pretty good state transfer to occur on other graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities extend the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials to a broader range of Lie types. In this work, we investigate these multiplicities through the framework of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. Specifically, for type $C$ with dominant weights and type $B$ with dominant spin weights, we present a combinatorial formula for Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities in terms of energy functions of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals, generalizing the charge statistic on semistandard Young tableaux for type $A$. Additionally, we introduce level-restricted $q$-weight multiplicities for nonexceptional types, and prove positivity by providing their combinatorial formulas.</description>

      <title>On Cospectral Nonisomorphic Graphs and Graphs Determined by Their Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of cospectral non-isomorphic graphs and graphs that are determined by their spectrum is a fascinating area of research in spectral graph theory and algebraic combinatorics. This field focuses on examining various classes of graphs, devising methods to distinguish cospectral and non-isomorphic graphs, and analyzing the conditions under which a graph's spectrum uniquely determines its structure. This paper presents an overview of both classical and recent advancements in these topics, along with some newly obtained results by the authors.</description>

      <title>Truncated degree AT-orientations of outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An AT-orientation of a graph $G$ is an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that the number of even Eulerian sub-digraphs and the number of odd Eulerian sub-digraphs of $D$ are distinct. Given a mapping $f: V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$, we say $G$ is $f$-AT if $G$ has an AT-orientation $D$ with $ &lt; f(v)$ for each vertex $v$. For a positive integer $k$, we say $G$ is $k$-truncated degree-AT if $G$ is $f$-AT for the mapping $f$ defined as $f(v) = \min #{k, d_G(v)#} $. This paper proves that 2-connected outerplanar graphs other than odd cycles are $5$-truncated degree-AT, and 2-connected bipartite outerplanar graphs are $4$-truncated degree-AT. As a consequence, 2-connected outerplanar graphs other than odd cycles are $5$-truncated degree paintable, and 2-connected bipartite outerplanar graphs are $4$-truncated degree paintable.
  This improves the result of Hutchinson in [On list-coloring outerplanar graphs], where it was proved that maximal 2-connected outerplanar graphs other than are 5-truncated degree-choosable, and 2-connected bipartite outerplanar graphs are 4-truncated degree-choosable.</description>

Abstract: We describe all the Bier spheres of dimension $d$ with chromatic number equal to $d+1$ and prove that all other $d$-dimensional Bier spheres have chromatic number equal to $d+2$, for any integer $d\geq 0$. Then we prove a general formula for complex and mod $p$ Buchstaber numbers of a Bier sphere $\mathrm{Bier}(K)$, for each prime $p\in\mathbb N$ in terms of the $f$-vector of the underlying simplicial complex $K$. Finally, we classify all chordal Bier spheres and obtain their canonical realizations as boundaries of stacked polytopes.</description>

      <title>Bound on shortest cycle covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume $G$ is a bridgeless graph. A cycle cover of $G$ is a collection of cycles of $G$ such that each edge of $G$ is contained in at least one of the cycles. The length of a cycle cover of $G$ is the sum of the lengths of the cycles in the cover. The minimum length of a cycle cover of $G$ is denoted by $cc(G)$. It was proved independently by Alon and Tarsi and by Bermond, Jackson, and Jaeger that $cc(G)\le \frac{5}{3}m$ for every bridgeless graph $G$ with $m$ edges. This remained the best-known upper bound for $cc(G)$ for 40 years. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is a bridgeless graph with $m$ edges and $n_2$ vertices of degree $2$, then $cc(G) &lt; \frac{29}{18}m+ \frac 1{18}n_2$. As a consequence, we show that $cc(G) \le \frac 53 m - \frac 1{42} \log m$. The upper bound $ cc(G) &lt; \frac{29}{18}m \approx 1.6111 m$ for bridgeless graphs $G$ of minimum degree at least 3 improves the previous known upper bound $1.6258m$. A key lemma used in the proof confirms Fan's conjecture that if $C$ is a circuit of $G$ and $G/C$ admits a nowhere zero 4-flow, then $G$ admits a 4-flow $f$ such that $E(G)-E(C)\subseteq \text{supp} (f)$ and $|\textrm{supp}(f)\cap E(C)|&gt;\frac{3}{4}|E(C)|$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation process on the graph with vertex set $V=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1,2,\dots,k$, where $k\ge 2$. We find asymptotics of the critical probability of percolation for $r=2,3$. In the deterministic setting, we obtain several results for the size of the smallest percolating set for $k\ge 2$, including the exact values for $k=2$ and $2\le r\le 6$.</description>

      <title>The Tur\'an density of the tight 5-cycle minus one edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let the tight $\ell$-cycle minus one edge $C_\ell^{3-}$ be the $3$-graph on $\{1,\dots,\ell\}$ consisting of $\ell-1$ consecutive triples in the cyclic order. We show that, for every $\ell\ge 5$ not divisible by $3$, the Tur\'an density of $C_{\ell}^{3-}$ is $1/4$ and also prove some finer structure results. This proves a conjecture of Mubayi--Sudakov--Pikhurko from 2011 and extends the results of Balogh--Luo [Combinatorica 44 (2024) 949--976] who established analogous claims for all sufficiently large $\ell$.
  Results similar to ours were independently obtained by Lidick\'y--Mattes--Pfender [arXiv:2409.14257].</description>

      <title>On the Algebraic Connectivity of Token Graphs and Graphs under Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices and an integer $k$ between 1 and $n-1$, the $k$-token graph $F_k(G)$ has vertices representing the $k$-subsets of $V$, and two vertices are adjacent if their symmetric difference is the two end-vertices of an edge in $E$. Using the theory of Markov chains of random walks and the interchange process, it was proved that the algebraic connectivities (second smallest Laplacian eigenvalues) of $G$ and $F_k(G)$ coincide, but a combinatorial/algebraic proof has been shown elusive. In this paper, we use the latter approach and prove that such equality holds for different new classes of graphs under perturbations, such as extended cycles, extended complete bipartite graphs, kite graphs, and graphs with a cut clique. Kite graphs are formed by a graph (head) with several paths (tail) rooted at the same vertex and with exciting properties. For instance, we show that the different eigenvalues of a kite graph are also eigenvalues of its perturbed graph obtained by adding edges. Moreover, as a particular case of one of our theorems, we generalize a recent result of Barik and Verma \cite{bv24} about graphs with a cut vertex of degree $n-1$. Along the way, we give conditions under which the perturbed graph $G+uv$, with $uv\in E$, has the same algebraic connectivity as $G$.</description>

Abstract: I will show that there exist two binary words (one of length 4 and one of length 6) that play a special role in many different problems in combinatorics on words. They can therefore be considered \textit{the shortest interesting binary words}. My claim is supported by the fact that these two words appear in dozens of papers in combinatorics on words.</description>

      <title>On the clique number of random Cayley graphs and related topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a random Cayley graph on a group of order $N$ has clique number $O(\log N \log \log N)$ with high probability. This bound is best possible up to the constant factor for certain groups, including~$\mathbb{F}_2^n$, and improves the longstanding upper bound of $O(\log^2 N)$ due to Alon. Our proof does not make use of the underlying group structure and is purely combinatorial, with the key result being an essentially best possible upper bound for the number of subsets of given order that contain at most a given number of colors in a properly edge-colored complete graph. As a further application of this result, we study a conjecture of Alon stating that every group of order $N$ has a Cayley graph whose clique number and independence number are both $O(\log N)$, proving the conjecture for all abelian groups of order $N$ for almost all $N$. For finite vector spaces of order $N$ with characteristic congruent to $1 \pmod 4$, we prove the existence of a self-complementary Cayley graph on the vector space whose clique number and independence number are both at most $(2+o(1))\log N$. This matches the lower bound for Ramsey numbers coming from random graphs and solves, in a strong form, a problem of Alon and Orlitsky motivated by information theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop some model theory of multi-linear forms, generalizing Granger in the bi-linear case. In particular, after proving a quantifier elimination result, we show that for an NIP field K, the theory of infinite dimensional non-degenerate alternating n-linear spaces over K is strictly n-dependent; and it is NSOP1 if K is. This relies on a new Composition Lemma for functions of arbitrary arity and NIP relations (which in turn relies on certain higher arity generalizations of Sauer-Shelah lemma). We also study the invariant connected components $G^{\infty}$ in n-dependent groups, demonstrating their relative absoluteness in the abelian case.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by applications in medical bioinformatics, Khayatian et al. (2024) introduced a family of metrics on Cayley trees (the $k$-RF distance, for $k=0, \ldots, n-2$) and explored their distribution on pairs of random Cayley trees via simulations. In this paper, we investigate this distribution mathematically, and derive exact asymptotic descriptions of the distribution of the $k$-RF metric for the extreme values $k=0$ and $k=n-2$, as $n$ becomes large. We show that a linear transform of the $0$-RF metric converges to a Poisson distribution (with mean 2) whereas a similar transform for the $(n-2)$-RF metric leads to a normal distribution (with mean $\sim ne^{-2}$). These results (together with the case $k=1$ which behaves quite differently, and $k=n-3$) shed light on the earlier simulation results, and the predictions made concerning them.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan Property and Edge Universality of Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the normalized adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with any fixed degree $d\geq 3$ and denote its eigenvalues as $\lambda_1=d/\sqrt{d-1}\geq \lambda_2\geq\lambda_3\cdots\geq \lambda_N$. We establish the following two results as $N\rightarrow \infty$. (i) With high probability, all eigenvalues are optimally rigid, up to an additional $N^{{\rm o}(1)}$ factor. Specifically, the fluctuations of bulk eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-1+{\rm o}(1)}$, and the fluctuations of edge eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-2/3+{\rm o}(1)}$. (ii) Edge universality holds for random $d$-regular graphs. That is, the distributions of $\lambda_2$ and $-\lambda_N$ converge to the Tracy-Widom$_1$ distribution associated with the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. As a consequence, for sufficiently large $N$, approximately $69\%$ of $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices are Ramanujan, meaning $\max\{\lambda_2,|\lambda_N|\}\leq 2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $P_n$ be a random Bernoulli excursion of length $2n$. We show that the area under $P_n$ and the number of peaks of $P_n$ are asymptotically independent. We also show that these statistics have the correlation coefficient asymptotic to $c /\sqrt{n}$ for large $n$, where $c &lt; 0$, and explicitly compute the coefficient $c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study combinatorial and asymptotic properties of some interesting rational numbers called the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten (BGW) numbers, which can be represented as the intersection numbers of psi and Theta classes on the moduli space of stable algebraic curves. In particular, we discover and prove the uniform large genus asymptotics of certain normalized BGW numbers, and give a new proof of the polynomiality phenomenon for the large genus. We also propose several new conjectures including monotonicity and integrality on the BGW numbers. Applications to the Painlev\'e II hierarchy and to the BGW-kappa numbers are given.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Polynomials of Elements in Symmetric and Alternating Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $ (\rho, V) $ be an irreducible representation of the symmetric group $ S_n$ (or the alternating group $ A_n$), and let $ g $ be a permutation on $n$ letters with each of its cycle lengths divides the length of its largest cycle. We describe completely the minimal polynomial of $\rho(g)$, showing that, in most cases, it equals $x^{o(g)} - 1 $, with a few explicit exceptions. As a by-product, we obtain a new proof (using only combinatorics and representation theory) of a theorem of Swanson that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a standard Young tableau of a given shape and major index $r \ \text{mod} \ n$, for all $r$. Thereby, we give a new proof of a celebrated result of Klyachko on Lie elements in a tensor algebra, and of a conjecture of Sundaram on the existence of an invariant vector for $n$-cycles. We also show that for elements $g$ in $S_n$ or $A_n$ of even order, in most cases, $\rho(g)$ has eigenvalue $-1$, with a few explicit exceptions.</description>

      <title>The homological shift algebra of a monomial ideal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $K$, and let $I\subset S$ be a monomial ideal. In this paper, we introduce the $i$th homological shift algebras $\text{HS}_i(\mathcal{R}(I))=S\oplus\bigoplus_{k\ge1}\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ of $I$. These algebras have the structure of a finitely generated bigraded module over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I)$ of $I$. Hence, many invariants of $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$, such as depth, associated primes, regularity, and the $\text{v}$-number, exhibit well behaved asymptotic behavior. We particularly investigate $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ when $I$ has linear powers, and determine several families of monomial ideals $I$ for which $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ has linear resolution for all $k\gg0$. Finally, we show that $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ is Golod for all monomial ideals $I\subset S$ and all $k\gg0$.</description>

      <title>Random Fibonacci Words via Clone Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate positivity and probabilistic properties arising from the Young-Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$, a 1-differential poset on binary words composed of 1's and 2's (known as Fibonacci words). Building on Okada's theory of clone Schur functions (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 549-568), we introduce clone coherent measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ which give rise to random Fibonacci words of increasing length. Unlike coherent systems associated to classical Schur functions on the Young lattice of integer partitions, clone coherent measures are generally not extremal on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  Our first main result is a complete characterization of Fibonacci positive specializations - parameter sequences which yield positive clone Schur functions on $\mathbb{YF}$. We connect Fibonacci positivity with total positivity of tridiagonal matrices, Stieltjes moment sequences, and orthogonal polynomials in one variable from the ($q$-)Askey scheme.
  Our second family of results concerns the asymptotic behavior of random Fibonacci words derived from various Fibonacci positive specializations. We analyze several limiting regimes for specific examples, revealing stick-breaking-like processes (connected to GEM distributions), dependent stick-breaking processes of a new type, or discrete limits tied to the Martin boundary of the Young-Fibonacci lattice. Our stick-breaking-like scaling limits significantly extend the result of Gnedin-Kerov (Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 129 (2000), no. 3, 433-446) on asymptotics of the Plancherel measure on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  We also establish Cauchy-like identities for clone Schur functions (with the right-hand side given by a quadridiagonal determinant), and construct and analyze models of random permutations and involutions based on Fibonacci positive specializations and a version of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence for $\mathbb{YF}$.</description>

      <title>Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</description>

      <title>Low coordinate degree algorithms II: Categorical signals and generalized stochastic block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study when low coordinate degree functions (LCDF) -- linear combinations of functions depending on small subsets of entries of a vector -- can test for the presence of categorical structure, including community structure and generalizations thereof, in high-dimensional data. This complements the first paper of this series, which studied the power of LCDF in testing for continuous structure like real-valued signals perturbed by additive noise. We apply the tools developed there to a general form of stochastic block model (SBM), where a population is assigned random labels and every $p$-tuple of the population generates an observation according to an arbitrary probability measure associated to the $p$ labels of its members. We show that the performance of LCDF admits a unified analysis for this class of models. As applications, we prove tight lower bounds against LCDF (and therefore also against low degree polynomials) for nearly arbitrary graph and regular hypergraph SBMs, always matching suitable generalizations of the Kesten-Stigum threshold. We also prove tight lower bounds for group synchronization and abelian group sumset problems under the "truth-or-Haar" noise model, and use our technical results to give an improved analysis of Gaussian multi-frequency group synchronization. In most of these models, for some parameter settings our lower bounds give new evidence for conjectural statistical-to-computational gaps. Finally, interpreting some of our findings, we propose a precise analogy between categorical and continuous signals: a general SBM as above behaves, in terms of the tradeoff between subexponential runtime cost of testing algorithms and the signal strength needed for a testing algorithm to succeed, like a spiked $p_*$-tensor model of a certain order $p_*$ that may be computed from the parameters of the SBM.</description>

Abstract: We give a proof of the generalized Cauchy identity for double Grothendieck polynomials, a combinatorial interpretation of the stable double Grothendieck polynomials in terms of triples of tableaux, and an interpolation between the stable double Grothendieck polynomial and the weak stable double Grothendieck polynomial. This so-called half weak stable double Grothendieck polynomial evaluated at $x=y$ generalizes the type $B$ Stanley symmetric function of Billey and Haiman and is $Q$-Schur positive by degree. We conclude with two open problems as well as a conjecture regarding the $K$-theoretic analogues of factorial Schur $Q$-functions defined by Ikeda and Naruse. The conjecture is supported by code given in the appendices.</description>

      <title>On the construction of a family of sets of positive integers closed under taking subsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the several contexts such as combinatorial number theory, families of sets of positive integers closed under taking subsets have been investigated. Then it is sometimes useful to give bijections between the set of the one-sided infinite sequences on the alphabet set $\{0,1\}$ and such a family of sets. The most typical example is the family of sum-free sets. Although such a kind of families covers a large class of families of sets, there are only a few considerations on bijections for the case where the sum-free property is replaced by another property.
  In this paper, we explicitly give a bijection and its inverse between the set of one-sided infinite sequences on the alphabet set $\{0,1\}$ and a family of sets which may be contained in a class of families closed under taking subsets. Moreover, we show that some extremal property in a particular family of sets is characterized by a discrete dynamical system based on this kind of bijections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{ex}(n,s)$ denote the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices which contains no independent sets larger than $s$. The behaviour of $\mathrm{ex}(n,s)$ was first studied by Andr\'asfai, who conjectured that for $s&gt;n/3$ this function is determined by appropriately chosen blow-ups of so called Andr\'asfai graphs. Moreover, he proved $\mathrm{ex}(n, s)=n^2-4ns+5s^2$ for $s/n\in [2/5, 1/2]$ and in earlier work we obtained $\mathrm{ex}(n, s)=3n^2-15ns+20s^2$ for $s/n\in [3/8, 2/5]$. Here we make the next step in the quest to settle Andr\'asfai's conjecture by proving $\mathrm{ex}(n, s)=6n^2-32ns+44s^2$ for $s/n\in [4/11, 3/8]$.</description>

      <title>The minimum degree of minimal $k$-factor-critical claw-free graphs*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ of order $n$ is said to be $k$-factor-critical for integers $1\leq k&lt; n$, if the removal of any $k$ vertices results in a graph with a perfect matching. A $k$-factor-critical graph is minimal if for every edge, the deletion of it results in a graph that is not $k$-factor-critical. In 1998, O. Favaron and M. Shi conjectured that every minimal $k$-factor-critical graph has minimum degree $k+1$. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture for minimal $k$-factor-critical claw-free graphs. Moreover, we show that every minimal $k$-factor-critical claw-free graph $G$ has at least $\frac{k-1}{2k}|V(G)|$ vertices of degree $k+1$ in the case of $(k+1)$-connected, yielding further evidence for S. Norine and R. Thomas' conjecture on the minimum degree of minimal bricks when $k=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conditions under which a given hypergraph is randomly robust Hamiltonian, which means that a random sparsification of the host graph contains a Hamilton cycle with high probability. Our main contribution provides nearly optimal results whenever the host graph is Hamilton connected in a locally robust sense, which translates to a typical induced subgraph of constant order containing Hamilton paths between any pair of suitable ends.
  The proofs are based on the recent breakthrough on Talagrand's conjecture, which reduces the problem to specifying a distribution on the desired guest structure in the (deterministic) host structure. We find such a distribution via a new argument that reduces the problem to the case of perfect matchings in a higher uniformity.
  As applications, we obtain asymptotically optimal results for perfect tilings in graphs and hypergraphs both in the minimum degree and uniformly dense setting. We also prove random robustness for powers of cycles under asymptotically optimal minimum degrees and degree sequences. We solve the problem for loose and tight Hamilton cycles in hypergraphs under a range of asymptotic minimum degree conditions. This includes in particular $k$-uniform tight Hamilton cycles under minimum $d$-degree conditions for $1\leq k-d \leq 3$. In all cases, our bounds on the sparseness are essentially best-possible.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}$ be a matrix of $n \times n$ variables, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]$ be the polynomial ring on these variables. Let $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$ be the group of colored permutations, consisting of $n \times n$ complex matrices with exactly one nonzero entry in each row and column, where each nonzero entry is an $r$-th root of unity. We associate an ideal $I_{\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}} \subseteq \mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]$ with the group $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$, and use orbit harmonics to give an ideal-theoretic extension of the Viennot shadow line construction to $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$. This extension gives a standard monomial basis of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]/I_{\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}}$, and introduces an analogous definition of ``longest increasing subsequence'' to the group $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$. We examine the extension of Chen's conjecture to this analogy. We also study the structure of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]/I_{\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}}$ as a graded $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r} \times \mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$ module, which subsequently induces a graded $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r} \times \mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$ module structure on the $\mathbb{C}$-algebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}]$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic geometry of electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we relate a well-known in symplectic geometry compactification of the space of symmetric bilinear forms considered as a chart of the Lagrangian Grassmannian to the specific compactifications of the space of electrical networks in the disc obtained in \cite{L}, \cite{CGS} and \cite{BGKT}. In particular, we state an explicit connection between these works and describe some of the combinatorics developed there in the language of symplectic geometry. We also show that the combinatorics of the concordance vectors forces the uniqueness of the symplectic form, such that corresponding points of the Grassmannian are isotropic. We define a notion of Lagrangian concordance which provides a construction of the compactification of the space of electrical networks in the positive part of the Lagrangian Grassmannian bypassing the construction from \cite{L}.</description>

      <title>Hyper-bishops, Hyper-rooks, and Hyper-queens: Percentage of Safe Squares on Higher Dimensional Chess Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$ queens problem considers the maximum number of safe squares on an $n \times n$ chess board when placing $n$ queens; the answer is only known for small $n$. Miller, Sheng and Turek considered instead $n$ randomly placed rooks, proving the proportion of safe squares converges to $1/e^2$. We generalize and solve when randomly placing $n$ hyper-rooks and $n^{k-1}$ line-rooks on a $k$-dimensional board, using combinatorial and probabilistic methods, with the proportion of safe squares converging to $1/e^k$. We prove that the proportion of safe squares on an $n \times n$ board with bishops in 2 dimensions converges to $2/e^2$. This problem is significantly more interesting and difficult; while a rook attacks the same number of squares wherever it's placed, this is not so for bishops. We expand to the $k$-dimensional chessboard, defining line-bishops to attack along $2$-dimensional diagonals and hyper-bishops to attack in the $k-1$ dimensional subspace defined by its diagonals in the $k-2$ dimensional subspace. We then combine the movement of rooks and bishops to consider the movement of queens in 2 dimensions, as well as line-queens and hyper-queens in $k$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Multifold Convolutions, Generating Functions and 1d Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multifold convolutions of a combinatorial sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$: namely, for each $k \in \N$ the $k$-fold convolution is $\mathcal{M}^{(k)}_n(\boldsymbol{a}) = \sum_{j_1+\dots+j_k=n} a_{j_1} \cdots a_{j_k}$. Let $C_n$ be the Catalan numbers, and let $B_n$ be the central binomial coefficients. Then for random Dyck paths or simple random walk bridges, the multifold convolutions give moments of returns to the origin, using the stars-and-bars problem. There are well-known explicit formulas for the multifold convolutions of $C_n$ and $B_n$. But even for combinatorial sequences $B_n^2$ and $B_n^3$, one may determine asymptotics of multifold convolutions for large $n$. We also discuss large deviations: In a second part of the paper we consider an elementary version of the circle method for calculating asymptotics using complex analysis.</description>

Abstract: We give an operadic interpretation of the known result of L.Shapiro and A.B.Stephens that characterizes percolating permutation matrices. A relation of ideals and suboperads of the non-symmetric operad of permutations to percolative properties of sets in the 2-neighbor percolation process is discussed. On a related note, we discuss a certain presentation of the operad of permutations.</description>

      <title>Quantum chromatic numbers of some graphs in Hamming schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of quantum chromatic numbers of graphs is a hot research topic in recent years. However, the infinite family of graphs with known quantum chromatic numbers are rare, as far as we know, the only known such graphs (except for complete graphs, cycles, bipartite graphs and some trivial cases) are the Hadamard graphs $H_n$ with $2^n$ vertices and $n$ a multiple of $4$. In this paper, we consider the graphs in Hamming schemes, we determined the quantum chromatic numbers of one class of such graphs. Notably, this is the second known family of graphs whose quantum chromatic numbers are explicitly determined except for some cases aforementioned. We also provide some bounds for the quantum chromatic numbers of some other graphs in Hamming schemes. Consequently, we can obtain the quantum chromatic numbers of products of some graphs.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart Functions of Weighted Lattice Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies three different ways to assign weights to the lattice points of a convex polytope and discusses the algebraic and combinatorial properties of the resulting weighted Ehrhart functions and their generating functions and associated rings. These will be called $q$-weighted, $r$-weighted, and $s$-weighted Ehrhart functions, respectively. The key questions we investigate are \emph{When are the weighted Ehrhart series rational functions and which classical Ehrhart theory properties are preserved? And, when are the abstract formal power series the Hilbert series of Ehrhart rings of some polytope?} We prove generalizations about weighted Ehrhart $h^*$-coefficients of $q$-weighted Ehrhart series, and show $q$- and $s$-weighted Ehrhart reciprocity theorems. Then, we show the $q$- and $r$-weighted Ehrhart rings are the (classical) Ehrhart rings of weight lifting polytopes.</description>

      <title>Exponential Mixing Via Additive Combinatorics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the geodesic flow on a geometrically finite locally symmetric space of negative curvature is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. The approach is based on constructing a suitable anisotropic Banach space on which the infinitesimal generator of the flow admits an essential spectral gap. A key step in the proof involves estimating certain oscillatory integrals against the Patterson-Sullivan measure. For this purpose, we prove a general result of independent interest asserting that the Fourier transform of measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that do not concentrate near proper affine hyperplanes enjoy polynomial decay outside of a sparse set of frequencies. As an intermediate step, we show that the $L^q$-dimension ($1&lt;q\leq \infty$) of iterated self-convolutions of such measures tend towards that of the ambient space. Our analysis also yields that the Laplace transform of the correlation function of smooth observables extends meromorphically to the entire complex plane in the convex cocompact case and to a strip of explicit size beyond the imaginary axis in the case the manifold admits cusps.</description>

      <title>Infinite circle packings on surfaces with conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that given an infinite triangulation $K$ of a surface with punctures (i.e., with no vertices at the punctures) and a set of target cone angles smaller than $\pi$ at the punctures that satisfy a Gauss-Bonnet inequality, there exists a hyperbolic metric that has the prescribed angles and supports a circle packing in the combinatorics of $K$. Moreover, if $K$ is very symmetric, then we can identify the underlying Riemann surface and show that it does not depend on the angles. In particular, this provides examples of a triangulation $K$ and a conformal class $X$ such that there are infinitely many conical hyperbolic structures in the conformal class $X$ with a circle packing in the combinatorics of $K$. This is in sharp contrast with a conjecture of Kojima-Mizushima-Tan in the closed case.</description>

Abstract: In 2017, Igusa and Todorov gave a bijection between signed exceptional sequences and ordered partial clusters. In this paper, we show that every term in an exceptional sequence is either relatively projective or relatively injective or both and we refine this bijection to one between projectively signed exceptional sequences and ordered partial positive clusters. We also give a characterization of relatively projective/injective objects in terms of supports of the objects in the exceptional sequence.</description>

      <title>The Reverse Littlewood--Offord problem of Erd\H{o}s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon_{1},\ldots,\epsilon_{n}$ be a sequence of independent Rademacher random variables. We prove that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for any unit vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$,
  $$\Pr\left[||\epsilon_1 v_1+\ldots+\epsilon_n v_n||_2 \leq \sqrt{2}\right]\geq \frac{c}{n}.$$
  This resolves the only remaining conjecture from the seminal paper of Erd\H{o}s on the Littlewood--Offord problem, and it is sharp both in the sense that the constant $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be reduced and that the magnitude $n^{-1}$ is best possible. We also prove polynomial bounds for the analogous problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality and Concentration Inequalities of Statistics of Core Partitions with Bounded Perimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core partitions have attracted much attention since Anderson's work (2002) on the number of $(s,t)$-core partitions for coprime $s,t$. Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying the limiting distributions of the sizes of random simultaneous core partitions. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic normality of certain statistics of uniform random core partitions with bounded perimeters in the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein $W_1$ distances, including the length and size of a random (strict) $n$-core partition, the length of the Durfee square and the size of a random self-conjugate $n$-core partition. Accordingly, we prove that these statistics are subgaussian. This contrasts with the asymptotic behavior of the size of a random $(s, t)$-core partition for coprime $s,t$ studied by Even-Zohar (2022), which converges in law to Watson's $U^2$ distribution. Our results show that the distribution of the size of a random strict $(n, dn+1)$-core partition is asymptotically normal when $d \ge 3$ is fixed and $n$ tends to infinity, which is an analog of Zaleski's conjecture (2017) and covers Koml\'{o}s, Sergel, and Tusn\'{a}dy's result (2020) as a special case. Our proof integrates a variety of combinatorial and probabilistic tools, including Stein's method based on Hoeffding decomposition, Hoeffding's combinatorial central limit theorem, the Efron-Stein inequalities on product spaces and slices, and asymptotics of P\'{o}lya frequency sequences. Furthermore, our approach is potentially applicable to the study of the asymptotic normality of functionals of random variables with certain global dependence structures that can be decomposed into appropriate mixture forms.</description>
