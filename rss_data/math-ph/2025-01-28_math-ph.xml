      <description>arXiv:2501.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider and reformulate a recent definition of multiplication between distributions. We show that this definition can be adopted, in particular, to prove biorthonormality of some distributions arising when looking to the (generalized) eigenvalues of a specific non self-adjoint number-like operator, considered in connection with the recently introduced {\em weak pseudo-bosons}. Several examples are discussed in details.</description>

      <title>Bulk-edge correspondence in finite photonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the bulk-edge correspondence principle for finite two-dimensional photonic structures. Specifically, we focus on the divergence-form operator with periodic coefficients and prove the equality between the well-known gap Chern number (the bulk invariant) and an edge index defined via a trace formula for the operator restricted to a finite domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the edge index characterizes the circulation of electromagnetic energy along the system's boundary and the BEC principle is a consequence of energy conservation. The proof leverages Green function techniques, which relax the smoothness requirements on the underlying structures and can be extended to other systems. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing robust topological photonic devices with finite geometries, complementing recent advancements in discrete models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present systems of parabosons and parafermions in the context of Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras, $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebras and $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebras. For certain relevant $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebras and $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebras, some structure theory in terms of roots and root vectors is developed. The short root vectors of these algebras are identified with parastatistics operators. For the $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebra $so_q(2n+1)$, a system consisting of two ensembles of parafermions satisfying relative paraboson relations are introduced. For the $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebra $osp(1,0|2n_1,2n_2)$, a system consisting of two ensembles of parabosons satisfying relative parafermion relations are introduced.</description>

      <title>Exponential Control of Excitations for Trapped BEC in the Gross-Pitaevskii Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider trapped Bose gases in three dimensions in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime whose low energy states are well known to exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation. That is, the majority of the particles occupies the same condensate state. We prove exponential control of the number of particles orthogonal to the condensate state, generalizing recent results for translation invariant systems.</description>

      <title>On the level lines of two-layer symmetric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the behavior of level lines of two-dimensional potentials, which play an important role in the physics of ``two-layer'' systems. Potentials of this type are quasiperiodic and, at the same time, can also be considered as a model of random potentials on a plane. The description of level lines of such potentials is a special case of the Novikov problem for potentials with four quasiperiods and uses many features that arise in the study of the general Novikov problem. At the same time, the potentials under consideration also have their own clearly expressed specificity, which makes them very interesting for research from a variety of points of view.</description>

      <title>Degree of freedom count in linear gauge invariant PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose a system of partial differential equations with constant coefficients describes a classical field theory. Einstein proposed a definition of the strength of such a theory and its degrees of freedom (DoF) based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the system. however, direct calculating the DoF is a nontrivial task. Here, we apply commutative algebra methods to this problem.
  We begin by interpreting the matrix of the system as a linear map between polynomial modules. First, we derive an explicit formula for the DoF as the multiplicity of a certain extension module. Second, we prove (for homogeneous and certain more general systems) another explicit formula for the DoF in terms of gauge symmetries and identities. A notable consequence of this formula is that two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF.</description>

      <title>The Vlasov Bivector: A Parameter-Free Approach to Vlasov Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma kinetics, for both flat and curved spacetime, is conventionally performed on the mass shell, a 7--dimensional time-phase space with a Vlasov vector field, also known as the Liouville vector field. The choice of this time-phase space encodes the parameterisation of the underling 2nd order ordinary differential equations. By replacing the Vlasov vector on time-phase space with a bivector on an 8--dimensional sub-bundle of the tangent bundle, we create a parameterisation free version of Vlasov theory. This has a number of advantages, which include working for lightlike and ultra-relativistic particles, non metric connections, and metric-free and premetric theories. It also works for theories where no time-phase space can exist for topological topological reasons. An example of this is when we wish to consider all geodesics, including spacelike geodesics.
  We extend the particle density function to a 6--form on the subbundle of the tangent space, and define the transport equations, which correspond to the Vlasov equation. We then show how to define the corresponding 3--current on spacetime. We discuss the stress-energy tensor needed for the Einstein-Vlasov system.
  This theory can be generalised to create parameterisation invariant Vlasov theories for many 2nd order theories, on arbitrary manifolds. The relationship to sprays and semi-sprays is given and examples from Finsler geometry are also given.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Homotopy Analysis Method using the Least Action Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) is a powerful technique which allows to derive approximate solutions of both ordinary and partial differential equations. We propose to use a variational approach based on the Least Action Principle (LAP) in order to improve the efficiency of the HAM when applied to Lagrangian systems. The extremization of the action is achieved by varying the HAM parameter, therefore controlling the accuracy of the approximation. As case studies we consider the harmonic oscillator, the cubic and the quartic anharmonic oscillators, and the Korteweg-de Vries partial differential equation. We compare our results with those obtained using the standard approach, which is based on the residual error square method. We see that our method accelerates the convergence of the HAM parameter to the exact value in the cases in which the exact solution is known. When the exact solution is not analytically known, we find that our method performs better than the standard HAM for the cases we have analyzed. Moreover, our method shows better performance when the order of the approximation is increased and when the nonlinearity of the equations is stronger.</description>

      <title>On the structure of tensor products of the finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review some important facts about the structure of tensor products of finite dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. This is done from the elementary standpoint of the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras in the scope of a masters thesis. We set the focus on drawing the line to the finite dimensional representation theory of quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, the theory of q-characters, and introduce the so called snake modules together with their character formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the equivalence between the partition function of an adsorbing Dyck walk model and the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP) normalization to obtain the thermodynamic limit of the locus of the ASEP normalization zeros from a conformal map. We discuss the equivalence between this approach and using an electrostatic analogy to determine the locus, both in the case of the ASEP and the random allocation model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalization of Birkhoff's theorem for higher dimensions in Lovelock gravity permits us to investigate the black hole solutions with horizon geometries of nonconstant curvature. We present a new class of exotic dyonic black holes in the context of Lovelock gravity and generalized quasitopological electromagnetism. First, we derive the polynomial equation that describes exotic dyonic black holes in Lovelock gravity with an arbitrary order. Next, the solutions that characterize dyonic exotic black holes of the Gauss-Bonnet and third order Lovelock gravities are worked out. Then we compute the basic thermodynamic quantities for these exotic dyonic black holes. It is also verified that these quantities satisfy the generalized first law and Smarr's relation. Furthermore, the impact of generalized quasitopological electromagnetism and topological parameters on the local stability of the resulting objects are also investigated.</description>

Abstract: Usually, convolution refers to Laplace convolution in the literature. But Mellin convolutions can yield very ueeful results. This aspect is illustrated in the coming sections. This paper deals with Mellin convolutions of products and ratios. Functions belonging to the pathway family of functions are considered. Several types of integral representations, their equivalent representations in terms of G and H-functions and their equivalent computable series representations are examined in this paper.</description>

      <title>On refactorization problems and rational Lax matrices of quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present rational Lax representations for one-component parametric quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps in both the abelian and non-abelian settings. We show that from the Lax matrices of a general class of non-abelian involutive Yang-Baxter maps ($\mathcal{K}$-list), by considering the symmetries of the $\mathcal{K}$-list maps, we obtain compatible refactorization problems with rational Lax matrices for other classes of non-abelian involutive Yang-Baxter maps ($\Lambda$, $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ lists). In the abelian setting, this procedure generates rational Lax representations for the abelian Yang-Baxter maps of the $F$ and $H$ lists. Additionally, we provide examples of non-involutive (abelian and non-abelian) multi-parametric Yang-Baxter maps, along with their Lax representations, which lie outside the preceding lists.</description>

      <title>Bipartite expansion beyond biparticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently suggested bipartite analysis extends the Kauffman planar decomposition to arbitrary $N$, i.e. extends it from the Jones polynomial to the HOMFLY polynomial. This provides a generic and straightforward non-perturbative calculus in an arbitrary Chern--Simons theory. Technically, this approach is restricted to knots and links which possess bipartite realizations, i.e. can be entirely glued from antiparallel lock (two-vertex) tangles rather than single-vertex $R$-matrices. However, we demonstrate that the resulting positive decomposition (PD), i.e. the representation of the fundamental HOMFLY polynomials as positive integer polynomials of the three parameters $\phi$, $\bar\phi$ and $D$, exists for arbitrary knots, not only bipartite ones. This poses new questions about the true significance of bipartite expansion, which appears to make sense far beyond its original scope, and its generalizations to higher representations. We have provided two explanations for the existence of the PD for non-bipartite knots. An interesting option is to resolve a particular bipartite vertex in a not-fully-bipartite diagram and reduce the HOMFLY polynomial to a linear combination of those for smaller diagrams. If the resulting diagrams correspond to bipartite links, this option provides a PD even to an initially non-bipartite knot. Another possibility for a non-bipartite knot is to have a bipartite clone with the same HOMFLY polynomial providing this PD. We also suggest a promising criterium for the existence of a bipartite realization behind a given PD, which is based on the study of the precursor Jones polynomials.</description>

      <title>Complete classification of integrability and non-integrability of S=1/2 spin chains with symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study S=1/2 quantum spin chains with shift-invariant and inversion-symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction, also known as zigzag spin chains. We completely classify the integrability and non-integrability of the above class of spin systems. We prove that in this class there are only two integrable models, a classical model and a model solvable by the Bethe ansatz, and all the remaining systems are non-integrable. Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>SUSY transformation as the coupler of non-interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional chains of atoms can be effectively described by one-dimensional Dirac-type equation. Crystal structure of the chain is reflected by pseudo-spin of the quasi-particles. In the article, we present a simple framework where supersymmetric transformation is utilized to generate an interaction between two, initially non-interacting systems described by pseudo-spin-one Dirac-type equation. In the presented example, the transformation converts two asymptotically non-interacting atomic chains into a saw chain locally. The model possesses a flat band whose energy can be fine-tuned deliberately.</description>

      <title>Instability bands for periodic traveling waves in the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two families of periodic traveling waves exist in the focusing mKdV (modified Korteweg-de Vries) equation. Spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to co-periodic perturbations of the same period has been previously explored by using spectral analysis and variational formulation. By using tools of integrability such as a relation between squared eigenfunctions of the Lax pair and eigenfunctions of the linearized stability problem, we revisit the spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to perturbations of arbitrary periods. In agreement with previous works, we find that one family is spectrally stable for all parameter configurations, whereas the other family is spectrally unstable for all parameter configurations. We show that the onset of the co-periodic instability for the latter family changes the instability bands from figure-$8$ (crossing at the imaginary axis) into figure-$\infty$ (crossing at the real axis).</description>

      <title>Traveling periodic waves and breathers in the nonlocal derivative NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlocal derivative NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation describes modulations of waves in a stratified fluid and a continuous limit of the Calogero--Moser--Sutherland system of particles. For the defocusing version of this equation, we prove the linear stability of the nonzero constant background for decaying and periodic perturbations and the nonlinear stability for periodic perturbations. For the focusing version of this equation, we prove linear and nonlinear stability of the nonzero constant background under some restrictions. For both versions, we characterize the traveling periodic wave solutions by using Hirota's bilinear method, both on the nonzero and zero backgrounds. For each family of traveling periodic waves, we construct families of breathers which describe solitary waves moving across the stable background. A general breather solution with $N$ solitary waves propagating on the traveling periodic wave background is derived in a closed determinant form.</description>

      <title>Hard edge asymptotics of correlation functions between singular values and eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any square complex matrix of size $n\times n$ can be partially characterized by its $n$ eigenvalues and/or $n$ singular values. While no one-to-one correspondence exists between those two kinds of values on a deterministic level, for random complex matrices drawn from a bi-unitarily invariant ensemble, a bijection exists between the underlying singular value ensemble and the corresponding eigenvalue ensemble. This enabled the recent finding of an explicit formula for the joint probability density between $1$ eigenvalue and $k$ singular values, coined $1,k$-point function. We derive here the large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin (hard edge) for a large subclass of bi-unitarily invariant ensembles called P\'olya ensembles. This subclass contains all Meijer-G ensembles and, in particular, Muttalib-Borodin ensembles and the classical Wishart-Laguerre (complex Ginibre), Jacobi (truncated unitary), Cauchy-Lorentz ensembles. We show that the latter three ensembles share the same asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around the origin. In the case of Jacobi ensembles, there exists another hard edge for the singular values, namely the upper edge of their support, which corresponds to a soft edge for the singular value (soft-hard edge). We give the explicit large $n$ asymptotic of the $1,k$-point function around this soft-hard edge.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions and its homological countparts.
  The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a geometrically well-approximable pair $(X,\theta)$. This notion compares a constant $L(X)$ that can be bounded by the geometric information of the Riemann surface $X$ with a constant $L_0(\theta)$ that depends only on the arithmetic information of the irrational number $\theta$. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional.
  We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective non-equilibrium dynamics of multi-component mixtures of interacting active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles have garnered great interest in the physics community. However, the mathematical understanding of these systems remains partial. In this work, we consider a lattice gas model of active-passive particle mixtures with exclusion, where the self-propulsion orientations of active particles undergo Brownian motion on a torus. We derive the hydrodynamic equations governing the particle densities. Due to the presence of two types of particles with continuous-valued orientations, further generalizations of non-gradient decomposition and spectral gap estimation developed for the pure active case are necessitated, which entails novel challenges and new proofs.</description>

      <title>Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the so-called group geometric approach to (super)gravity and (super)string theories, any compact Lie group manifold $G_{c}$ can be smoothly deformed into a group manifold $G_{c}^{\mu }$ (locally diffeomorphic to $G_{c}$ itself), which is `soft', namely, based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein $\mu $, which violates the Maurer-Cartan equations and consequently has a non-vanishing associatedcurvature two-form. Within the framework based on the above deformation (`softening'), we show how to construct an infinite-dimensional(infinite-rank), generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $%G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to $G_{c} $. As an application, we consider KM algebras associated to deformed manifolds such as the `soft' circle, the `soft' two-sphere and the `soft'three-sphere. While the generalized KM algebra associated to the deformed circle is trivially isomorphic to its undeformed analogue, and hence not new, the `softening' of the two- and three- sphere includes squashedmanifolds (and in particular, the so-called Berger three-sphere) and yields to non-trivial results.</description>

      <title>Liouville Brownian motion and quantum cones in dimension $d &gt; 2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $d &gt; 2$ and $\gamma \in (0, \sqrt{2d})$, we study the Liouville Brownian motion associated with the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We compute its spectral dimension, i.e., the short-time asymptotics of the heat kernel along the diagonal, which, in contrast to the two-dimensional case, depends on both $\gamma$ and on the thickness of the starting point. Furthermore, for even dimensions $d &gt; 2$, we show that the spherical average process of the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be identified with the integral of a stationary Gaussian Markov process of order $(d-2)/2$. Exploiting this representation, we construct the higher-dimensional analogue of the $\beta$-quantum cone for $\beta \in (-\infty, Q)$, with $Q = d/\gamma + \gamma/2$. Lastly, for $\alpha = Q - \sqrt{Q^2-4}$, we prove that the law of the $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-quantum cone is invariant under shifts along the trajectories of the associated Liouville Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: We explore a system of two-species fermions with $N$ particles. Through this exploration, we establish a two-species Husimi measure and construct a two-species Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy with error terms. We provide proofs of the smallness of these errors in the semiclassical and mean-field limits, fixing $\hbar = N^{-1/3}$. After that, we rigorously establish the uniqueness of this hierarchy. This allows us to conclude that the two-species Husimi measure from the solution of the $N$-particle Schr\"odinger equation approximates the solution of the Vlasov equation for two-species systems.</description>

      <title>The Pauli-Villars regularised free energy of Dirac's vacuum in purely magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac vacuum is a non-linear polarisable medium rather than an empty space. This non-linear behaviour starts to be significant for extremely large electromagnetic fields such as the magnetic field on the surface of certain neutron stars. Even though the null temperature case was deeply studied in the past decades, the problem at non-zero temperature needs to be better understood. In this work, we present the first rigorous derivation of the one-loop effective magnetic Lagrangian at positive temperature, a non-linear functional describing the free energy of the Dirac vacuum in a classical magnetic field. After introducing our model, we properly define the free energy functional using the Pauli-Villars regularisation technique in order to remove the worst ultraviolet divergences, which represent a well known issue of the theory. The study of the properties of this functional is addressed before focusing on the limit of slowly varying classical magnetic fields. In this regime, we prove the convergence of this functional to the Euler-Heisenberg formula with thermal corrections, recovering the effective Lagrangian first derived by Dittrich in 1979.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a research program for the systematic investigation of quantum superintegrable systems involving the interaction of two non-relativistic particles with spin $1/2$ moving in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In this paper, we focus specifically on such superintegrable systems that allow additional scalar integrals of motion, linear in the momenta. We first identify specific potentials appearing in the Hamiltonian that should be excluded from the analysis, as they can be immediately derived through gauge transformations of the natural Hamiltonian. Next, we construct the most general symmetric scalar operator and derive the determining equations from its commutation with the Hamiltonian. Solving these equations, we obtain 30 new superintegrable systems with spin, along with their corresponding first-order scalar integrals of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

      <title>v-representability and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials in the one-dimensional torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the ground-state density of any non-interacting Schr\"odinger operator on the one-dimensional torus with potentials in a certain class of distributions is strictly positive. This result together with recent results from [Sutter el al (2024), J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 475202] provides a complete characterization of the set of non-interacting v-representable densities on the torus. Moreover, we prove that, for said class of non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem holds, i.e., the external potential is uniquely determined by the ground-state density. In particular, the density-to-potential Kohn-Sham map is single-valued, and the non-interacting Lieb functional is differentiable at every point in this space of $v$-representable densities. These results contribute to establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the Kohn-Sham scheme in this simplified setting.</description>

Abstract: We solve the problem posed in [Random Matrices: Theory and Applications, 10(03):2150027, 2021]. Plainly, let $K$ and $Q$ be two $\mathbb{F}$-valued functions over $\Lambda^2$, where $\Lambda$ is some abstract set (of arbitrary cardinality) and $\mathbb{F}$ is an arbitrary field. If $Q$ and $K$ are related via $$\det(Q(x_i,x_j))_{i,j=1}^n=\det(K(x_i,x_j))_{i,j=1}^n,$$ for every $x_1,\ldots,x_n\in\Lambda$ and $n&gt;0$, what are all the possible transformations that transform $Q$ into $K$? The aforementioned paper conjectured the following two: $(Tf)(x,y)=f(y,x)$; and $(Tf)(x,y)=g(x)g(y)^{-1}f(x,y)$ for some non-zero function $g$. Restricting to symmetric $K$ and $Q$, the same paper confirms this conjectured classification. By extending the graph-theoretic techniques of said paper, we show that, while there do exist counterexamples, under some surprisingly simple and natural conditions the conjecture remains valid even with the symmetry constraints on $K$ and $Q$ relaxed.
  By taking $\Lambda$ finite, the above problem, furthermore, reduces to that between two square matrices investigated in [Raphael Loewy, Principal minors and diagonal similarity of matrices, Linear Algebra and its Applications 78 (1986), 23--64]. Hence, our paper additionally sheds light on an underlying combinatorial structure, and presents a non-linear-algebraic proof that uses only elementary combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Universality of global asymptotics of Jack-deformed random Young diagrams at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two distinct discrete versions of $\beta$-ensembles in the high, low and fixed temperature regimes. Our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and \'Sniady.
  We first introduce a special class of Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size, called the ``Jack--Thoma measures'', and prove the LLN and CLT in the three aforementioned limit regimes. In each case, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed as sums of weighted lattice paths. Second, we show that the previous formulas are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations for the model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size derived from Jack characters with the approximate factorization property. Finally, in stark contrast with continuous $\beta$-ensembles, we show that the limit shapes at high and low temperatures of our random Young diagrams are one-sided infinite staircase shapes. For the Jack--Plancherel measure, we describe this shape explicitly by relating its local minima with the zeroes of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>Functional separation solutions of the Sinh-Gordon type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: Which hyperbolic or elliptic PDEs admit functional separable solutions. We shall focus on the study of a sinh-Gordon type equation. We construct solutions to this equation via the method of functional separation. We prove that these are the only families that have the property of functional separation and so we obtain a classification. To this end, we construct new families of solutions for the hyperbolic and elliptic versions of both sine and sinh Gordon equations in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Berry Connections for 2d $(2,2)$ Theories, Monopole Spectral Data &amp; (Generalised) Cohomology Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Berry connections for supersymmetric ground states of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSMs quantised on a circle, which are generalised periodic monopoles. Periodic monopole solutions may be encoded into difference modules, as shown by Mochizuki, or into an alternative algebraic construction given in terms of vector bundles endowed with filtrations. By studying the ground states in terms of a one-parameter family of supercharges, we relate these two different kinds of spectral data to the physics of the GLSMs. From the difference modules we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes, which in the conformal limit yield novel difference equations for hemisphere or vortex partition functions. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the two kinds of spectral data are related to different (generalised) cohomology theories: the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, whereas the vector bundles with filtrations are related to its equivariant K-theory.</description>

      <title>Homogenization and continuum limit of mechanical metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When used in bulk applications, mechanical metamaterials set forth a multiscale problem with many orders of magnitude in scale separation between the micro and macro scales. However, mechanical metamaterials fall outside conventional homogenization theory on account of the flexural, or bending, response of their members, including torsion. We show that homogenization theory, based on calculus of variations and notions of Gamma-convergence, can be extended to account for bending. The resulting homogenized metamaterials exhibit intrinsic generalized elasticity in the continuum limit. We illustrate these properties in specific examples including two-dimensional honeycomb and three-dimensional octet-truss metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Efficient explicit gate construction of block-encoding for Hamiltonians needed for simulating partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is solving partial differential equations (PDEs). By using the Schrodingerisation technique - which converts non-conservative PDEs into Schrodinger equations - the problem can be reduced to Hamiltonian simulations. The particular class of Hamiltonians we consider is shown to be sufficient for simulating almost any linear PDE. In particular, these Hamiltonians consist of discretizations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This paper addresses an important gap by efficiently loading these Hamiltonians into the quantum computer through block-encoding. The construction is explicit and efficient in terms of one- and two-qubit operations, forming a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for that class of Hamiltonians. The proposed algorithm demonstrates a squared logarithmic scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, offering a polynomial speedup over classical finite-difference methods in the context of spatial partitioning for PDE solving. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the multi-dimensional case, achieving an exponential acceleration with respect to the number of dimensions, alleviating the curse of dimensionality problem. This work provides an essential foundation for developing explicit and efficient quantum circuits for PDEs, Hamiltonian simulations, and ground state and thermal state preparation.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction of Generalized ASD Instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generalized anti-self-dual instantons defined over Riemannian manifolds equipped with a parallel codimension-$4$ differential form. In particular, for product Riemannian manifolds possessing such a form, we study dimension reduction phenomena, finding a topological criterion for bundles which, when satisfied, allows for a complete characterization of dimension reduction for the corresponding moduli space of generalized ASD instantons. By establishing an integrability result for families of connections, we then deduce explicit descriptions for these moduli spaces, including those of Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, $G_2$-, and $\Spin(7)$-instantons. When one factor in the product is a $4$-manifold, we establish well-behaved compactifications for these moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>On Spectral Data for $(2,2)$ Berry Connections, Difference Equations &amp; Equivariant Quantum Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Berry connections of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) quantized on a circle, which are periodic monopoles, with the aim to provide a fruitful physical arena for recent mathematical constructions related to the latter. These are difference modules encoding monopole solutions via a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence established by Mochizuki. We demonstrate how the difference modules arise naturally by studying the ground states as the cohomology of a one-parameter family of supercharges. In particular, we show how they are related to one kind of monopole spectral data, a quantization of the Cherkis-Kapustin spectral curve, and relate them to the physics of the GLSM. By considering states generated by D-branes and leveraging the difference modules, we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes. We then show that in the conformal limit, these degenerate into novel difference equations for hemisphere partition functions, which are exactly calculable. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. In contrast, examples exhibiting additivity, though relatively rare, offer crucial insights into the origins of nonadditivity and form the basis of our strongest upper bounds on capacity. Degradable channels, whose coherent information is provably additive, stand out as among the few classes of channels for which the quantum capacity is exactly computable.
  In this paper, we introduce two families of non-degradable channels whose coherent information remains additive, making their quantum capacities tractable. First, we demonstrate that channels capable of ``outperforming" their environment, under conditions weaker than degradability, can exhibit either strong or weak additivity of coherent information. Second, we explore a complementary construction that modifies a channel to preserve coherent information additivity while destroying the ``outperforming" property. We analyze how structural constraints guarantee strong and weak additivity and investigate how relaxing these constraints leads to the failure of strong additivity, with weak additivity potentially persisting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-point restriction of the conformal blocks on $(\mathbb{P}^1,\infty, w,0)$ defined by modules over a vertex operator algebra. By restricting the module attached to the point $\infty$ to its bottom degree, we obtain a new formula to calculate fusion rules using a module over the degree-zero Borcherds' Lie algebra. This formula holds under more general assumptions than Frenkel-Zhu's fusion rules theorem. By restricting the module attached to the point $w$ to its bottom degree, we obtain a more general version of Li's nuclear democracy theorem for vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of its unbroken ${\cal PT}-$symmetry, the popular imaginary cubic oscillator Hamiltonian $H^{(IC)}=p^2+{\rm i}x^3$ does not satisfy all of the necessary postulates of quantum mechanics. The failure is due to the ``intrinsic exceptional point'' (IEP) features of $H^{(IC)}$ and, in particular, to the phenomenon of a high-energy asymptotic parallelization of its bound-state-mimicking eigenvectors. In the paper it is argued that the operator $H^{(IC)}$ (and the like) can only be interpreted as a manifestly unphysical, singular IEP limit of a hypothetical one-parametric family of certain standard quantum Hamiltonians. For explanation, an ample use is made of perturbation theory and of multiple analogies between IEPs and conventional Kato's exceptional points.</description>

Abstract: Generating functions $h_r(\tau)$ of D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, appearing in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identical to rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants, are known to be higher depth mock modular forms satisfying a specific modular anomaly equation, with depth determined by the D4-brane charge $r$. We develop a method to solve the anomaly equation for arbitrary charges, in terms of indefinite theta series. This allows us to find the generating functions up to modular forms that can be fixed by computing just a finite number of Fourier coefficients of $h_r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional symmetries were introduced by Levi and Winternitz in their 1989 seminal paper to deal with nonlinear PDEs. Here we discuss their application in the framework of ODEs, and more specifically Dynamical Systems; it turns out they are closely related to two established -- albeit maybe less widely known -- concepts, i.e. orbital symmetries and configurational invariants. The paper is devoted to studying the interplay of these notions, and their application in the study of Dynamical Systems, with special attention to invariant manifolds of these.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first step in investigating fractional difference maps, which do not have periodic points except fixed points, is to find asymptotically periodic points and bifurcation points and draw asymptotic bifurcation diagrams. Recently derived equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points contain coefficients defined as slowly converging infinite sums. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for coefficients of the equations that allow calculations of asymptotically periodic and bifurcation points in fractional difference maps.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation(QEM), an error suppression strategy without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum~(NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly been focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose a non-Markovian Noise Mitigation(NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions(BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that will make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on a spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>
