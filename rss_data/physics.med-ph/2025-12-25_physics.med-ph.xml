      <title>Study of the Influence of Implant Material on Magnetocardiography Measurements Using SQUID Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetocardiography system is a medical device that diagnoses cardiac disease by measuring magnetic fields generated from electric currents flowing through the myocardium. However, the accuracy of measurement data can be degraded if strong magnetic materials are present or magnetic field changes occur near the MCG system. With the widespread use of implants, the number of patients with metallic implants is increasing, but there is a lack of in-depth research on the potential impact of implant materials on the results of the MCG examination. This study aims to analyze the effect of implant materials on MCG measurements and establish relevant criteria. In this study, a 96-channel MCG system employing Superconducting Quantum Interference Device sensors, specifically first-order gradiometers based on the Double Relaxation Oscillation SQUID method, and a Magnetically Shielded Room were utilized. Ti6Al4V ELI was selected as the representative implant material sample. Experiments were conducted under extreme conditions, where a sample significantly larger than an actual implant was placed as close as possible to the sensors. As a result, when the implant material was at the minimum distance to the sensor, the noise increase was approximately 0.7 fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which satisfies the sensitivity criteria for MCG. Furthermore, since these results were obtained under severely adverse conditions designed to maximize the noise impact, it is anticipated that the effect would be even more negligible in actual clinical settings. In conclusion, it was confirmed that common implant materials have little to no effect on MCG measurements. However, as the experiments were not conducted with the material inserted into the human body, unlike actual clinical environments, the generation of magnetic fields due to micromotion has not been verified, thus requiring further experimentation.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Multiscale Learned Invertible Reconstruction for Cone Beam CT: From Simulated to Real Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is an important imaging modality nowadays, however lower image quality of CBCT compared to more conventional Computed Tomography (CT) remains a limiting factor in CBCT applications. Deep learning reconstruction methods are a promising alternative to classical analytical and iterative reconstruction methods, but applying such methods to CBCT is often difficult due to the lack of ground truth data, memory limitations and the need for fast inference at clinically-relevant resolutions. In this work we propose LIRE++, an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction. Memory optimizations and multiscale reconstruction allow for fast training and inference, while rotational equivariance improves parameter efficiency. LIRE++ was trained on simulated projection data from a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator that we developed as well. Evaluated on synthetic data, LIRE++ gave an average improvement of 1 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep learning baselines. On real clinical data, LIRE++ improved the average Mean Absolute Error between the reconstruction and the corresponding planning CT by 10 Hounsfield Units with respect to current proprietary state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning/iterative method.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Uncertainty Quantification for Computational Point-of-care Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.</description>
