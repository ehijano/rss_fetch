      <title>Influence of new states in searches for negative gauge-Higgs couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how constraints based on interference effects for the negative gauge-Higgs coupling scenario are affected by new physics. Models that achieve this wrong-sign gauge-Higgs coupling inevitably have new charged Higgs states. These states affect the interpretation of interference effects. We recast the ATLAS analysis for VBF $Wh$, showing that the previously excluded negative gauge-Higgs coupling scenario is still experimentally viable for charged Higgs masses below $370$ GeV. We discuss how to further constrain the parameter space and point out the potential of VBF $Zh$ to exclude this scenario in a model-independent way.</description>

      <title>Polarization and kinematic properties of the splitting functions $q\to W^\pm +q'$ and $q\to Z^0 +q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the processes $g\to W{+}\,q'$ and $q\to Z{+}\,q$ and derive the respective splitting functions as functions of two kinematic variables: the longitudinal momentum fraction $z$ and transverse momentum $p_T$ of the produced bosons with respect to the parent quark. We take into account kinematic (phase space) restrictions connected with nonzero masses of the gauge bosons and with limited initial energy. We separately consider three different polarization states of the bosons.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in invisible Dark Matter mediator production associated with $t \bar{t}$ final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two sets of different CP-sensitive observables inspired by the Higgs production in association with the top quark. We employ a Dark Matter simplified model that couples a scalar particle with three generation fermions with a mass equal to that of the top quark. The reconstruction of the kinematic variables is presented at NLO accuracy for events associated with this massive scalar particle, which is assumed to be vanishing to invisible decays in a detector such as ATLAS. We build these observables by taking advantage of the similarity between the scalar coupling with the top quark and the factorization theorem in the total scattering amplitude, in order to represent the basis in which the phase space is parameterized. A twofold approach employs the direct implementation of the four-momentum phase space measure in building CP sensitive observables such as $b_{2}$ for the Higgs, and the spin polarization of the top-quark decays in the narrow width approximation for the employed model. We studied the asymmetries of these distributions to test for any improvement in increasing the exclusion region for the $g_{u_{33}}^S-g_{u_{33}}^P$ parameters associated with this vanishing scalar particle. We have found no significant effect in the exclusion limits by using the forward-backward asymmetry distributions and the full shaped ones. The best limits obtained for $g_{u_{33}}^S$ at NLO accuracy were obtained: $b_{2}:[-0.0425, 0.0475]$ $n_{4}: [-0.0450, 0.0450] $ for an invisible scalar with a mass of 10$^{-2}$ GeV for a luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$ expected for the end of Run 3 of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopole Phenomenology at Future Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the grand tapestry of Physics, the magnetic monopole is a holy grail. Therefore, numerous efforts are underway in search of this hypothetical particle at CMS, ATLAS and MoEDAL experiments of LHC by employing different production mechanisms. The cornerstone of our comprehension of monopoles lies in Dirac's theory which outlines their characteristics and dynamics. Within this theoretical framework, an effective $U(1)$ gauge field theory, derived from conventional models, delineates the interaction between spin magnetically-charged fields and ordinary photons under electric-magnetic dualization.
  The focus of this paper is the production of magnetic monopoles from Drell-Yan and the Photon-Fusion mechanisms to produce velocity-dependent scalar, fermionic, and vector monopoles of spin angular momentum $0,\frac{1}{2},1$ respectively at LHC. A computational work is performed to compare the monopole pair-production cross-sections for both methods at different center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s}$) with various magnetic dipole moments. The comparison of kinematic distributions of monopoles at Parton and reconstructed level are demonstrated including both DY and PF mechanisms.
  Extracted results showcase how modern machine-learning techniques can be used to study the production of magnetic monopoles at the Future proton-proton Particle Colliders at 100 TeV. We demonstrate the observability of magnetic monopoles against the most relevant Standard Model background using multivariate methods such as Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), Likelihood, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). This study compares the performance of these classifiers with traditional cut-based and counting approaches, proving the superiority of our methods.</description>

      <title>Ultra-light Dark Matter Limits from Astrophysical Neutrino Flavor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-light dark matter is a class of dark matter models where the mass of the dark matter particle is very small and the dark matter behaves as a classical field pervading our galaxy. If astrophysical neutrinos interact with ultra-light dark matter, these interactions would produce a matter potential in our galaxy which may cause anomalous flavor conversions. Recently, IceCube high-energy starting event flavor measurements are used to set stringent limits on isotropic Lorentz violating fields under the Standard-Model Extension framework. We apply the IceCube Lorentz violation limits to set limits on neutrino - ultra-light dark matter couplings. We assume the dark matter field undergoes fast oscillations in our galaxy, yielding neutrino interactions with dark matter that broaden and smear the observed flavor structure of astrophysical neutrinos at IceCube. The constraints we obtain are an order of magnitude tighter than current and future terrestrial neutrino experimental limits. The sensitivity of ultra-light dark matter can be further improved in the near future by new particle identification algorithms in IceCube and the emergence of next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting the hidden-strange pentaquarklike state $N^{*}(2080)$ in the $\pi^{-} p\rightarrow\phi n$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the production of the hidden-strange pentaquarklike state $N^{*}(2080)$ via the $\pi^{-} p$ scattering process is studied by the effective Lagrangian approach. Concretely, we consider the $\rho$ meson exchange of $t$-channel and the nucleon exchange of $u$-channel, which are treated as the background terms, and take into account the contribution of the $N^{*}(2080)$ via the $s$-channel as a signal term. By global fitting of the total and differential cross sections of the $\pi^{-} p\rightarrow\phi n$ process, it is shown that the $N^{*}(2080)$ contributes an obvious peak at the threshold energy point of the differential cross section at the forward angle ($\cos\theta = 1$), which provides clues to the detection of the $N^{*}(2080)$ by the $\pi^{-} p$ scattering process. However, due to the limited accuracy of the experimental data, it is an objective limitation for us to determine the properties of the $N^{*}(2080)$ by the $\pi^{-} p$ scattering process. Therefore, more accurate experimental measurements of the $\pi^{-} p\rightarrow\phi n$ reaction are highly desirable, and we have also proposed that correlation measurements can be performed on J-PARC, AMBER, and future HIKE and HIAF meson beam experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved analysis of the decay width of $t\to Wb$ up to N$^{3}$LO QCD corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the top-quark decay $t\to Wb$ up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^{3}$LO) QCD corrections. For the purpose, we first adopt the principle of maximum conformality (PMC) to deal with the initial pQCD series, and then we adopt the Bayesian analysis approach, which quantifies the unknown higher-order (UHO) terms' contributions in terms of a probability distribution, to estimate the possible magnitude of the N$^{4}$LO QCD corrections. In our calculation, an effective strong coupling constant $\alpha_{s}(Q_{*})$ is determined by using all non-conformal $\{\beta_{i}\}$ terms associated with the renormalization group equation. This results in the next-to-leading-log PMC scale $Q_{*}^{(\rm NLL)}=10.3048$ GeV, which could be regarded as the correct momentum flow of the process. Consequently, we obtain an improved scale invariant pQCD prediction for the top-quark decay width $\Gamma_{t}^{\rm tot} = 1.3172 \pm 0.0038$ GeV, where the error is the squared average of the uncertainties from the decay width of $W$-boson $\Delta \Gamma_{W} = \pm 0.042$ GeV, the coupling constant $\Delta \alpha_{s}(m_{Z}) = \pm 0.0009$ and the predicted N$^{4}$LO-level UHO-terms. The magnitude of the top-quark pole mass greatly affects the total decay width. By further taking the PDG top-quark pole mass error from cross-section measurements $\Delta m_{t} = \pm 0.7$ GeV into consideration, we obtain $\Gamma_{t}^{\rm tot} = 1.3172 ^{+0.0194}_{-0.0192}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of $[8]_{[c\bar{s}]} \otimes [8]_{[q \bar{q^\prime}]}$ systems with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^\pm$ and $1^\pm$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental progress on the $T_{c\bar{s}0}^a(2900)^{0/++}$, the fully open tetraquark spectrum with the configuration of $[8]_{[c\bar{s}]} \otimes [8]_{[q \bar{q^\prime}]}$ is systematically investigated by the QCD sum rules. In this article, we concentrate on the quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{+}/0^{-}/1^{+}/1^{-}$.
  Firstly, we construct four scalar currents ($J^{P}=0^+$) in the form of $[8]_{[c\bar{s}]} \otimes [8]_{[u\bar{d}]}$ type tetraquark structure and perform the analysis of the QCD sum rules, where we consider the leading order contributions up to dimension 11 in the operator product expansion and retain contributions linear in the strange quark mass $m_s$. Our results, $M_{0^{+}}^A = 2.91_{-0.20}^{+0.20}~\text{GeV}$ and $M_{0^{+}}^C = 2.98_{-0.21}^{+0.20}~\text{GeV}$, are consistent with the experimentally discovered $T_{c\bar{s}0}^a(2900)^{++}$ within error margins. Thus, our calculation supports classifying $T_{c\bar{s}0}^a(2900)^{++}$ as a tetraquark state with the $[8]_{[c\bar{s}]} \otimes [8]_{u \bar{d}}$ color configuration.
  Moreover, on the basis of $J^P=0^+$, we also study tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^P=0^-$, $1^+$, and $1^-$, predicting two new hadronic states awaiting experimental verification for each quantum number. Their masses are as follows: $M_{0^{-}}^{A}=3.45_{-0.10}^{+0.12}~\text{GeV}$, $M_{0^{-}}^{D}=3.20_{-0.19}^{+0.17}~\text{GeV}$, $M_{1^{+}}^{A}=2.95_{-0.19}^{+0.19}~\text{GeV}$, $M_{1^{+}}^{C}={2.95_{-0.19}^{+0.19}}~\text{GeV}$, $M_{1^{-}}^{A}={3.23_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}~\text{GeV}$ and $M_{1^{-}}^{D}={3.23_{-0.11}^{+0.09}}~\text{GeV}$. With advances in experimental techniques and accumulation of new data, these predicted results are hoped to be confirmed in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Predicting isovector charmonium-like states from X(3872) properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using chiral effective field theory, we predict that there must be isovector charmonium-like $D\bar D^*$ hadronic molecules with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ denoted as $W_{c1}$. The inputs are the properties of the $X(3872)$, including its mass and the ratio of its branching fractions of decays into $J/\psi\rho^0$ and $J/\psi\omega$. The predicted states are virtual state poles of the scattering matrix, pointing at a molecular nature of the $X(3872)$ as well as its spin partners. They should show up as either a mild cusp or dip at the $D\bar D^*$ thresholds, explaining why they are elusive in experiments. The so far negative observation also indicates that the $X(3872)$ is either a bound state with non-vanishing binding energy or a virtual state, only in these cases the $X(3872)$ signal dominates over that from the $W_{c1}^0$. The pole positions are $3865.3^{+4.2}_{-7.4}- i 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ MeV for $W_{c1}^0$ and $3866.9^{+4.6}_{-7.7}- i (0.07\pm0.01)$ MeV for $W_{c1}^\pm$. The findings imply that the peak in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass distribution is not purely from the $X(3872)$ but contains contributions from $W_{c1}^0$ predicted here. The states should have isovector heavy quark spin partners with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $1^{+-}$, with the last one corresponding to $Z_c$. We suggest to search for the charged $0^{++}$, $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ states in $J/\psi\pi^\pm \pi^0$.</description>

      <title>Local clustering of relic neutrinos: Comparison of kinetic field theory and the Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational clustering in our cosmic vicinity is expected to lead to an enhancement of the local density of relic neutrinos. We derive expressions for the neutrino density, using a perturbative approach to kinetic field theory and perturbative solutions of the Vlasov equation up to second order. Our work reveals that both formalisms give exactly the same results and can thus be considered equivalent. Numerical evaluation of the local relic neutrino density at first and second order provides some fundamental insights into the frequently applied approach of linear response to neutrino clustering (also known as the Gilbert equation). Against the naive expectation, including the second-order contribution does not lead to an improvement of the prediction for the local relic neutrino density but to a dramatic overestimation. This is because perturbation theory breaks down in a momentum-dependent fashion and in particular for densities well below unity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the thin accretion disk behaviors surrounding black holes embedded in cold dark matter halos and scalar field dark matter halos. We first calculate the event horizons and derive the equations of motion and effective potential in black hole geometries with different dark matter halos. We then compute the specific energy, specific angular momentum, and angular velocity of particles moving along circular orbits. We also derive the effective potentials to find the locations of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and compare them to the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes without the dark matter haloes. We also use the observed ISCO of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, to constrain the dark matter halos and discuss the astrophysical Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) generation from systems.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Electroweak corrections to the Higgs boson rare decay process $H\to Z\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, ATLAS and CMS collaborations jointly announced the first evidence of the rare Higgs boson decay channel $H\to Z\gamma$, with a ratio of $2.2\pm 0.7$ times overshooting the leading order standard model (SM) prediction. In order to face this challenge, it is urgent to proceed an even accurate calculation within the SM. To this end, we calculate in this paper the next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections to $H\to Z\gamma$ process, in which the NLO quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections were found tiny. Our calculation finds that the inclusion of NLO EW corrections may greatly enhance the prediction reliability. To tame the theoretical uncertainty, we adopt five different renormalization schemes. Combining our result with previous NLO QCD corrections and the signal-background interference, we conclude that the excess in $H\to Z\gamma$ cannot be explained within the SM. In fact, the incompatibility between the SM prediction and the LHC measurement of the concerned process is exacerbated upon considering the higher order EW corrections, which implies something beyond the SM could be involved.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem in energy-dependent potentials using semi-classical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave equations with energy-dependent potentials appear in many areas of physics, ranging from nuclear physics to black hole perturbation theory. In this work, we use the semi-classical WKB method to first revisit the computation of bound states of potential wells and reflection/transmission coefficients in terms of the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule and the Gamow formula. We then discuss the inverse problem, in which the latter observables are used as a starting point to reconstruct the properties of the potentials. By extending known inversion techniques to energy-dependent potentials, we demonstrate that so-called width-equivalent or WKB-equivalent potentials are not isospectral anymore. Instead, we explicitly demonstrate that constructing quasi-isospectral potentials with the inverse techniques is still possible. Those reconstructed, energy-independent potentials share key properties with the width-equivalent potentials. We report that including energy-dependent terms allows for a rich phenomenology, particularly for the energy-independent equivalent potentials.</description>

      <title>A global analysis of $\pi^0$, $K_S^0$ and $\eta$ fragmentation functions with BESIII data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we conduct a global QCD analysis of fragmentation functions (FFs) for neutral pions ($\pi^0$), neutral kaons ($K_S^0$), and eta mesons ($\eta$), utilizing world data of single inclusive hadron production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation involving the most recent BESIII data with low collision energy, to test the operational region of QCD collinear factorization for single inclusive hadron production. We found that the QCD-based analysis at next-to-next-to leading order in perturbative QCD with parameterized higher-twist effects can explain both existing high-energy world data and the BESIII new measurements, while the latter cannot be explained with existing FFs extracted with high-energy data. To investigate the higher-twist contributions to this discrepancy, a direct functional approach is employed, providing testing framework for characterizing the experimental results over a wide range of energy scales, from low to high, thus extending the classical theoretical models to the BESIII domain.</description>

Abstract: A study of chiral-odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the nucleon is presented in the bag model demonstrating that in this model all four chiral-odd GPDs are non-zero contrary to other claims in literature. The bag model results for the GPDs $H_T^q(x,\xi,t)$, $E_T^q(x,\xi,t)$, $\tilde{H}_T^q(x,\xi,t)$ agree with other models within a typical quark model accuracy. We present one of the few quark model calculations where polynomiality is satisfied and the sum rule $\int dx\,\tilde{E}_T^q(x,\xi,t)=0$ holds. We confront our results with predictions from the large-$N_c$ limit, and with lattice QCD calculations. We conclude that the bag model successfully catches the main features of chiral-odd GPDs.</description>

      <title>Explaining Fermions Mass and Mixing Hierarchies through $U(1)_X$ and $Z_2$ Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For understanding the hierarchies of fermion masses and mixing, we extend the standard model gauge group with $U(1)_X$ and $Z_2$ symmetry. The field content of the Standard model is augmented by three heavy right-handed neutrinos and two new scalar singlets. $U(1)_X$ charges of different fields are considered after satisfying anomaly cancellation conditions. In this scenario, the fermion masses are generated through higher dimensional effective operators. The small neutrino masses are obtained through type-1 seesaw mechanism using the heavy right handed neutrino fields. We discuss the flavor-changing neutral current processes which is originated due to the sequential nature of $U(1)_X$ symmetry. We have written effective higher dimensional operators in terms of renormalizable dimension four operators by introducing vector like fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we perform an exploratory study of the photoproduction of singlet QED bound states $(l^-l^+)_S$ in electron - ion collisions at the EicC, EIC and LHeC energies. The total cross - sections, event rates per year and rapidity distributions associated with the parapositronium, paramuonium and paratauonium production are estimated. Moreover, we consider the decay of these states in a two - photon system and implement kinematical cuts on the rapidities and energies of the photons in the final state. We demonstrate the paramuonium can, in principle, be observed for the first time in all these colliders and that the EIC is a potential collider to discover the paratauonium state.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing of gravitational waves with modified propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of corrections to the propagation on the waveforms of gravitationally lensed gravitational waves under the geometrical optics approximation, focusing on both uniform cosmological modifications and local modifications localized around lensing objects. By adopting a model-independent phenomenological approach, we systematically investigate the effects of these modifications in strong lensing scenarios, where detection of multiple images is expected. Our analysis reveals that cosmological modifications can yield corrections to the time delay that remain to be minor compared with the effects that accumulate over the whole propagation process, which are present also in the unlensed waveform. By contrast, local modifications around lensing objects can alter the image position and also the magnification factor, which is potentially polarization-selective and frequency-dependent. In some case we can have image disappearance as well as signal amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such modifications can cause degradation of waveform match with the templates based on general relativity. This study highlights the importance of considering waveform modifications to search for the signature of modified propagation or the existence of extra polarization modes, and proposes potential observational targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strongly interacting system created in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions behaves almost as an ideal fluid with rich patterns of the velocity field exhibiting strong vortical structure. Vorticity of the fluid, via spin-orbit coupling, leads to particle spin polarization. Due to the finite orbital momentum of the system, the polarization on average is not zero; it depends on the particle momenta reflecting the spatial variation of the local vorticity. In the last few years, this field experienced a rapid growth due to experimental discoveries of the global and local polarizations. Recent measurements triggered further development of the theoretical description of the spin dynamics and suggestions of several new mechanisms for particle polarization.
  In this review, we focus mostly on the experimental results. We compare the measurements with the existing theoretical calculations but try to keep the discussion of possible underlying physics at the qualitative level. Future measurements and how they can help to answer open theoretical questions are also discussed. We pay a special attention to the employed experimental methods, as well as to the detector effects and associated corrections to the measurements.</description>

Abstract: Recent data for the masses of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons determined using methods of lattice QCD for several values of the charm quark mass different from its physical mass are analysed in Heavy Quark Effective Theory. Nonperturbative parameters are extracted that arise at order ${\cal O}(1/m_c)$ in the heavy-quark mass expansion of a heavy-light meson mass. The determined parameters are used to establish the charm quark masses corresponding to the employed lattice sets.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Physics with Joint Power Spectrum and Voxel Intensity Distribution Forecasts in Line-Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum and voxel intensity distribution (VID) are two summary statistics that can be applied to condense the information encoded in line-intensity maps. The information contained in both summary statistics is highly complementary, and their combination allows for a major increase in precision of parameter estimation from line-intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. Until recently, combination of these statistics required simulation-based estimations of their covariance. In this work we leverage an analytical model of covariance between these observables to run a joint Fisher forecast focusing on the CO(1-0) rotational line targeted by the COMAP survey and a wider, shallower hypothetical iteration. We consider a generalized phenomenological non-CDM model, models with axion dark matter, and local primordial non-Gaussianity, to highlight where a combined analysis of the power spectrum and VID can be most useful. Our results demonstrate improvements in sensitivity to beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics over analyses using either the power spectrum or VID on their own, by factors ranging from 2 to 50, showcasing the potential of joint analyses in unlocking new insights into fundamental physics with LIM surveys.</description>

Abstract: We present a construction of the reaction amplitude for the inclusive production of a resonance decaying to a pair of identical vector particles such as $J/\psi J/\psi$, $\rho\rho$, $\phi\phi$. The method provides the possibility of determining the spin and parity of a resonance in a model-independent way. The methodology is demonstrated using the Standard Model decay of the Higgs boson to four leptons and through angular correlations in the production and decays of $J/\psi$ pairs.</description>

      <title>The oblique parameters in the 2HDM with Vector-Like Quarks: Confronting $M_W$ CDF-II Anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CDF collaboration has released a new measurement of the $W$ boson mass using their complete data set with 8.8 fb$^{-1}$ in $p\bar{p}$ collisions. This result deviates from the Standard Model prediction by around 7$\sigma$. We explain how the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with vector-like quarks is affected by the recently discovered W boson mass. In our study, we include both theoretical constraints such as perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability as well as a number of experimental constraints. We also look into how the effective mixing angle, measured by the SLD collaboration in addition to the CDF W-boson mass, is used to determine the $S$ and $T$ parameters. In the alignment limit, we investigate the case where the lighter CP-even neutral Higgs boson of the 2HDM is the one found at the LHC and demonstrate how the parameter space of the 2HDM type II in the presence of vector-like quarks is constrained. It is found that in most cases, there is a cancellation between the 2HDM and vector-like quarks contributions, which enlarges the parameter space of both models.</description>

      <title>Dissociation cross sections of $\psi (3770)$, $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ mesons with nucleons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dissociation of $\psi (3770)$, $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ mesons in collisions with nucleons, which takes place in high-energy proton-nucleus collisions. Quark interchange between a nucleon and a $c\bar c$ meson leads to the dissociation of the $c\bar c$ meson. We consider the reactions: $pR \to \Lambda_c^+ \bar{D}^0$, $pR \to \Lambda_c^+ \bar{D}^{*0}$, $pR \to \Sigma_c^{++} D^-$, $pR \to \Sigma_c^{++} D^{*-}$, $pR \to \Sigma_c^{+} \bar{D}^0$, $pR \to \Sigma_c^{+} \bar{D}^{*0}$, $pR \to \Sigma_c^{*++} D^-$, $pR \to \Sigma_c^{*++} D^{*-}$, $pR \to \Sigma_c^{*+} \bar{D}^0$, and $pR \to \Sigma_c^{*+} \bar{D}^{*0}$, where $R$ stands for $\psi (3770)$, $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, or $\psi (4415)$. A reaction of a neutron and a $c\bar c$ meson corresponds to a reaction of a proton and the $c\bar c$ meson by replacing the up quark with the down quark and vice versa. Transition-amplitude formulas are derived from the $S$-matrix element. Unpolarized cross sections are calculated with the transition amplitudes for scattering in the prior form and in the post form. The cross sections relate to nodes in the radial wave functions of $\psi (3770)$, $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ mesons.</description>

      <title>Electric Dipole Moments as Probes of $B$ Anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurements of the lepton flavor universality (LFU) in $\mathcal{B}({\,\overline{\!B}} \to D^{(\ast)} l \overline{\nu})$ indicate a significant deviation from the standard model prediction at a 3--4 $\sigma$ level, revealing a violation of the LFU ($R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly). It is known that the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly can be easily accommodated by an $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector leptoquark (LQ) coupled primarily to third-generation fermions, whose existence is further motivated by a partial gauge unification. In general, such a LQ naturally leads to additional $CP$-violating phases in the LQ interactions. In this Letter, we point out that the current $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly prefers the $CP$-violating interaction although $\mathcal{B}({\,\overline{\!B}} \to D^{(\ast)} l\overline{\nu})$ are $CP$-conserving observables. The $CP$-violating LQ predicts a substantial size of the bottom-quark electric dipole moment (EDM), the chromo-EDM, and also the tau-lepton EDM. Eventually at low energy, the nucleon and electron EDMs are radiatively induced. Therefore, we conclude that the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly with the $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector LQ provides unique predictions: neutron and proton EDMs with opposite signs and a magnitude of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-27})\,e\,$cm, and suppressed electron EDM. We also show that the similar EDM pattern is predicted in an $SU(2)_L$-doublet scalar LQ scenario. These EDMs could serve as crucial indicators in future experiments.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the Migdal effect in reactor CE$\nu$NS experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) using reactor antineutrinos represents a formidable experimental challenge, recently boosted by the observation of such a process at the Dresden-II reactor site using a germanium detector. This observation relies on an unexpected enhancement at low energies of the measured quenching factor with respect to the theoretical Lindhard model prediction, which implies an extra observable ionization signal produced after the nuclear recoil. A possible explanation for this additional contribution could be provided by the so-called Migdal effect, which however has never been observed. Here, we study in detail the impact of the Migdal contribution to the standard CE$\nu$NS signal calculated with the Lindhard quenching factor, finding that the former is completely negligible for observed energies below $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{keV}$ where the signal is detectable, and thus unable to provide any contribution to CE$\nu$NS searches in this energy regime. To this purpose, we compare different formalisms used to describe the Migdal effect that intriguingly show a perfect agreement, making our findings robust.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for identifying $H\rightarrow WW^* \rightarrow \ell \nu j j$ in the presence of large Standard Model backgrounds and illustrate how this decay mode may be applied to the study of Bell-type Inequalities. Our findings reveal the feasibility of complete reconstruction of such Higgs decays and the efficacy of our suggested combination of selection criteria in effectively mitigating the otherwise overwhelming backgrounds. Our approach is based on a combination of bottom and charm tagging, alongside innovative reconstruction techniques. A realistic simulation based on publicly available object identification, reconstruction, and tagging efficiencies from the ATLAS experiment is used to explore the potential sensitivity to violations of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality in existing and expected future data collected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is found that, the proposed method provides a powerful means of distinguishing the Higgs decay mode from the background, allowing us to achieve an expectation of approximately 3$\sigma$ significance in detecting violations of these inequalities with 300 $fb^{-1}$ of data, soon-to-be collected by LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects of probing the doubly-charged scalars of the minimal Left-Right Symmetric model (MLRSM) at a muon collider. We assess its capability by studying the production of doubly-charged scalars and their subsequent decay into four charged lepton final states containing the same-charge lepton pairs. We find that the channels with same-charge electron and muon pairs, i.e., ($e^{\pm}e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\mu^{\mp}$ and its charge conjugated pairs), have the largest sensitivity due to the lowest Standard Model background. Besides, we show that the possibility of using fully polarized initial muon beams in the muon collider can enhance the detection sensitivity of doubly-charged scalars of the MLRSM. Furthermore, we show that one can put exclusion limits on the magnitudes of triplet Yukawa couplings that are directly related to the neutrino sector of the MLRSM for the mass range $1.1-5$ TeV of the doubly-charged scalars.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the PTA nHZ gravitational waves from domain walls in next-to minimal supersymmetric standard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With some explicitly $Z_3$ breaking terms in the NMSSM effective superpotential and scalar potential, domain walls (DWs) from spontaneously breaking of the discrete symmetry in approximate $Z_3$-invariant NMSSM can collapse and lead to observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background signals. In the presence of a hidden sector, such terms may originate from the geometric superconformal breaking with holomorphic quadratic correction to frame function when the global scale-invariant superpotential is naturally embedded into the canonical superconformal supergravity models. The smallness of such mass parameters in the NMSSM may be traced back to the original superconformal invariance. Naive estimations indicate that a SUSY explanation to muon $g-2$ anomaly can have tension with the constraints on SUSY by PTA data, because large SUSY contributions to $\Delta a_\mu$ in general needs relatively light superpartners while present $\Omega_{gw}^0$ can set the lower bounds for $m_{soft}$. We calculate numerically the signatures of GW produced from the collapse of DWs and find that the observed nHZ stochastic GW background by NANOGrav, etc., can indeed be explained with proper tiny values of $\chi m_{3/2}\sim 10^{-14}{\rm eV}$ for $\chi S^2$ case (and $\chi m_{3/2}\sim 10^{-10}{\rm eV}$ for $\chi H_u H_d$ case), respectively. Besides, there are still some parameter points, whose GW spectra intersect with the NANOGrav signal region, that can explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly to $1\sigma$ range.</description>

      <title>Study on the sensitivity of the Higgs boson couplings in photon-photon collision at CLIC and muon collider</title>

Abstract: In a model-independent way, we explore the potential of photon-induced interactions with the process $\gamma^* \gamma^* \rightarrow ZZ$ to investigate CP-conserving and CP-violating dimension-six operators of Higgs-gauge boson couplings using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The existence of anomalous $H\gamma\gamma$ and $HZZ$ couplings is discussed at 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) and 10 TeV Muon Collider (MuC) with integrated luminosities of 5 and 10 ab$^{-1}$, respectively. All signal and relevant background events are generated in MadGraph and passed through PYTHIA for parton showering and hadronization. The detector effects are evaluated using CLIC and MuC detector cards tuned in Delphes. We report the 95% confidence level limits on the Wilson coefficients $\overline{c}_\gamma$, $\overline{c}_{HB}$, $\overline{c}_{HW}$, $\widetilde{c}_\gamma$, $\widetilde{c}_{HB}$, and $\widetilde{c}_{HW}$ and compare them with the experimental and phenomenological limits.</description>

      <title>Rescuing Gravitational-Reheating in Chaotic Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show, within the single-field inflationary paradigm, that a linear non-minimal interaction $\xi\,M_P\,\phi\,R$ between the inflaton field $\phi$ and the Ricci scalar $R$ can result in successful inflation that concludes with an efficient heating of the Universe via perturbative decays of the inflaton, aided entirely by gravity. Considering the inflaton field to oscillate in a quadratic potential, we find that $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}) \lesssim \xi \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^2)$ is required to satisfy the observational bounds from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Interestingly, the upper bound on the non-minimal coupling guarantees a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \gtrsim 10^{-4}$, within the range of current and future planned experiments. We also discuss implications of dark matter production, along with the potential generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry resulting from inflaton decay, through the same gravity portal.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis of the top-quark pair production via the $e^+ e^-$ annihilation near the threshold region up to N$^3$LO QCD corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an improved analysis of the top-quark pair production via the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to \gamma^{*}\to t\bar{t}$ near the threshold region up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) QCD corrections. Near the threshold region, the top-quark velocity $v$ tends to zero, leading to Coulomb singularity. To achieve a reasonable prediction in the threshold region, we reconstruct the analytical expression for the Coulomb-terms up to N$^{3}$LO accuracy by using the PSLQ algorithm, whose numerical values agree well with the previous N$^3$LO-level calculations. It is found that the N$^{3}$LO series still has sizable renormalization scale dependence, and to improve the precision of the series, we apply the Principle of Maximum Conformality to eliminate such scale dependence. After that, the Coulomb part is resummed into a Sommerfeld-Gamow-Sakharov factor, which finally leads to a much more reasonable behavior near the threshold region.</description>

      <title>Semi-inclusive production of spin-3/2 hadrons in deep inelastic scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of spin-3/2 hadrons in semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scatterings. The complete differential cross section is derived through the kinematic analysis and expressed in terms of 288 structure functions, corresponding to all polarization configurations and azimuthal modulations. For an unpolarized lepton beam, half of the 192 structure functions have nonzero leading order contributions in the parton model, among which 42 are from rank-3 tensor polarized fragmentation functions of the hadron. For a polarized lepton beam, one third of the 96 structure functions contribute at the leading order and 14 of them are from rank-3 tensor polarized fragmentation functions. In addition to the formalism, we perform a model estimation of the spin transfer to a $S_{hLLL}$ polarized hadron and sizable asymmetry is expected. Therefore, these newly defined observables for the production of a spin-3/2 hadron in a deep inelastic scattering process can be explored in future experiments to understand nucleon spin structures and spin-dependent fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>On the breakdown of eikonal approximation and survival of Reggeization in presence of dimension-5 Higgs-gluon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the one-loop effective vertex for the interaction of a gluon with a Reggeized gluon and a Higgs boson in the infinite-top-mass limit, which is described by a dimension-5 non-renormalizable operator. This vertex enters the calculation of differential cross sections for the forward inclusive production of a Higgs boson in high-energy proton-proton collisions, possibly in association with a backward jet or identified hadron, in a framework where next-to-leading logarithms of the energy are resummed to all orders. The effective vertex is extracted from the high-energy behavior of two-to-two amplitudes for the Higgs production in parton-parton collisions and relies on the validity of the Regge form for these amplitudes. We find that the usual eikonal approximation (Gribov prescription) for the Regge limit and the known region-expansion technique in this limit lead to an incomplete result for the amplitude. The discrepancy is traced back to the non-renormalizable nature of the involved operator. However, the Regge limit of the exact QCD amplitude agrees with the Regge-pole exchange form at one loop, nontrivially supporting the Reggeization hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in Multiple Isotopes for Fingerprints Identification of Operators and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the most promising way to determine whether neutrinos are Majorana particles. There are many experiments based on different isotopes searching for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Combining the searches of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in multiple isotopes provides a possible method to distinguish operators and different models. The contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay come from standard, long-range, and short-range mechanisms. We analyze the scenario in which the standard and short-range operators exist simultaneously within the framework of low-energy effective field theory. Five specific models are considered, which can realize neutrino mass and can contribute to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay via multiple mechanisms. A criterion to evaluate the possibilities of future experiments to discriminate operators and models is built. We find that the complementary searches for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in different isotopes can distinguish the cases that contain the low-energy effective operators $\mathcal{O}_{1,2,5}$ and R-parity violating supersymmetry model. For other cases and models, the experimental searches within multiple isotopes can also more effectively constrain the parameter region than with only one isotope.</description>

      <title>Photon quantum kinetic equations and collective modes in an axion background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quantum kinetic theory for photons in the presence of an axion background and in the collisioness limit. In deriving the classical regime of our quantum kinetic equations, we observe that they capture well known features of axion electrodynamics. By projecting the Wigner function onto a polarization basis, relating the Wigner matrix function with the Stokes parameters, we establish the dispersion relations and transport equations for each polarization space component. Additionally, we investigate how the axion background affects the dispersion relations of photon collective modes within an electron-positron plasma at equilibrium temperature $T$. While the plasmon remains unaffected, we find that the axion background breaks the degeneracy of transverse collective modes at order $e g_{a\gamma}T(\partial a)$, where $e$ represents the electron charge, $ g_{a\gamma}$ denotes the photon-axion coupling, and $\partial a$ represents the scale associated with variations in the axion field.</description>

      <title>New method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation: Estimation of the weights of $C$, $P$ and $CP$ symmetry violating terms in positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors of light nuclei are evaluated up to momenta of the order of the nucleon mass, using the impulse approximation. The nucleon gravitational form factors are reduced non-relativistically, and used to derive the gravitational form factors of light nuclei. The deuteron gravitational form factors are analysed using the Reid soft core potential. The helium-4 gravitational form factors are assessed using the K-harmonics method, and compared to those following from a mean-field approximation with a Woods-Saxon potential. The importance of removing the center of mass motion for the ensuing form factors is emphasized. The mass radii of these light nuclei are extracted and compared to their charge radii counterparts. The details of their pressure and shear distributions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Precise Cosmological Constraints from BOSS Galaxy Clustering with a Simulation-Based Emulator of the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a reanalysis of the BOSS CMASS DR12 galaxy dataset using a simulation-based emulator for the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) coefficients. Moving beyond our previous works, which laid the foundation for the first galaxy clustering application of this estimator, we construct a neural net-based emulator for the cosmological dependence of the WST coefficients and the 2-point correlation function multipoles, trained from the state-of-the-art suite of \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulations combined with a flexible Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) galaxy model. In order to confirm the accuracy of our pipeline, we subject it to a series of thorough internal and external mock parameter recovery tests, before applying it to reanalyze the CMASS observations in the redshift range $0.46&lt;z&lt;0.57$. We find that a joint WST + 2-point correlation function likelihood analysis allows us to obtain marginalized 1$\sigma$ errors on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are tighter by a factor of $2.5-6$, compared to the 2-point correlation function, and by a factor of $1.4-2.5$ compared to the WST-only results. This corresponds to a competitive $0.9\%$, $2.3\%$ and $1\%$ level of determination for parameters $\omega_c$, $\sigma_8$ $\&amp;$ $n_s$, respectively, and also to a $0.7\%$ $\&amp;$ $2.5 \%$ constraint on derived parameters h and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, in agreement with the \textit{Planck} 2018 results. Our results reaffirm the constraining power of the WST and highlight the exciting prospect of employing higher-order statistics in order to fully exploit the power of upcoming Stage-IV spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>Baryon density dependence of viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma at hadronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\phi$ meson and $\Omega$ baryon provide unique probes of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at hadronization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using the quark recombination model with the quark phase-space information parameterized in a viscous blastwave, we perform Bayesian inference of the shear and bulk viscosities of the QGP at hadronization with a temperature of $T\sim 160$ MeV by analyzing the $\phi$ and $\Omega$ data in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 19.6-200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV, corresponding to a baryon chemical potential variation from $\mu_B\approx 0$ (at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 2.76$ TeV) to $200$ MeV (at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 19.6$ GeV). We find that the shear viscosity to enthalpy ratio $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)$ of the QGP at hadronization decreases as $\mu_B$ increases, with $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)\approx 0.18$ at $\mu_B=0$ and $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)\approx 0.08$ at $\mu_B=200$ MeV, while the corresponding specific bulk viscosity is essentially constant with $\zeta T/(\epsilon + P)=0.02\sim 0.04$ for $\mu_B&lt;200$ MeV. Our results suggest that the QGP at hadronization ($T\sim 160$ MeV) with finite baryon density is more close to perfect fluid than that with zero baryon density.</description>

      <title>Core and Halo Properties in Multi-Field Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute multi-field core and halo properties in wave Dark Matter models. We focus on the case where Dark Matter consists of two light (real) scalars, interacting gravitationally. As in the single-field Ultra Light Dark Matter (ULDM) case, the scalar field behaves as a coherent BEC with a definite ground state (at fixed total mass), often referred to in the literature as a gravitational soliton. We establish an efficient algorithm to find the ground and excited states of such two-field systems. We then use simulations to investigate the gravitational collapse and virialization, starting from different initial conditions, into solitons and surrounding halo. As in the single-field case, a virialized halo forms with a gravitational soliton (ground state) at the center. We find some evidence for an empirical relation between the soliton mass and energy and those of the host halo. We use this to then find a numerical relation between the properties of the two. Finally, we use this to address the issue of alleviating some of the tensions that single-field ULDM has with observational data, in particular, the issue of how a galaxy's core and radius are related. We find that if galaxies of different masses have similar percentages of the two species, then the core-radius scaling tension is not addressed. However, more general possibilities occur if the relative abundance of species in each halo correlates with the total mass of the galaxy. If this is the case, the model predicts several other phenomenological signatures.</description>

      <title>Quark structure of isoscalar- and isovector-scalar mesons and nuclear matter property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was found that the isoscalar-scalar and isovector-scalar mesons play significant roles in nuclear matter physics. However, the underlying structures of these resonances are not yet well understood. We construct a three-flavor baryonic extended linear sigma model including both the two- and four-quark constitutes of scalar mesons with respect to the axial transformation and study the nuclear matter properties with relativistic mean field method. The nuclear matter properties at saturation density and hadron spectrums are well reproduced with this model simultaneously and, only the two-quark component of the scalar mesons couple to baryon fields and dominates the nuclear force. A plateau-like structure is found in the symmetry energy of nuclear matter due to the multi-meson couplings, and it's crucial for understanding the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}\rm Pb$ and the tidal deformation of neutron star from GW170817. At high density regions, the vector mesons are found to be rather crucial, especially the ones coupling with four-quark configurations. This model can be easily extended to study neutron stars, even with hyperons in their interior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive constraints on the four dimensional energy-momentum tensor from gravitational and gauge anomalies. Our work can be considered an extension of Duff's analysis [1] to include parity-odd terms and explicit symmetry breaking. The constraints imply the absence of the parity-odd $R\tilde R$ and $F\tilde F$ terms, for theories whose symmetries are compatible with dimensional regularisation, in a model-independent way. Remarkably, even in the case of explicit symmetry breaking the $\Box R$-anomaly is found to be finite and unambiguous after applying the symmetry constraints. We compute mixed gravity-gauge anomalies at leading order and deduce phenomenological consequences for vector bosons associated with global chiral symmetries.</description>

Abstract: In this lecture we discuss the properties of dense hadronic matter inside neutron stars. In particular, we pay attention to the role of strangeness in the core of neutron stars, by analysing the presence of baryons and mesons with strangeness. We consider two interesting possible scenarios in their interior, that is, the existence of hyperons leading to the so-called hyperon puzzle and the presence of a kaon condensed phase inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Real-time scattering in the lattice Schwinger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods have demonstrated their suitability for the study of equilibrium properties of lattice gauge theories, even close to the continuum limit. We use them in an out-of-equilibrium scenario, much less explored so far, by simulating the real-time collisions of composite mesons in the lattice Schwinger model. Constructing wave-packets of vector mesons at different incoming momenta, we observe the opening of the inelastic channel in which two heavier mesons are produced and identify the momentum threshold. To detect the products of the collision in the strong coupling regime we propose local quantitites that could be measured in current quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>A direct probe of $\Lambda$ potential in nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Li\`{e}ge intranuclear-cascade model together with the ablation model ABLA, an investigation is conducted into the effects of $\Lambda$ potential in $\Lambda$-nucleus and $\Lambda$-hypernucleus-nucleus collisions across various beam energies. The findings show that the angle and transverse-momentum distributions of scattered $\Lambda$ hyperon, the scattering cross section of the $\Lambda$ hyperon in $\Lambda$-nucleus collisions as well as the rapidity distribution of $\Lambda$ hyperon in $\Lambda$-hypernucleus-nucleus collisions are significantly influenced by the strength of the $\Lambda$ potential in these scattering reactions across various beam energies. These demonstrations, unhindered by the uncertainties of $\Lambda$ and hypernuclei productions in nuclear medium, allow for a direct investigation of the $\Lambda$ potential, especially its momentum dependence. The criticality of probing the $\Lambda$ potential is closely associated with the resolution of the "hyperon puzzle" in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Quantum Stress-Energy Tensor for the Kink and sine-Gordon Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized one-loop quantum corrections to the energy density $T_{00}(x)$ and pressure $T_{11}(x)$ for solitons in the $1+1$ dimensional scalar sine-Gordon and kink models. We show how precise implementation of counterterms in dimensional regularization resolves previously identified discrepancies between the integral of $T_{00}(x)$ and the known correction to the total energy.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. When applied to curvature perturbations during inflation this observation closes a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion-Like Particles Dark Matter in Coma Berenices with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) appear in many extensions of the Standard Model and are being investigated as promising dark matter (DM) candidates. One viable methodology for their detection involves the investigation of the line-like radio emissions from the dwarf spheroidal galaxy, potentially originating from the radiative decay of ALPs or the conversion of ALPs in the magnetic field. In this work, we constrain the properties of ALPs using the 2-hour radio observation of Coma Berenices through the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The $\rm 95\%$ upper limits of the ALP-photon coupling are calculated for the ALP decay and conversion scenarios, respectively. Note that the sensitive ALP masses for FAST range from $\sim \mu \rm eV$ to tens of $\mu \rm eV$, where ALP can explain the DM abundance naturally. However, our limits are weaker than those of the CAST helioscope, which can provide an independent and complementary check on the ALP non-detection for ground experiments. Furthermore, we evaluate the expected sensitivity on the ALP of FAST with its full designed bandwidth (70 $\rm MHz$ - 3 $\rm GHz$) for 100 hours of observation time. Our results indicate that, even with the exceptional sensitivity of the FAST, it is challenging to surpass the existing experimental constraints on ALP DM using radio observation of dSphs, unless the possible enhancements of ALP signals by compact stars in dSphs are considered.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain five popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$ indicating a beyond $2\sigma$ evidence of primordial gravitational waves. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrink the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, obtain a $1.3\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy implying that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe, and give a clue of massive sterile neutrinos via the $2\sigma$ constraint on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}=3.16^{+0.26}_{-0.11}$ and the effective mass $m^{eff}_{\nu, sterile}&lt;0.52$ eV. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter, dark energy and neutrinos, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This introductory work combines bottom-up and top-down approaches towards understanding the underlying categorical structure of possible unifying theories descending from string theory. Guided by well-established developments in the realm of categorical algebraic geometry, we explain why abelianisation could potentially lead to furthering the understanding of how to embed Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in supersymmetric setups.</description>
