      <title>Comprehensive Systems for Primary Decompositions of Parametric Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective method for computing parametric primary decomposition via comprehensive Gr\"obner systems. In general, it is very difficult to compute a parametric primary decomposition of a given ideal in the polynomial ring with rational coefficients $\mathbb{Q}[A,X]$ where $A$ is the set of parameters and $X$ is the set of ordinary variables. One cause of the difficulty is related to the irreducibility of the specialized polynomial. Thus, we introduce a new notion of ``feasibility'' on the stability of the structure of the ideal in terms of its primary decomposition, and we give a new algorithm for computing a so-called comprehensive system consisting of pairs $(C, \mathcal{Q})$, where for each parameter value in $C$, the ideal has the stable decomposition $\mathcal{Q}$. We may call this comprehensive system a parametric primary decomposition of the ideal. Also, one can also compute a dense set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\varphi_\alpha(\mathcal{Q})$ is a primary decomposition for any $\alpha\in C\cap \mathcal{O}$ via irreducible polynomials. In addition, we give several computational examples to examine the effectiveness of our new decomposition.</description>

      <title>New Results on Periodic Golay Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide algorithmic methods for conducting exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs. Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond the currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \leq 72$ using our methods, while only lengths $v \leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively enumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in general. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation derived in 2013 by Djokovi\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a new method of "multi-level" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in several steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v \leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences where uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence generation inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of orderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of periodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths $v \lt 100$.</description>
