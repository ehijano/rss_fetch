      <title>Beyond theory driven discovery: hot random search and datum derived structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data driven methods have transformed the prospects of the computational chemical sciences, with machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) speeding up calculations by several orders of magnitude. I reflect on theory driven, as opposed to data driven, discovery based on ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS), and then introduce two methods which exploit machine learning acceleration. I show how long high throughput anneals, between direct structural relaxation, enabled by ephemeral data derived potentials (EDDPs), can be incorporated into AIRSS to bias the sampling of challenging systems towards low energy configurations. Hot AIRSS (hot-AIRSS) preserves the parallel advantage of random search, while allowing much more complex systems to be tackled. This is demonstrated through searches for complex boron structures in large unit cells. I then show how low energy carbon structures can be directly generated from a single, experimentally determined, diamond structure. An extension to the generation of random sensible structures, candidates are stochastically generated and then optimised to minimise the difference between the EDDP environment vector and that of the reference diamond structure. The distance-based cost function is captured in an actively learned EDDP. Graphite, small nanotubes and caged, fullerene-like, structures emerge from searches using this potential, along with a rich variety of tetrahedral framework structures. Using the same approach, the pyrope, Mg$_3$Al$_2$(SiO$_4$)$_3$, garnet structure is recovered from a low energy AIRSS structure generated in a smaller unit cell with a different chemical composition. The relationship of this approach to modern diffusion model based generative methods is discussed.</description>

      <title>Majorana Tensor Decomposition: A unifying framework for decompositions of fermionic Hamiltonians to Linear Combination of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions have appeared as one of the main tools for encoding operators on quantum computers, allowing efficient implementations of arbitrary operators. In particular, LCU approaches present a way of encoding information from the electronic structure Hamiltonian into a quantum circuit. Over the past years, many different decomposition techniques have appeared for the electronic structure Hamiltonian. Here we present the Majorana Tensor Decomposition (MTD), a framework that unifies existing LCUs and offers novel decomposition methods by using popular low-rank tensor factorizations.</description>

      <title>Topologically controlled synthesis of active colloidal bipeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological growth control allows to produce a narrow distribution of outgrown colloidal rods with defined and adjustable length. We use an external magnetic field to assemble paramagnetic colloidal spheres into colloidal rods of a chosen length. The rods reside above ametamorphic hexagonalmagnetic pattern. The periodic repetition of specific loops of the orientation of an applied external field renders paramagnetic colloidal particles and their assemblies into active bipeds that walk on the pattern. The metamorphic patterns allow the robust and controlled polymerization of single colloids to bipeds of a desired length. The colloids are exposed to this fixed external control loop that causes multiple simultaneous responses: Small bipeds and single colloidal particles interpret the external magnetic loop as an order to walk toward the active zone, where they assemble and polymerize. Outgrown bipeds interpret the same loop as an order to walk away from the active zone. The topological transition occurs solely for the growing biped and nothing is changed in the environment nor in the magnetic control loop. As in many biological systems the decision of a biped that reached its outgrown length to walk away from the reaction site is made internally, not externally.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of reaction coordinate based rate theories for modelling chemical reactions: insights from the thermal isomerization in retinal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern potential energy surfaces have shifted attention to molecular simulations of chemical reactions. While various methods can estimate rate constants for conformational transitions in molecular dynamics simulations, their applicability to studying chemical reactions remains uncertain due to the high and sharp energy barriers and complex reaction coordinates involved. This study focuses on the thermal cis-trans isomerization in retinal, employing molecular simulations and comparing rate constant estimates based on one-dimensional rate theories with those based on sampling transitions and grid-based models for low-dimensional collective variable spaces. Even though each individual method to estimate the rate passes its quality tests, the rate constant estimates exhibit disparities of up to four orders of magnitude. Rate constant estimates based on one-dimensional reaction coordinates prove challenging to converge, even if the reaction coordinate is optimized. However, consistent estimates of the rate constant are achieved by sampling transitions and by multi-dimensional grid-based models.</description>
