      <title>Arithmetic properties of families of plane polynomial automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an algebraic family $f\colon\Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2 \to \Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2$ of plane polynomial automorphisms of H\'enon type parameterized by a quasi-projective curve, defined over a number field $\mathbb{K}$, we study the number of periodic points contained in a family of subvarieties $Y\subset \Lambda \times \mathbb{A}^2 \to \Lambda$. Under some mild conditions (e.g., when the family is dissipative), we show that there are only finitely many periodic points contained in a non periodic marked point. This generalizes a result of Charles Favre and Romain Dujardin. We also show that there is a uniform bound on the number of periodic points in a family of curves $Y_t, t\in \Lambda$, when $Y$ is non-degenerate. Then we study in more details the case of dissipative families of quadratic H\'enon maps.</description>

      <title>Extended invariant cones as Nonlinear Normal Modes of inhomogeneous piecewise linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between invariant cones and nonlinear normal modes in piecewise linear mechanical systems. As a key result, we extend the invariant cone concept, originally established for homogeneous piecewise linear systems, to a class of inhomogeneous continuous piecewise linear systems. The inhomogeneous terms can be constant and/or time-dependent, modeling nonsmooth mechanical systems with a clearance gap and external harmonic forcing, respectively. Using an augmented state vector, a modified invariant cone problem is formulated and solved to compute the nonlinear normal modes, understood as periodic solutions of the underlying conservative dynamics. An important contribution is that the invariant cones of the underlying homogeneous system can be regarded as a singularity in the theory of nonlinear normal modes of continuous piecewise linear systems. In addition, we use a similar methodology to take external harmonic forcing into account. We illustrate our approach using numerical examples. The resulting backbone curves and frequency response diagrams are compared to the results obtained using the shooting method and brute force time integration.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing with the Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing aims to achieve high-performance and low-cost machine learning with a dynamical system as a reservoir. However, in general, there are almost no theoretical guidelines for its high-performance or optimality. This paper focuses on the reservoir computing with the Kuramoto model and theoretically reveals its approximation ability. The main result provides an explicit expression of the dynamics of the Kuramoto reservoir by using the order parameters. Thus, the output of the reservoir computing is expressed as a linear combination of the order parameters. As a corollary, sufficient conditions on hyperparameters are obtained so that the set of the order parameters gives the complete basis of the Lebesgue space. This implies that the Kuramoto reservoir has a universal approximation property. Furthermore, the conjecture on {\it the edge of bifurcation}, which is a generalization of the famous criterion {\it the edge of chaos} for designing a high-performance reservoir, is also discussed from the viewpoint of its approximation ability. It is numerically demonstrated by a prediction task and a transformation task.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of orthogonal projections of self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ be a self similar measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$, and let $\pi$ be an orthogonal projection onto a $k$-dimensional subspace. We formulate a criterion on the action of the group generated by the orthogonal parts of the IFS on $\pi$, and show that it ensures the dimension of $\pi \nu$ is preserved; this significantly refines previous results by Hochman-Shmerkin (2012) and Falconer-Jin (2014), and is sharp for projections to lines and hyperplanes. A key ingredient in the proof is an application of a restricted projection theorem of Gan-Guo-Wang (2024).</description>

      <title>Quadratic differentials and function theory on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite-area holomorphic quadratic differentials on an arbitrary Riemann surface $X=\mathbb{H}/\Gamma$ is uniquely determined by its horizontal measured foliation. By extending our prior result for $\Gamma$ of the first kind to arbitrary Fuchsian group $\Gamma$, we obtain that a measured foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is realized by the horizontal foliation of a finite-area holomorphic quadratic differential on $X$ if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ has finite Dirichlet integral. We determine the image of this correspondence when the infinite Riemann surface has bounded geometry -- an extension of the realization result of Hubbard and Masur for compact surfaces. A corollary is that a planar surface $X$ with bounded pants decomposition and with (at most) countably many ends is parabolic, i.e., does not support Green's function, in notation $X\in O_G$ where $G$ is Green's function. The class of harmonic functions with finite Dirichlet integral is denoted by $HD$. We give a geometric proof that the class $O_{HD}$ of the Riemann surfaces (that do not support non-constant $HD$-functions) is invariant under quasiconformal maps. Lyons proved that the $O_{HB}$ class (surfaces that do not support non-constant bounded harmonic functions) is not invariant under quasiconformal maps, and it is well-known that the $O_G$ class is invariant. Therefore, the noninvariant class $O_{HB}$ is between two invariant classes: $O_G\subset O_{HB}\subset O_{HD}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish three variational principles for the upper metric mean dimension with potential of level sets of continuous maps in terms of the entropy of partitions and Katok's entropy of the underlying system. Our results hold for dynamical systems exhibiting the specification property. Moreover, we apply our results to study the metric mean dimension of suspension flows.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff sum convergence of Fr\'echet observables to stable laws for Gibbs-Markov systems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a Poisson point process approach to prove distributional convergence to a stable law for non square-integrable observables $\phi: [0,1]\to R$, mostly of the form $\phi (x) = d(x,x_0)^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}$,$0&lt;\alpha\le 2$, on Gibbs-Markov maps. A key result is to verify a standard mixing condition, which ensures that large values of the observable dominate the time-series, in the range $1&lt;\alpha \le 2$. Stable limit laws for observables on dynamical systems have been established in two settings: ``good observables'' (typically H\"older) on slowly mixing non-uniformly hyperbolic systems and ``bad'' observables (unbounded with fat tails) on fast mixing dynamical systems. As an application we investigate the interplay between these two effects in a class of intermittent-type maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of Anosov diffeomorphisms on complete open surfaces. We show that under the assumptions of density of periodic points and uniform geometry that such diffeomorphisms have a system of Margulis measures, which are a holonomy invariant and dynamically invariant system of measures along the stable and unstable leaves. This shows that there can be no such diffeomorphism with a global product structure.</description>

      <title>Real analytic nonexpansive maps on polyhedral normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a real analytic nonexpansive map on a polyhedral normed space has a nonempty fixed point set, then we show that there is an isometry from an affine subspace onto the fixed point set. As a corollary, we prove that for any real analytic 1-norm or $\infty$-norm nonexpansive map on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a positive integer $q$ such that the period of any periodic orbit divides $q$ and $q$ is the order, or twice the order, of a permutation on $n$ letters. This confirms Nussbaum's $2^n$ Conjecture for $\infty$-norm nonexpansive maps in the special case where the maps are also real analytic.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dynamical systems as zero-noise limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamical system may be defined by a simple transition law - such as a map or a vector field. Most learning techniques primarily try to recreate the dynamic evolution law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. One of the major theoretical challenges for numerical methods is that approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as a Markov process. The procedure is completely data-driven. The technique is proved to be convergent -- the stationary density of the Markov process has a support that converges to the targeted invariant set. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions of stochastic stability of the targeted system, the technique is also shown to provide a convergent statistical approximation.</description>

      <title>Uncountable Infinite Exact Solutions to the FitzHugh-Nagumo Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First time in six decades, uncountable infinite exact solutions of FitzHugh-Nagumo model with diffusion have been found. FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a nonlinear dynamical system applicable to neurosciences, chemical kinetics, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, epidemiology, cardiac physiology and pattern formation. Non-classical symmetry analysis has been carried out to find invariant solutions. In many ways this finding makes the corpus of asymptotics and numerics obsolete. Non singular, physically stable and meaningful solutions could now be found without distorting the actual model or introducing forced conditions.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and "Burgulence" in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of initial long-wavelength excitations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain has been the subject of intense investigations since the pioneering work of Fermi and collaborators. We have recently found a new regime where the spectrum of the Fourier modes decays with a power-law and we have interpreted this regime as a transient turbulence associated with the Burgers equation. In this paper we present the full derivation of the latter equation from the lattice dynamics using a newly developed infinite dimensional Hamiltonian perturbation theory. This theory allows us to relate the time evolution of the Fourier spectrum $E_k$ of the Burgers equation to the one of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain. As a consequence, we derive analytically both the shock time and the power-law $-8/3$ of the spectrum at this time. Using the shock time as a unit, we follow numerically the time-evolution of the spectrum and observe the persistence of the power $-2$ over an extensive time window. The exponent $-2$ has been widely discussed in the literature on the Burgers equation. The analysis of the Burgers equation in Fourier space also gives information on the time evolution of the energy of each single mode which, at short time, is also a power-law depending on the $k$-th wavenumber $E_k \sim t^{2k-2}$. This approach to the FPUT dynamics opens the way to a wider study of scaling regimes arising from more general initial conditions.</description>

Abstract: We give a tree structure on the set of all periodic directions on the golden L, which gives an associated tree structure on the set of periodic directions for the pentagon billiard table and double pentagon surface. We use this to give the periods of periodic directions on the pentagon and double pentagon. We also show examples of many periodic billiard trajectories on the pentagon, which are strikingly beautiful, and we describe some of their properties. Finally, we give conjectures and future directions based on experimental computer evidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of measurable pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms of surfaces, a generalization of Thurston's pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. A measurable pseudo-Anosov map has a transverse pair of full measure turbulations consisting of streamlines which are dense immersed lines: these turbulations are equipped with measures which are expanded and contracted uniformly by the homeomorphism. The turbulations need not have a good product structure anywhere, but have some local structure imposed by the existence of tartans: bundles of unstable and stable streamline segments which intersect regularly, and on whose intersections the product of the measures on the turbulations agrees with the ambient measure. We prove that measurable pseudo-Anosov maps are transitive, have dense periodic points, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and are ergodic with respect to the ambient measure. Measurable pseudo-Anosovs maps were introduced in [11], where we constructed a parameterized family of non-conjugate examples on the sphere.</description>

Abstract: Let $S$ be a compact surface of genus $\geq 2$ equipped with a metric that is flat everywhere except at finitely many cone points with angles greater than $2\pi$. We examine the geodesic flow on $S$ and prove local product structure for a wide class of equilibrium states. Using this, we establish the Bernoulli property for these systems. We also establish local product structure for a similar class of equilibrium states for geodesic flows on rank 1, nonpositively curved manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ be a generalized affine fractal interpolation function with vertical scaling functions. In this paper, we prove the monotonicity of spectral radii of vertical scaling matrices without additional assumptions. We also obtain the irreducibility of these matrices under certain conditions. By these results, we estimate $\mathrm{dim}_B \Gamma f$, the box dimension of the graph of $f$, by the limits of spectral radii of vertical scaling matrices. We also estimate $\mathrm{dim}_B \Gamma f$ directly by the sum function of vertical scaling functions. As an application, we study the box dimension of the graph of a generalized Weierstrass-type function.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Training via a Correlated Dynamics Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As neural networks grow in scale, their training becomes both computationally demanding and rich in dynamics. Amidst the flourishing interest in these training dynamics, we present a novel observation: Parameters during training exhibit intrinsic correlations over time. Capitalizing on this, we introduce Correlation Mode Decomposition (CMD). This algorithm clusters the parameter space into groups, termed modes, that display synchronized behavior across epochs. This enables CMD to efficiently represent the training dynamics of complex networks, like ResNets and Transformers, using only a few modes. Moreover, test set generalization is enhanced. We introduce an efficient CMD variant, designed to run concurrently with training. Our experiments indicate that CMD surpasses the state-of-the-art method for compactly modeled dynamics on image classification. Our modeling can improve training efficiency and lower communication overhead, as shown by our preliminary experiments in the context of federated learning.</description>

Abstract: As an analogue of topological boundary of discrete groups $\Gamma$, we define the noncommutative topological boundary of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M,\tau)$ and apply it to generalize the main results of [AHO23], showing that for a trace preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright(A,\tau_A)$ on an amenable tracial von Neumann algebra, a $\Gamma$-invariant measure $\mu\in\mathrm{Prob}(\mathrm{SA}(\Gamma\ltimes A))$ supported on amenable intermediate subalgebras between $A$ and $\Gamma\ltimes A$ is necessary supported on the subalgebras of $\mathrm{Rad}(\Gamma)\ltimes A$. By taking $(A,\tau)=L^\infty(X,\nu_X)$ for a free p.m.p. action $\Gamma \curvearrowright(X,\nu_X)$, we obtain a similar results for the invariant random subequivalence relations of $\mathcal{R}_{\Gamma \curvearrowright X}$.</description>
