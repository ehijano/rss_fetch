      <title>On the Complexity of the Ordered Covering Problem in Distance Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ordered Covering Problem (OCP) arises in the context of the Discretizable Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (DMDGP), where the ordering of pruning edges significantly impacts the performance of the SBBU algorithm for protein structure determination. In recent work, Souza et al. (2023) formalized OCP as a hypergraph covering problem with ordered, exponential costs, and proposed a greedy heuristic that outperforms the original SBBU ordering by orders of magnitude. However, the computational complexity of finding optimal solutions remained open. In this paper, we prove that OCP is NP-complete through a polynomial-time reduction from the strongly NP-complete 3-Partition problem. Our reduction constructs a tight budget that forces optimal solutions to correspond exactly to valid 3-partitions. This result establishes a computational barrier for optimal edge ordering and provides theoretical justification for the heuristic approaches currently used in practice.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Local Search for CSPs Parameterized by Constraint Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of local search, whose goal is to find a good nearby solution from the given current solution. Formally, given an optimization problem where the goal is to find the largest feasible subset $S$ of a universe $U$, the new input consists of a current solution $P$ (not necessarily feasible) as well as an ordinary input for the problem.
  Given the existence of a feasible solution $S^*$, the goal is to find a feasible solution as good as $S^*$ in parameterized time $f(k) \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $k$ denotes the distance $|P\Delta S^*|$. This model generalizes numerous classical parameterized optimization problems whose parameter $k$ is the minimum number of elements removed from $U$ to make it feasible, which corresponds to the case $P = U$.
  We apply this model to widely studied Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), where $U$ is the set of constraints, and a subset $U'$ of constraints is feasible if there is an assignment to the variables satisfying all constraints in $U'$. We give a complete characterization of the parameterized complexity of all boolean-alphabet symmetric CSPs, where the predicate's acceptance depends on the number of true literals.</description>

      <title>Fast approximate $\ell$-center clustering in high dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of efficient approximation algorithms for the
  $\ell$-center clustering and minimum-diameter $\ell$-clustering
  problems in high dimensional Euclidean and Hamming spaces. Our main
  tool is randomized dimension reduction. First, we present a general
  method of reducing the dependency of the running time of a
  hypothetical algorithm for the $\ell$-center problem in a high
  dimensional Euclidean space on the dimension size. Utilizing in
  part this method, we provide $(2+\epsilon)$- approximation
  algorithms for the $\ell$-center clustering and minimum-diameter
  $\ell$-clustering problems in Euclidean and Hamming spaces that are
  substantially faster than the known $2$-approximation ones when both
  $\ell$ and the dimension are super-logarithmic. Next, we apply the
  general method to the recent fast approximation algorithms with
  higher approximation guarantees for the $\ell$-center clustering
  problem in a high dimensional Euclidean space. Finally, we provide a
  speed-up of the known $O(1)$-approximation method for the
  generalization of the $\ell$-center clustering problem to include
  $z$ outliers (i.e., $z$ input points can be ignored while computing
  the maximum distance of an input point to a center) in high
  dimensional Euclidean and Hamming spaces.</description>

      <title>Singing a MIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a broadcast model called the singing model, where agents are oblivious of the size and structure of the communication network, even their immediate neighborhood. Agents can sing multiple notes which are heard by their neighbors. The model is a generalization of the beeping model, where agents can only emit sound at a single frequency. We give a simple and natural protocol where agents compete with their neighbors and their strength is reflected in the number of notes they sing. It converges in $O(log(n))$ time with high probability, where $n$ is the number of agents in the network. The protocol works in an asynchronous model where rounds vary in length and have different start times. It works with completely dynamic networks where agents can be faulty. The protocol is the first to converge to an MIS in logarithmic time for dynamic networks in a network oblivious model.</description>

      <title>Comparative algorithm performance evaluation and prediction for the maximum clique problem using instance space analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum clique problem, a well-known graph-based combinatorial optimization problem, has been addressed through various algorithmic approaches, though systematic analyses of the problem instances remain sparse. This study employs the instance space analysis (ISA) methodology to systematically analyze the instance space of this problem and assess &amp; predict the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, including exact, heuristic, and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods. A dataset was compiled using graph instances from TWITTER, COLLAB and IMDB-BINARY benchmarks commonly used in graph machine learning research. A set of 33 generic and 2 problem-specific polynomial-time-computable graph-based features, including several spectral properties, was employed for the ISA. A composite performance mea- sure incorporating both solution quality and algorithm runtime was utilized. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the exact algorithm Mixed Order Maximum Clique (MOMC) exhib- ited superior performance across approximately 74.7% of the instance space constituted by the compiled dataset. Gurobi &amp; CliSAT accounted for superior performance in 13.8% and 11% of the instance space, respectively. The ISA-based algorithm performance prediction model run on 34 challenging test instances compiled from the BHOSLIB and DIMACS datasets yielded top-1 and top-2 best performing algorithm prediction accuracies of 88% and 97%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Matrix Editing Meets Fair Clustering: Parameterized Algorithms and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational problem of computing a fair means clustering of discrete vectors, which admits an equivalent formulation as editing a colored matrix into one with few distinct color-balanced rows by changing at most $k$ values. While NP-hard in both the fairness-oblivious and the fair settings, the problem is well-known to admit a fixed-parameter algorithm in the former ``vanilla'' setting. As our first contribution, we exclude an analogous algorithm even for highly restricted fair means clustering instances. We then proceed to obtain a full complexity landscape of the problem, and establish tractability results which capture three means of circumventing our obtained lower bound: placing additional constraints on the problem instances, fixed-parameter approximation, or using an alternative parameterization targeting tree-like matrices.</description>

      <title>Robust Algorithms for Path and Cycle Problems in Geometric Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of robust subexponential algorithms for classical connectivity problems on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this setting, each vertex corresponds to a geometric object, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their objects intersect. We introduce a new tool for designing such algorithms, which we call a $\lambda$-linked partition. This is a partition of the vertex set into groups of highly connected vertices. Crucially, such a partition can be computed in polynomial time and does not require access to the geometric representation of the graph. We apply this framework to problems related to paths and cycles in graphs. First, we obtain the first robust ETH-tight algorithms for Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle, running in time $2^{O(n^{1-1/d})}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This resolves an open problem of de Berg et al. [STOC 2018] and completes the study of these problems on geometric intersection graphs from the viewpoint of ETH-tight exact algorithms. We further extend our approach to the parameterized setting and design the first robust subexponential parameterized algorithm for Long Path in any fixed dimension $d$. More precisely, we obtain a randomized robust algorithm running in time $2^{O(k^{1-1/d}\log^2 k)}\, n^{O(1)}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $k$ is the natural parameter. Besides $\lambda$-linked partitions, our algorithm also relies on a low-treewidth pattern covering theorem that we establish for geometric intersection graphs, which may be viewed as a refinement of a result of Marx-Pilipczuk [ESA 2017]. This structural result may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Aggregating maximal cliques in real-world graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal clique enumeration is a fundamental graph mining task, but its utility is often limited by computational intractability and highly redundant output. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{$\rho$-dense aggregators}, a novel approach that succinctly captures maximal clique structure. Instead of listing all cliques, we identify a small collection of clusters with edge density at least $\rho$ that collectively contain every maximal clique.
  In contrast to maximal clique enumeration, we prove that for all $\rho &lt; 1$, every graph admits a $\rho$-dense aggregator of \emph{sub-exponential} size, $n^{O(\log_{1/\rho}n)}$, and provide an algorithm achieving this bound. For graphs with bounded degeneracy, a typical characteristic of real-world networks, our algorithm runs in near-linear time and produces near-linear size aggregators. We also establish a matching lower bound on aggregator size, proving our results are essentially tight. In an empirical evaluation on real-world networks, we demonstrate significant practical benefits for the use of aggregators: our algorithm is consistently faster than the state-of-the-art clique enumeration algorithm, with median speedups over $6\times$ for $\rho=0.1$ (and over $300\times$ in an extreme case), while delivering a much more concise structural summary.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Searching for the Longest Segment and the Largest Empty Rectangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider the problem of searching for the Largest empty rectangle in a 2D map, and the one-dimensional version of the problem is the problem of searching for the largest empty segment. We present a quantum algorithm for the Largest Empty Square problem and the Largest Empty Rectangle of a fixed width $d$ for $n\times n$-rectangular map. Query complexity of the algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ for the square case, and $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d})$ for the rectangle with a fixed width $d$ case, respectively. At the same time, the lower bounds for the classical case are $\Omega(n^2)$, and $\Omega(nd)$, respectively. The Quantum algorithm for the one-dimensional version of the problem has $O(\sqrt{n}\log n\log\log n)$ query complexity. The quantum lower bound for the problem is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ which is almost equal to the upper bound up to a log factor. The classical lower bound is $\Omega(n)$. So, we obtain the quadratic speed-up for the problem.</description>

      <title>An FPRAS for Model Counting for Non-Deterministic Read-Once Branching Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-deterministic read-once branching programs, also known as non-deterministic free binary decision diagrams (nFBDD), are a fundamental data structure in computer science for representing Boolean functions. In this paper, we focus on #nFBDD, the problem of model counting for non-deterministic read-once branching programs. The #nFBDD problem is #P-hard, and it is known that there exists a quasi-polynomial randomized approximation scheme for #nFBDD. In this paper, we provide the first FPRAS for #nFBDD. Our result relies on the introduction of new analysis techniques that focus on bounding the dependence of samples.</description>

      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Subset Sum: An Adaptive, Structure-Aware Solver with Sub-$2^{n/2}$ Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Subset Sum problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ integers has a subset summing to a target $t$, is a fundamental NP-complete problem in cryptography and combinatorial optimization. The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2})$, which remains the best-known deterministic bound. Yet in practice, many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so the true difficulty is often governed by $U = |\Sigma(S)|$, the number of unique subset sums.
  We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only the distinct subset sums, pruning duplicates on the fly and achieving deterministic runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n^2)$ and expected randomized runtime $\mathcal{O}(U \cdot n)$. Its core is a canonical unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy, supporting anytime and online modes.
  To ensure worst-case gains even on unstructured inputs, we introduce a Controlled Aliasing technique that provably reduces the enumeration space by a fixed constant factor. This yields a guaranteed global runtime of $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, strictly improving upon classical bounds.
  Empirical results show that the solver adapts efficiently to structured inputs with low entropy (e.g., instances with small doubling constants, duplicates, or additive progressions) often approaching near-dynamic programming performance. We conclude by outlining how this adaptive framework can be extended to other NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Analysis of Online Metric Matching with a Single Sample: Beyond Metric Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the online metric matching problem, $n$ servers and $n$ requests lie in a metric space. Servers are available upfront, and requests arrive sequentially. An arriving request must be matched immediately and irrevocably to an available server, incurring a cost equal to their distance. The goal is to minimize the total matching cost.
  We study this problem in the Euclidean metric $[0, 1]^d$, when servers are adversarial and requests are independently drawn from distinct distributions that satisfy a mild smoothness condition. Our main result is an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for $d \neq 2$ that requires no distributional knowledge, relying only on a single sample from each request distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to achieve an $o(\log n)$ competitive ratio for non-trivial metrics beyond the i.i.d. setting. Our approach bypasses the $\Omega(\log n)$ barrier introduced by probabilistic metric embeddings: instead of analyzing the embedding distortion and the algorithm separately, we directly bound the cost of the algorithm on the target metric of a simple deterministic embedding. We then combine this analysis with lower bounds on the offline optimum for Euclidean metrics, derived via majorization arguments, to obtain our guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narayanan showed the existence of the principal partition sequence of a submodular function, a structure with numerous applications in areas such as clustering, fast algorithms, and approximation algorithms. In this work, motivated by two applications, we develop a theory of $\{s,t\}$-separating principal partition sequence of a submodular function. We define this sequence, show its existence, and design a polynomial-time algorithm to construct it. We show two applications: (1) approximation algorithm for the $\{s,t\}$-separating submodular $k$-partitioning problem for monotone and posimodular functions and (2) polynomial-time algorithm for the hypergraph orientation problem of finding an orientation that simultaneously has strong connectivity at least $k$ and $(s,t)$-connectivity at least $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Optimal-Length Labeling Schemes and Fast Algorithms for k-gathering and k-broadcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider basic communication tasks in arbitrary radio networks: $k$-broadcasting and $k$-gathering. In the case of $k$-broadcasting messages from $k$ sources have to get to all nodes in the network. The goal of $k$-gathering is to collect messages from $k$ source nodes in a designated sink node. We consider these problems in the framework of distributed algorithms with advice. Krisko and Miller showed in 2021 that the optimal size of advice for $k$-broadcasting is $\Theta(\min(\log \Delta,$ $ \log k))$, where $\Delta$ is equal to the maximum degree of a vertex of the input communication graph. We show that the same bound $\Theta(\min(\log \Delta, \log k))$ on the size of optimal labeling scheme holds also for the $k$-gathering problems. Moreover, we design fast algorithms for both problems with asymptotically optimal size of advice. For $k$-gathering our algorithm works in at most $D+k$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the communication graph. This time bound is optimal even for centralized algorithms. We apply the $k$-gathering algorithm for $k$-broadcasting to achieve an algorithm working in time $O(D+\log^2 n+k)$ rounds. We also exhibit a logarithmic time complexity gap between distributed algorithms with advice of optimal size and distributed algorithms with distinct arbitrary labels.</description>

Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have long been observed to obtain near-optimal performance in various Bayesian inference settings. However, developing a supporting theory that makes these studies rigorous has proved challenging.
  In this paper, we study the classical spiked Wigner inference problem, where one aims to recover a planted Boolean spike from a noisy matrix measurement. We relate the recovery performance of Glauber dynamics on the annealed posterior to the performance of Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is known to achieve Bayes-optimal performance. Our main results rely on the analysis of an auxiliary Markov chain called restricted Gaussian dynamics (RGD). Concretely, we establish the following results:
  1. RGD can be reduced to an effective one-dimensional recursion which mirrors the evolution of the AMP iterates.
  2. From a warm start, RGD rapidly converges to a fixed point in correlation space, which recovers Bayes-optimal performance when run on the posterior.
  3. Conditioned on widely believed mixing results for the SK model, we recover the phase transition for non-trivial inference.</description>
