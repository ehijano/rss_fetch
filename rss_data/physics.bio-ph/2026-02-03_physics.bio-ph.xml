      <title>Effects of PLGA coating on biological and mechanical behaviors of tissue engineering scaffolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaffolds have a key role in the clinical success of tissue engineering for the regeneration of damaged tissues. Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Control of Transportation Flow in Physarum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Physarum network expands or retracts in response to environmental stimuli, demonstrating an intelligent adaptive capability to locate optimal paths for nutrient transport. The underlying physical mechanism governing this intelligence behavior remains an unresolved problem in biological physics.unlike the unidirectional flow typical of urban traffic networks, cytoplasmic flow within the Physarum network exhibits periodic oscillations modulated by biological repellents and attractants. In this study, we investigate how local flows within the networks branch channels interact to collectively govern the global oscillatory dynamics.We find that the measured flow fluxes at intersection nodes obey Kirchhoff's current law. Phase differences exist among the flows in different branches.At the microscopic scale, flow distribution exhibits only brief periods of traffic congestion, which are resolved by the oscillatory flows. By mapping the flow flux vectors onto the magnetic moment vector of spin ice model, we demonstrate that the flow vectors strictly obey the ice-rule of vertex models in statistical physics.Notably, the three branches converging at a Y-shaped node never become blocked simultaneously, thereby preventing traffic congestion and ensuring efficient transmission of nutrients and signals.This intelligent flow control phenomenon offers novel insights for addressing traffic congestion and advances our understanding of frustrated quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>You ain't seen nothing, and yet: Future biochemical concentrations can be predicted with surprisingly high accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate sensing of chemical concentrations is essential for numerous biological processes. The accuracy of this sensing, for small numbers of molecules, is limited by shot noise. Corresponding theoretical limits on sensing precision, as a function of sensing duration, have been well-studied in the context of quasi-static and randomly fluctuating concentrations. However, during development and in many other cases, concentration profiles are not random but exhibit predictable spatiotemporal patterns. We propose that leveraging prior knowledge of these structured profiles can improve and accelerate concentration sensing by utilizing information from current molecular binding events to predict future concentrations. By framing the constrained sensing problem as Bayesian inference over an allowed class of spatiotemporal profiles, we derive new theoretical limits on sensing accuracy. Our analysis reveals that maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation can outperform the classical Berg-Purcell and maximum-likelihood (Poisson counting) limits, achieving a sensing precision of $\delta c/c = 1/\sqrt{a^2N}$, where $N$ is the number of binding events, and $a &gt; 1$ in certain cases. Thus knowledge of the statistical structure of concentration profiles enhances sensing precision, providing a potential explanation for the rapid yet highly accurate cell fate decisions observed during development.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Peripheral Surface Information Entropy from Globular Protein-Peptide Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting favorable protein-peptide binding events remains a central challenge in biophysics, with continued uncertainty surrounding how nonlocal effects shape the global energy landscape. Here, we introduce peripheral surface information (PSI) entropy, a quantitative measure of the statistical variability in apolar and charged non-interacting surface (NIS) proportions across conformational ensembles. Using energy-directed molecular docking via HADDOCK3 and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that favorable binding partners exhibit emergent, low-entropy N-states (discrete macrostates in NIS state space) indicative of preferential apolar/charged surface configurations. Across dozens of peptides and multiple receptor systems (WW, PDZ, and MDM2 domains), dominant N-states persisted under varied docking parameters and initial conditions. An experimental meta-ensemble of WW domains from 36 high-resolution structures confirmed the presence of dominant NIS modes independent of in silico methodology, suggesting an evolutionary selection pressure toward specific NIS fingerprints. These findings establish PSI entropy as a thermoinformatic descriptor that encodes favorable binding constraints into unique statistical signatures of the NIS.</description>

      <title>Size and shape of terrestrial animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural selection for terrestrial locomotion has yielded unifying patterns in the body shape of legged animals, often manifesting as scaling laws. One such pattern appears in the frontal aspect ratio. Smaller animals like insects typically adopt a landscape frontal aspect ratio, with a wider side-to-side base of support than center of mass height. Larger animals like elephants, however, are taller than wide with a portrait aspect ratio. Known explanations for postural scaling are restricted to animal groups with similar anatomical and behavioural motifs, but the trend in frontal aspect ratio transcends such commonalities. Here we show that vertebrates and invertebrates with diverse body plans, ranging in mass from 28 mg to 22000 kg, exhibit size-dependent scaling of the frontal aspect ratio driven by the need for lateral stability on uneven natural terrain. Because natural terrain exhibit scale-dependent unevenness, and the frontal aspect ratio is important for lateral stability during locomotion, smaller animals need a wider aspect ratio for stability. This prediction is based on the fractal property of natural terrain unevenness, requires no anatomical or behavioural parameters, and agrees with the measured scaling despite vast anatomical and behavioural differences. Furthermore, a statistical phylogenetic comparative analysis found that shared ancestry and random trait evolution cannot explain the measured scaling. Thus, our findings reveal that terrain roughness, acting through natural selection for stability, likely drove the macroevolution of frontal shape in terrestrial animals.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic cost-controllability tradeoff in metabolic currency coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular metabolism is globally regulated by various currency metabolites such as ATP, GTP, and NAD(P)H. These metabolites cycle between charged (high-energy) and uncharged (low-energy) states to mediate energy transfer. While distinct currency metabolites are associated with different metabolic functions, their charged and uncharged forms are generally interchangeable via biochemical reactions such as ${\rm ATP{\,+\,}GDP{\,\rightleftharpoons\,}ADP{\,+\,}GTP}$ and $\rm NADP^+{\,+\,}NADH{\,\rightleftharpoons\,}NADPH{\,+\,}NAD^+ $. Thus, their energetic states are generally coupled and influence each other, which would hinder the independent regulation of different currency metabolites. Despite the extensive knowledge of the molecular biology of individual currency metabolites, it remains poorly understood how the coordination of various coupled currency metabolites shapes metabolic regulation, efficiency, and ultimately the evolution of organisms. Here, we present a minimal theoretical model of metabolic currency coupling and reveal a fundamental tradeoff relationship between metabolic controllability and thermodynamic cost: increasing the capacity to independently regulate multiple currency metabolites generally requires comparable abundances of those metabolites, which in turn incurs a higher entropy production rate. The tradeoff suggests that in complex environments, organisms evolutionarily favor an equal abundance of currency metabolites to enhance metabolic controllability at the expense of a higher thermodynamic cost; conversely, in simple environments, organisms evolve to have imbalanced amounts of them to reduce heat dissipation. These considerations also offer a hypothesis regarding evolutionary trends in nucleotide-pool balance and genomic GC content.</description>

      <title>Plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery mechanisms in spider silk fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spider silk is a remarkable biomaterial with exceptional stiffness, strength, and toughness stemming from a unique microstructure. While recent studies show that silk fibers exhibit plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery under cyclic loading, the underlying microstructural mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this work, we propose a mechanism explaining the loading-unloading-relaxation response through microstructural evolution: initial loading distorts intermolecular bonds, resulting in a linear elastic regime. Upon reaching the yield stress, these bonds dissociate and the external load is transferred to the polypeptide chains, which deform entropically to allow large deformations. Unloading is driven by entropic shortening until a traction free state with residual stretch is achieved. Subsequently, the fiber recovers as chains reorganize and bonds reform, locking the microstructure into a new stable equilibrium that increases stiffness in subsequent cycles. Following these mechanisms, we develop a microscopically motivated, energy-based model that captures the macroscopic response of silk fibers under cyclic loading. The response is decoupled into two parallel networks: (1) an elasto-plastic network of inter- and intramolecular bonds governing the initial stiffness and yield stress, and (2) an elastic network of entropic chains that enable large deformations. The model is validated against experimental data from Argiope bruennichi dragline silk. The findings from this work are three-fold: (1) explaining the mechanisms that govern hysteresis and recovery and linking them to microstructural evolution; (2) quantifying the recovery process of the fiber, which restores and enhances mechanical properties; and (3) establishing a predictive foundation for engineering synthetic fibers with customized properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the electrical signals generated by living cells is key to understanding numerous biological phenomena. Electrochromic optical recording (ECORE) uses the electrochromism exhibited by certain materials to noninvasively measure these signals in real time. In this work, we report on the development of ECORE based on a high-NA microscope objective. We demonstrate the recording of extracellular action potentials from cardiomyocytes with single-cell resolution and a high sensitivity of 3 {\mu}V, which compares favorably to the previous record for any ECORE setup. Combining ECORE with microscopy simplifies the optical setup, allows for the simultaneous imaging of specimens, and makes ECORE accessible to a broader community of researchers, allowing for a better understanding of the biological processes that are integral to life.</description>

      <title>A Three-State Thermodynamically Consistent Cross-Bridge Model for Muscle Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muscle contraction is a prototypical multiscale chemomechanical process in which ATP hydrolysis at the molecular level drives force generation and mechanical work at larger scales. A long-standing challenge is to connect microscopic cross-bridge dynamics to macroscopic observables while retaining an explicit, thermodynamically consistent energetic budget for chemical-to-mechanical transduction. Here we use the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA) to unify Hill's cycle-affinity viewpoint with Huxley's sliding-filament mechanics within a single thermodynamically closed framework. We formulate a three-state Fokker--Planck-jump description for cross-bridge populations evolving on state-dependent free-energy landscapes, in which ATP hydrolysis enters through local detailed balance and biases the transition rates. Filament sliding velocity is incorporated as a convective transport mechanism in the Fokker--Planck dynamics, so that mechanical power exchange with the external motion emerges transparently from the resulting energy-dissipation law together with chemical input and irreversible dissipation. Under chemostatted conditions and a fast-equilibration closure for the attached substates, the model reduces to a closed two-state molecular motor description; in a further singular limit, this reduction recovers a Huxley-type transport-reaction equation. Proof-of-concept simulations of the reduced model reproduce a Hill-like force-velocity relation and show how ATP availability modulates the force-velocity curve while preserving its characteristic Hill-type shape.</description>

      <title>Short-wave admittance correction for a time-domain cochlear transmission line model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission line (TL) models implemented in the time domain can efficiently simulate basilar-membrane (BM) displacement in response to transient or non-stationary sounds. By design, a TL model is well-suited for an one-dimensional (1-D) characterization of the traveling wave, but the real configuration of the cochlea also introduces higher-dimensional effects. Such effects include the focusing of the pressure around the BM and transverse viscous damping, both of which are magnified in the short-wave region. The two effects depend on the wavelength and are more readily expressed in the frequency domain. In this paper, we introduce a numerical correction for the BM admittance to account for 2-D effects in the time domain using autoregressive filtering and regression techniques. The correction was required for the implementation of a TL model tailored to the gerbil cochlear physiology. The model, which includes instantaneous nonlinearities in the form of variable damping, initially presented insufficient compression with increasing sound levels. This limitation was explained by the strong coupling between gain and frequency selectivity assumed in the 1-D nonlinear TL model, whereas cochlear frequency selectivity shows only a moderate dependence on sound level in small mammals. The correction factor was implemented in the gerbil model and made level-dependent using a feedback loop. The updated model achieved some decoupling between frequency selectivity and gain, providing 5 dB of additional gain and extending the range of sound levels of the compressive regime by 10 dB. We discuss the relevance of this work through two key features: the integration of both analytical and regression methods for characterizing BM admittance, and the combination of instantaneous and non-instantaneous nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spatio-Temporal SE(3) Diffusion for Long-Horizon Protein Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the gold standard for studying protein dynamics, but their computational cost limits access to biologically relevant timescales. Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03010v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micron-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to cellular-level tissue structure. Precision medicine and quantitative imaging depend on uncovering the information content of dMRI and establishing its parsimonious hardware-independent fingerprint. Based on the rotational SO(3) symmetry, we study the geometry of the dMRI signal and the topology of its acquisition, identify irreducible components and a full set of invariants for the cumulant tensors, and relate them to tissue properties. Including all kurtosis invariants improves multiple sclerosis classification in a cohort of 1189 subjects. We design the shortest acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices to determine the most used invariants in only 1-2 minutes for whole brain. Representing dMRI via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMRI into clinic.</description>

      <title>Active Screws: Emergent Active Chiral Nematics of Spinning Self-Propelled Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, they form an active nematic at high density and activity. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.</description>

Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is a ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</description>

      <title>MERGE-RNA: a physics-based model to predict RNA secondary structure ensembles with chemical probing</title>

Abstract: RNA function is deeply tied to secondary structure, with most molecules operating through dynamic and heterogeneous structural ensembles. While current analysis tools typically output single static structures or averaged contact maps, chemical probing methods like DMS capture nucleotide-resolution signals that represent the full structural ensemble, which however remain of difficult structural interpretation. To address this, we present MERGE-RNA, a framework that explicitly describes and outputs RNA as a structural ensemble. By modeling the experimental pipeline through a statistical physics framework, MERGE-RNA learns a small set of transferable and interpretable parameters, enabling the seamless integration of measurements across different molecules, probe concentrations, and replicates in a single optimization to improve robustness. Our model employs a maximum-entropy principle to predict thermodynamic populations, introducing only the minimal sequence-specific adjustments necessary to align the ensemble with experimental data. We validate MERGE-RNA on diverse RNAs, showing that it achieves strong structural accuracy and the ability to fill knowledge gaps in single-conformation reference structures. Furthermore, in a designed RNA construct for which we report new DMS data, MERGE-RNA deconvolves mixed states to reveal transient intermediate populations involved in strand displacement, dynamics that remain invisible to traditional analysis methods.</description>
