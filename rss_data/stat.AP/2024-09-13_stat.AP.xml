      <title>Unsupervised anomaly detection in spatio-temporal stream network sensor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of in-situ digital sensors for water quality monitoring is becoming increasingly common worldwide. While these sensors provide near real-time data for science, the data are prone to technical anomalies that can undermine the trustworthiness of the data and the accuracy of statistical inferences, particularly in spatial and temporal analyses. Here we propose a framework for detecting anomalies in sensor data recorded in stream networks, which takes advantage of spatial and temporal autocorrelation to improve detection rates. The proposed framework involves the implementation of effective data imputation to handle missing data, alignment of time-series to address temporal disparities, and the identification of water quality events. We explore the effectiveness of a suite of state-of-the-art statistical methods including posterior predictive distributions, finite mixtures, and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). We showcase the practical implementation of automated anomaly detection in near-real time by employing a Bayesian recursive approach. This demonstration is conducted through a comprehensive simulation study and a practical application to a substantive case study situated in the Herbert River, located in Queensland, Australia, which flows into the Great Barrier Reef. We found that methods such as posterior predictive distributions and HMM produce the best performance in detecting multiple types of anomalies. Utilizing data from multiple sensors deployed relatively near one another enhances the ability to distinguish between water quality events and technical anomalies, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of anomaly detection. Thus, uncertainty and biases in water quality reporting, interpretation, and modelling are reduced, and the effectiveness of subsequent management actions improved.</description>

      <title>Causal inference and racial bias in policing: New estimands and the importance of mobility data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying racial bias in policing is a critically important problem, but one that comes with a number of inherent difficulties due to the nature of the available data. In this manuscript we tackle multiple key issues in the causal analysis of racial bias in policing. First, we formalize race and place policing, the idea that individuals of one race are policed differently when they are in neighborhoods primarily made up of individuals of other races. We develop an estimand to study this question rigorously, show the assumptions necessary for causal identification, and develop sensitivity analyses to assess robustness to violations of key assumptions. Additionally, we investigate difficulties with existing estimands targeting racial bias in policing. We show for these estimands, and the estimands developed in this manuscript, that estimation can benefit from incorporating mobility data into analyses. We apply these ideas to a study in New York City, where we find a large amount of racial bias, as well as race and place policing, and that these findings are robust to large violations of untestable assumptions. We additionally show that mobility data can make substantial impacts on the resulting estimates, suggesting it should be used whenever possible in subsequent studies.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian framework to evaluate evidence in cases of alleged cheating with secret codes in sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian framework to analyze a case of alleged cheating in the mind sport contract bridge. We explain why a Bayesian approach is called for, and not a frequentistic one. We argue that such a Bayesian framework can and should also be used in other sports for cases of alleged cheating by means of illegal signalling.</description>

      <title>Spatial Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial prediction problems often use Gaussian process models, which can be computationally burdensome in high dimensions. Specification of an appropriate covariance function for the model can be challenging when complex non-stationarities exist. Recent work has shown that pre-computed spatial basis functions and a feed-forward neural network can capture complex spatial dependence structures while remaining computationally efficient. This paper builds on this literature by tailoring spatial basis functions for use in convolutional neural networks. Through both simulated and real data, we demonstrate that this approach yields more accurate spatial predictions than existing methods. Uncertainty quantification is also considered.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Aware Approach to Adversarial Robustness in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the growing prominence of production-level AI and the threat of adversarial attacks that can evade a model at run-time, evaluating the robustness of models to these evasion attacks is of critical importance. Additionally, testing model changes likely means deploying the models to (e.g. a car or a medical imaging device), or a drone to see how it affects performance, making un-tested changes a public problem that reduces development speed, increases cost of development, and makes it difficult (if not impossible) to parse cause from effect. In this work, we used survival analysis as a cloud-native, time-efficient and precise method for predicting model performance in the presence of adversarial noise. For neural networks in particular, the relationships between the learning rate, batch size, training time, convergence time, and deployment cost are highly complex, so researchers generally rely on benchmark datasets to assess the ability of a model to generalize beyond the training data. To address this, we propose using accelerated failure time models to measure the effect of hardware choice, batch size, number of epochs, and test-set accuracy by using adversarial attacks to induce failures on a reference model architecture before deploying the model to the real world. We evaluate several GPU types and use the Tree Parzen Estimator to maximize model robustness and minimize model run-time simultaneously. This provides a way to evaluate the model and optimise it in a single step, while simultaneously allowing us to model the effect of model parameters on training time, prediction time, and accuracy. Using this technique, we demonstrate that newer, more-powerful hardware does decrease the training time, but with a monetary and power cost that far outpaces the marginal gains in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Weather-Informed Probabilistic Forecasting and Scenario Generation in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into power grids presents significant challenges due to their intrinsic stochasticity and uncertainty, necessitating the development of new techniques for reliable and efficient forecasting. This paper proposes a method combining probabilistic forecasting and Gaussian copula for day-ahead prediction and scenario generation of load, wind, and solar power in high-dimensional contexts. By incorporating weather covariates and restoring spatio-temporal correlations, the proposed method enhances the reliability of probabilistic forecasts in RES. Extensive numerical experiments compare the effectiveness of different time series models, with performance evaluated using comprehensive metrics on a real-world and high-dimensional dataset from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The results highlight the importance of weather information and demonstrate the efficacy of the Gaussian copula in generating realistic scenarios, with the proposed weather-informed Temporal Fusion Transformer (WI-TFT) model showing superior performance.</description>

      <title>Identification of head impact locations, speeds, and force based on head kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Head impact information including impact directions, speeds and force are important to study traumatic brain injury, design and evaluate protective gears. This study presents a deep learning model developed to accurately predict head impact information, including location, speed, orientation, and force, based on head kinematics during helmeted impacts. Methods: Leveraging a dataset of 16,000 simulated helmeted head impacts using the Riddell helmet finite element model, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to process the head kinematics: tri-axial linear accelerations and angular velocities. Results: The models accurately predict the impact parameters describing impact location, direction, speed, and the impact force profile with R2 exceeding 70% for all tasks. Further validation was conducted using an on-field dataset recorded by instrumented mouthguards and videos, consisting of 79 head impacts in which the impact location can be clearly identified. The deep learning model significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving a 79.7% accuracy in identifying impact locations, compared to lower accuracies with traditional methods (the highest accuracy of existing methods is 49.4%). Conclusion: The precision underscores the model's potential in enhancing helmet design and safety in sports by providing more accurate impact data. Future studies should test the models across various helmets and sports on large in vivo datasets to validate the accuracy of the models, employing techniques like transfer learning to broaden its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Time Series of Magnetic Field Parameters of Merged MDI and HMI Space-Weather Active Region Patches as Potential Tool for Solar Flare Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar flare prediction studies have been recently conducted with the use of Space-Weather MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) Active Region Patches (SMARP) and Space-Weather HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory) Active Region Patches (SHARP), which are two currently available data products containing magnetic field characteristics of solar active regions. The present work is an effort to combine them into one data product, and perform some initial statistical analyses in order to further expand their application in space weather forecasting. The combined data are derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP with SHARP parameters, which can then be spatially reduced to create uniform multivariate time series. The resulting combined MDI-HMI dataset currently spans the period between April 4, 1996, and December 13, 2022, and may be extended to a more recent date. This provides an opportunity to correlate and compare it with other space weather time series, such as the daily solar flare index or the statistical properties of the soft X-ray flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Time-lagged cross-correlation indicates that a relationship may exist, where some magnetic field properties of active regions lead the flare index in time. Applying the rolling window technique makes it possible to see how this leader-follower dynamic varies with time. Preliminary results indicate that areas of high correlation generally correspond to increased flare activity during the peak solar cycle.</description>

      <title>Inferring flavor mixtures in multijet events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multijet events with heavy-flavors are of central importance at the LHC since many relevant processes -- such as $t\bar t$, $hh$, $t\bar t h$ and others -- have a preferred branching ratio for this final state. Current techniques for tackling these processes use hard-assignment selections through $b$-tagging working points, and suffer from systematic uncertainties because of the difficulties in Monte Carlo simulations. We develop a flexible Bayesian mixture model approach to simultaneously infer $b$-tagging score distributions and the flavor mixture composition in the dataset. We model multidimensional jet events, and to enhance estimation efficiency, we design structured priors that leverages the continuity and unimodality of the $b$-tagging score distributions. Remarkably, our method eliminates the need for a parametric assumption and is robust against model misspecification -- It works for arbitrarily flexible continuous curves and is better if they are unimodal. We have run a toy inferential process with signal $bbbb$ and backgrounds $bbcc$ and $cccc$, and we find that with a few hundred events we can recover the true mixture fractions of the signal and backgrounds, as well as the true $b$-tagging score distribution curves, despite their arbitrariness and nonparametric shapes. We discuss prospects for taking these findings into a realistic scenario in a physics analysis. The presented results could be a starting point for a different and novel kind of analysis in multijet events, with a scope competitive with current state-of-the-art analyses. We also discuss the possibility of using these results in general cases of signals and backgrounds with approximately known continuous distributions and/or expected unimodality.</description>
