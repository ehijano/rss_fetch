      <title>Can dark energy explain a high growth index?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising way to test the physics of the accelerated expansion of the Universe is by studying the growth rate of matter fluctuations, which can be parameterized by the matter energy density parameter to the power $\gamma$, the so-called growth index. It is well-known that the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology predicts $\gamma=0.55$. However, using observational data, Ref. \citep{Nguyen:2023fip} measured a much higher $\gamma=0.633^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, excluding the $\Lambda$CDM value within $3.7\sigma$. In this work, we analyze whether Dark Energy (DE) with the Equation of State (EoS) parameter described by the CPL parametrization can significantly modify $\gamma$ with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM one. Besides the usual Smooth DE (SDE) scenario, where DE perturbations are neglected on small scales, we also consider the case of Clustering Dark Energy (CDE), which has more potential to impact the growth of matter perturbations. In order to minimally constrain the background evolution and assess the largest meaningful $\gamma$ distribution, we use data from $32$ Cosmic Chronometers, $H(z$), data points. In this context, we found that both SDE and CDE models described by the CPL parametrization can not provide a significant number of $\gamma$ samples compatible with the value determined in Nguyen et al. (2023). Therefore, explaining the measured value of $\gamma$ is a challenge for DE models. Moreover, we present new fitting functions for $\gamma$, which are more accurate and general than the one proposed in Linder (2005) for SDE, and, for the first time, fitting functions for CDE models.</description>

      <title>A perceptron based ILC method to obtain accurate CMB B-mode angular power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation have made significant contributions to our understanding of cosmology. While temperature observations of the CMB have greatly advanced our knowledge, the next frontier lies in detecting the elusive B-modes and obtaining precise reconstructions of the CMB's polarized signal in general. In anticipation of proposed and upcoming CMB polarization missions, this study introduces a novel method for accurately determining the angular power spectrum of CMB B-modes. We have developed a Neural Network-based approach to enhance the performance of the Internal Linear Combination (ILC) technique. Our method is applied to the frequency channels of the proposed ECHO (Exploring Cosmic History and Origins) mission and its performance is rigorously assessed. Our findings demonstrate the method's efficiency in achieving precise reconstructions of CMB B-mode angular power spectra, with errors constrained primarily by cosmic variance.</description>

      <title>Cosmological consequences of statistical inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A space-dependent mean for cosmological perturbations negates the ansatz of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, and hence ergodicity. In this work, we construct such a primordial mean of scalar perturbations from an alternative quantum initial state (coherent state) and examine the associated power and bi-spectra. A multitude of cosmological tests based on these spectra are discussed. We find that current cosmological data doesn't favor a primordial mean over large scales and strong constraints arise from the limit on bispectrum from Planck data. At small scales, this hypothesis can be tested by future observables such as $\mu$-distortion of CMB.</description>

      <title>A New Limit on the Graviton Mass from the Convergence Scale of the CMB Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clustering dipole in the 2MASS galaxy survey converges on a scale of ~400Mpc to the local peculiar velocity inferred from the Cosmic-Microwave-Background dipole. I show that this limits the graviton mass in Yukawa theories of gravity to less than 5x10^{-32}eV. The new limit is 2.5x10^8 times tighter than the latest constraint from gravitational waves detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Reheating constraints and the $H_0$ tension in Quintessential Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on two important aspects of modern cosmology: reheating and Hubble constant tension within the framework of a unified model, namely, quintessential inflation connecting the early inflationary era and late-time cosmic acceleration. In the context of reheating, we use instant preheating and gravitational reheating, two viable reheating mechanisms when the evolution of the universe is not affected by an oscillating regime. After obtaining the reheating temperature, we analyze the number of $e$-folds and establish its relationship with the reheating temperature. This allows us to connect, for different quintessential inflation models, the reheating temperature with the spectral index of scalar perturbations, thereby enabling us to constrain its values. In the second part of this article, we explore various alternatives to address the $H_0$ tension, a discrepancy which indicates a possible revision of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Initially, we establish that quintessential inflation alone cannot mitigate the Hubble tension by solely deviating from the concordance model at low redshifts. The introduction of a phantom fluid, capable of increasing the Hubble rate at the present time, becomes a crucial element in alleviating the Hubble tension, resulting in a deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model only at low redshifts. On a different note, by utilizing quintessential inflation as a source of early dark energy, thereby diminishing the physical size of the sound horizon close to the baryon-photon decoupling redshift, we observe a reduction in the Hubble tension. This alternative avenue, which has the same effect of a cosmological constant changing its scale close to the recombination, sheds light on the nuanced interplay between the quintessential inflation and the Hubble tension, offering a distinct perspective on addressing this cosmological challenge.</description>

      <title>Reheating Dynamics in Inflationary Cosmology: Insights from $\alpha$-Attractor and $\alpha$-Starobinsky Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reheating in inflationary cosmology is essential for understanding the early universe, influencing particle production, thermalization, and the primordial power spectrum. Crucial quantities defined during the reheating epoc, such as the equation of state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reheating temperature $T_{re}$, and the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, affect inflationary observables like the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We analyze two classes of inflationary models: generalized $\alpha$-attractor models and the $\alpha$-Starobinsky generalization. These models, motivated by supergravity and string theory, exhibit attractor behavior, ensuring strong predictions and have been studied extensively before. A salient novelty of this study, compared to previous works, is the inclusion of an analytical expression for the reheating temperature, $T_{\text{re}}$, which makes it a dynamical quantity. This is crucial for determining all the cosmological quantities analyzed in this work. Our results show a universal scaling behavior for a tightly bounded $T_{re}$ in both models. We believe this is the first time that $T_{re}$ is so closely determined. This work complements previous Bayesian and numerical studies by providing detailed numerical and analytical insights into the evolution of cosmological observables and reheating parameters, offering also constraints on inflationary models based on observational data.</description>

      <title>Requirements on the gain calibration for LiteBIRD polarisation data with blind component separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments are primarily targeting a detection of the primordial $B$-mode polarisation. The faintness of this signal requires exquisite control of systematic effects which may bias the measurements. In this work, we derive requirements on the relative calibration accuracy of the overall polarisation gain ($\Delta g_\nu$) for LiteBIRD experiment, through the application of the blind Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) foreground-cleaning method. We find that minimum variance techniques, as NILC, are less affected by gain calibration uncertainties than a parametric approach, which requires a proper modelling of these instrumental effects. The tightest constraints are obtained for frequency channels where the CMB signal is relatively brighter (166 GHz channel, $\Delta {g}_\nu \approx 0.16 \%$), while, with a parametric approach, the strictest requirements were on foreground-dominated channels. We then propagate gain calibration uncertainties, corresponding to the derived requirements, into all frequency channels simultaneously. We find that the overall impact on the estimated $r$ is lower than the required budget for LiteBIRD by almost a factor $5$. The adopted procedure to derive requirements assumes a simple Galactic model. We therefore assess the robustness of obtained results against more realistic scenarios by injecting the gain calibration uncertainties, according to the requirements, into LiteBIRD simulated maps and assuming intermediate- and high-complexity sky models. In this case, we employ the so-called Multi-Clustering NILC (MC-NILC) foreground-cleaning pipeline and obtain that the impact of gain calibration uncertainties on $r$ is lower than the LiteBIRD gain systematics budget for the intermediate-complexity sky model. For the high-complexity case, instead, it would be necessary to tighten the requirements by a factor $1.8$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble constant with scattering in host galaxies of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the Hubble constant (H$_0$) is one of the most important missions in astronomy. Nevertheless, recent studies exhibit differences between the employed methods. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are coherent radio transients with large dispersion measures (DM) with a duration of milliseconds. DM$_{\rm IGM}$, DM in the intergalactic medium (IGM), could open a new avenue for probing H$_0$. However, it has been challenging to separate DM contributions from different components (i.e., the IGM and the host galaxy plasma), and this hampers the accurate measurements of DM$_{\rm IGM}$ and hence H$_0$. We adopted a method to overcome this problem by using the temporal scattering of the FRB pulses due to the propagation effect through the host galaxy plasma (scattering time). The scattering-inferred DM in a host galaxy improves the estimate of DM$_{\rm IGM}$, which in turn leads to a better constraint on H$_0$. In previous studies, a certain value or distribution has conventionally been assumed of the dispersion measure in host galaxies (DM$_{\rm h}$). We compared this method with ours by generating 100 mock FRBs, and we found that our method reduces the systematic (statistical) error of H$_0$ by 9.1% (1%) compared to the previous method. We applied our method to 30 localized FRB sources with both scattering and spectroscopic redshift measurements to constrain H$_0$. Our result is H$_0$=74$_{-7.2}^{+7.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, where the central value prefers the value obtained from local measurements over the cosmic microwave background. We also measured DM$_{\rm h}$ with a median value of $103^{+68}_{-48}$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The reduction in systematic error is comparable to the Hubble tension ($\sim10$%). Combined with the fact that more localized FRBs will become available, our result indicates that our method can be used to address the Hubble tension using future FRB samples.</description>

      <title>Refining the nonlinear modelling of primordial oscillatory features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial oscillatory features in the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are sensitive probes of the dynamics of the early Universe and can provide insights beyond the standard inflationary scenario. While these features have been the focus of extensive studies using cosmic microwave background anisotropy data, large-scale structure surveys now provide the opportunity to probe their effects at smaller scales with higher precision. In this paper, we present a complete description of the nonlinear model for primordial oscillatory features in the context of time-sliced perturbation theory extending the results already presented in the literature. We derive analytical expressions including novel contributions such as the mixed term between primordial oscillations and baryon acoustic oscillations, and we also calculate the corrections arising from the specific envelope of the oscillatory pattern, corresponding to a scale-dependent amplitude. These results are compared with N-body simulations using the COLA method and show consistent behaviour across different scales. Although the corrections are found to be small, they represent an important step towards fully characterising the nonlinear imprints of primordial features on the matter power spectrum. Our results offer new predictions for future cosmological surveys that seek to detect these subtle signatures in the matter distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quark star is such an exotic star of our Universe. The limiting mass for quark stars essentially depends on rotational frequency apart from bag constant and other fundamental parameters. The analytical results obtained agree with the results of several relevant numerical estimates as well as observational evidence. Primordial black hole (PBH) is another hypothetical candidate of compact astrophysical objects. We explore the combined effect of PBH evaporation and the baryon-dark matter (DM) interaction in the 21cm scenario. We address both upper and lower bounds on several PBH and DM parameters using the observational excess (-500^{+200}_{-500} mK) of EDGES's experimental results. A similar investigation has been carried out in the framework of interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We consider three IDE models and eventually measure the allowed limits of IDE coupling parameters for individual cases. Keeping in view of the 21cm scenario, we also explore the multimessenger signals from possible rare decay of fundamental Heavy Dark Matters (HDM). HDM can undergo QCD cascade decay to produce leptons or $\gamma$ as end products. One of the multimessenger signals could be the source of ultra high energy neutrino ($\sim$PeV) signals at the IceCube detector whereas the other signal attributes to the cooling/heating of the baryons due to HDM decay and corresponding influences in the global 21cm signal. The consequence of late time decay of such HDMs may also have significant implications on the aspect of matter-antimatter asymmetry. The mass and lifetime of such Dark Matter particles have been obtained by performing a $\chi^2$ analysis with the PeV neutrino data of IceCube and finally, the amount of baryon asymmetry produced in the Universe is estimated if caused by Dark Matter decay.</description>

      <title>Is bouncing easier with a negative effective dark fluid density ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming that a cosmological model can describe the whole Universe history, we look for the conditions of a cosmological bounce thus in agreement with late time observations. Our approach involves casting such a theory into General Relativity with curvature ($\Omega_{\kappa}$), matter ($\Omega_{m}$), radiation ($\Omega_{r}$) and an effective dark fluid ($\Omega_{d}$) and formulating the corresponding field equations as a 2D dynamical system, wherein phase space points corresponding to extrema of the metric function are constrained by observational data. We show that if this effective dark fluid density is positive at the bounce, these observational constraints imply its occurrence in the future at a redshift $z&lt;-0.81$ whatever the cosmological model (dark energy, brane, $f(R)$, etc.) corresponding to this effective dark fluid and even with a positive curvature. Hence, the effective dark fluid density must be negative at the bounce such as it arises for $z&gt;-0.81$ and thus possibly in the past. Observations also impose that the dark fluid effective density can change sign only within the redshift range $0.54&lt;z&lt;0.61$. We then proceed by examining 3 cosmological models: a non linear dark fluid model, a Randall Sundrum brane model and a $f(R)=R+mR^n+\Lambda$ model. For each of them, we examine the conditions for (1) a bounce at early time, (2) with a negative effective dark fluid energy density, (3) this having to change sign within the above specified redshift interval. We find that none of these three models satisfy all three constraints. We conclude that while a negative effective dark fluid energy density required by observational constraints for a bounce at early times facilitates this bounce, the requirement for $\Omega_d$ to change sign and become positive within the above specified narrow redshift interval proves exceedingly challenging to satisfy these same constraints.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic magnetism in a gamma-ray beam as a model of Porphyrion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the magnetic field in the jets of the recently discovered 7 Mpc long Porphyrion system. We use non-detection of the system in gamma-rays to derive a lower bound on the co-moving magnetic field strength at the level of ~10 nG. This value is consistent with recent estimates of magnetic fields in the filaments of the Large Scale Structure. We discuss the possibility that, instead of being the extreme case of a radio jet formation scenario, Porphyrion actually traces a very-high-energy gamma-ray beam emitted by an active galactic nucleus. In such a model, jets do not need to spread into the voids of the Large Scale Structure to appear straight on a very large distance range, and several anomalies of the standard radio jet scenarios can be solved at once.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating formulas and bounds in oscillating backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we calculate the reheating temperature in the cosmological scenarios where heavy scalar particles are gravitationally produced, due to a conformally coupled interaction between a massive scalar quantum field and the Ricci scalar, during the oscillations of the inflaton field. We explore two distinct cases, namely the one in which these particles decay during the domination of the inflaton's energy density and the other one where the decay occurs after this phase. For each scenario, we have derived formulas to calculate the reheating temperatures based on the energy density of the produced particles and their decay rate. We establish bounds for the maximum reheating temperature, defined as the temperature reached by the universe when the decay of gravitationally produced particles concludes at the onset of the radiation-dominated epoch. Finally, we use the Born approximation to find analytic formulas for the reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse of Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in Generalized Vaidya spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational collapse procedure in generalized Vaidya spacetime with Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter density profile. We use the generalized Vaidya metric to simulate the spacetime of a big star and subsequently obtain the field equations. Then we proceed to determine the star system's mass parameter by solving the field equations. Then the gravitational collapse mechanism is investigated using the derived solutions. Investigating the nature of the singularity (if formed) as the end state of the collapse is the main goal. Dark matter in the form of Bose-Einstein condensate is expected to play a crucial role in the fate of the collapse. We see that there is a possibility of the formation of both black holes and naked singularities as the end state of the collapse depending upon the initial conditions. The junction conditions are derived with a Vaidya exterior and a Friedmann interior and some important insights are obtained. A Penrose diagram showing the causal relations between the spacetimes is generated and studied in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model is in the midst of a stress test, thanks to the tension between supernovae-based measurements of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and inferences of its values from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Numerous explanations for the present-day cosmic acceleration require the presence of a new fundamental scalar field, as do Early Dark Energy (EDE) solutions to the Hubble tension. This raises the possibility that multiple fields cooperatively contribute to the dark energy component in bursts throughout cosmic time due to distinct initial conditions and couplings. Here, this Cascading Dark Energy (CDE) scenario is illustrated through a realization that effectively reduces to a two-field model, with two epochs in which dark energy is cosmologically significant. The model is compared to measurements of the CMB, baryon acoustic oscillations, as well as both PANTHEON and SH0ES observations of Type-Ia supernovae. Neglecting the linear perturbations, it is found that this scenario ameliorates the Hubble tension, improving over purely late-time models of dark energy, and the agreement between the galaxy survey measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Classifying Modified Gravity and Dark Energy Theories with Bayesian Neural Networks: Massive Neutrinos, Baryonic Feedback, and the Theoretical Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the capacity of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to detect new physics in the dark matter power spectrum. As in previous studies, the Bayesian Cosmological Network (BaCoN) classifies spectra into one of 5 classes: $\Lambda$CDM, $f(R)$, $w$CDM, Dvali-Gabadaze-Porrati (DGP) gravity and a 'random' class, with this work extending it to include the effects of massive neutrinos and baryonic feedback. We further develop the treatment of theoretical errors in BaCoN-II, investigating several approaches and identifying the one that best allows the trained network to generalise to other power spectrum modelling prescriptions. In particular, we compare power spectra data produced by EuclidEmulator2, HMcode and halofit, all supplemented with the halo model reaction to model beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics. We investigate BNN-classifiers trained on these sets of spectra, adding in Stage-IV survey noise and various theoretical error models. Using our optimal theoretical error model, our fiducial classifier achieves a total classification accuracy of $\sim$ 95% when it is trained on EuclidEmulator2-based spectra with modification parameters drawn from a Gaussian distribution centred around $\Lambda$CDM ($f(R)$: $\sigma_{fR0} = 10^{-5.5}$, DGP: $\sigma_{r\mathrm{c}} = 0.173$, $w$CDM: $\sigma_{w0} = 0.097$, $\sigma_{wa}=0.32$). This strengthens the promise of this method to glean the maximal amount of unbiased gravitational and cosmological information from forthcoming Stage-IV galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 VI: Cosmological Constraints from the Measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological results from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers from the first year of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), to be released in the DESI Data Release 1. DESI BAO provide robust measurements of the transverse comoving distance and Hubble rate, or their combination, relative to the sound horizon, in seven redshift bins from over 6 million extragalactic objects in the redshift range $0.1&lt;z&lt;4.2$. DESI BAO data alone are consistent with the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with a matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.295\pm 0.015$. Paired with a BBN prior and the robustly measured acoustic angular scale from the CMB, DESI requires $H_0=(68.52\pm0.62)$ km/s/Mpc. In conjunction with CMB anisotropies from Planck and CMB lensing data from Planck and ACT, we find $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.307\pm 0.005$ and $H_0=(67.97\pm0.38)$ km/s/Mpc. Extending the baseline model with a constant dark energy equation of state parameter $w$, DESI BAO alone require $w=-0.99^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$. In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, combinations of DESI with CMB or with SN~Ia individually prefer $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. This preference is 2.6$\sigma$ for the DESI+CMB combination, and persists or grows when SN~Ia are added in, giving results discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the $2.5\sigma$, $3.5\sigma$ or $3.9\sigma$ levels for the addition of Pantheon+, Union3, or DES-SN5YR datasets respectively. For the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with the sum of neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ free, combining the DESI and CMB data yields an upper limit $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072$ $(0.113)$ eV at 95% confidence for a $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$ $(\sum m_\nu&gt;0.059)$ eV prior. These neutrino-mass constraints are substantially relaxed in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. [Abridged.]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unified dark fluid model unifies dark matter and dark energy into a single component, providing an alternative and more concise framework for interpreting cosmological observations. We introduce a PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid (PUDF) model based on the PAge approximation (Huang 2020), which is parameterized by the age of the universe and an $\eta$ parameter indicating the deviation from Einstein-De Sitter Universe. The PUDF model shares many similar features of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and can effectively describe the large-scale structure formation and late-time cosmic acceleration. We constrain the PUDF model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements including those from the most recent DESI 2024, the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and the Cosmic Chronometers compilation. Although the PUDF performs well in fitting all the cosmological datasets, the joint analysis of the data still favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the PUDF model, according to the Bayesian evidence of model comparison.</description>

      <title>Conversations in the dark: cross-correlating birefringence and LSS to constrain axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unveiling the dark sector of the Universe is one of the leading efforts in theoretical physics. Among the many models proposed, axions and axion-like particles stand out due to their solid theoretical foundation, capacity to contribute significantly to both dark matter and dark energy, and potential to address the small-scale crisis of $\Lambda$CDM. Moreover, these pseudo-scalar fields couple to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons parity-violating term, leading to a rotation of the plane of linearly polarized waves, namely cosmic birefringence. We explore the impact of the axion-parameters on anisotropic birefringence and study, for the first time, its cross-correlation with the spatial distribution of galaxies, focusing on ultralight axions with masses $10^{-33}\,{\rm eV}\le m_\phi\le10^{-28}\,{\rm eV}$. Through this novel approach, we investigate the axion-parameter space in the mass $m_\phi$ and initial misalignment angle $\theta_i$, within the framework of early dark energy models, and constrain the axion-photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma}$ required to achieve unity in the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying cross-correlation, computed with the instrument specifications of Euclid and forthcoming CMB-polarization data. Our findings reveal that for masses below $10^{-32}\,{\rm eV}$ and initial misalignment angles greater in absolute value than $\pi/4$, the signal-to-noise ratio not only exceeds unity but also surpasses that achievable from the auto-correlation of birefringence alone (up to a factor 7), highlighting the informative potential of this new probe. Additionally, given the late-time evolution of these low-mass axions, the signal stems from the epoch of reionization, providing an excellent tool to single out the birefringence generated during this period.</description>

      <title>Detecting Relativistic Doppler by Multi-Tracing a Single Galaxy Population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New data from ongoing galaxy surveys, such as the $Euclid$ satellite and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), are expected to unveil physics on the largest scales of our universe. Dramatically affected by cosmic variance, these scales are of interest to large-scale structure studies as they exhibit relevant corrections due to general relativity (GR) in the $n$-point statistics of cosmological random fields. We focus on the relativistic, sample-dependent Doppler contribution to the observed clustering of galaxies, whose detection will further confirm the validity of GR in cosmological regimes. Sample- and scale-dependent, the Doppler term is more likely to be detected via cross-correlation measurements, where it acts as an imaginary correction to the power spectrum of fluctuations in galaxy number counts. We present a method allowing us to exploit multi-tracer benefits from a single data set, by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples, according to galaxies' luminosity/magnitude. To overcome cosmic variance we rely on a multi-tracer approach, and to maximise the detectability of the relativistic Doppler contribution in the data, we optimise sample selection. As a result, we find the optimal split and forecast the relativistic Doppler detection significance for both a DESI-like Bright Galaxy Sample and a $Euclid$-like H$\alpha$ galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories are the most general scalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and a single scalar field and its derivatives up to second order. They propagate only one scalar degree of freedom, without being plagued by Ostrogradsky instabilities. This is achieved through certain degeneracies of the functions forming their Lagrangian. They generalise the Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories. Originally proposed to describe the late-time acceleration of the expansion of the universe, generalising the cosmological constant, they can also be used to build models of the early universe, to describe inflation or alternatives to standard inflation. In the late universe, they modify the standard Vainstein screening mechanism from Horndeski theories (which can have observable consequences) and are suited to build black hole models, featuring non-stealth Kerr black hole solutions. In this work their phenomenology is reviewed, looking at their basic properties, their parameterisations and classifications, focusing on solutions in the early and the late universe and at cosmological and astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>

      <title>On marginals and profiled posteriors for cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With several examples and in an analysis of the Pantheon+ supernova sample we discuss the properties of the marginal posterior distribution versus the profiled posterior distribution -- the profile likelihood in a Bayesian disguise. We investigate whether maximisation, as used for the profiling, or integration, as used for the marginalisation, is more appropriate. To report results we recommend the marginal posterior distribution.</description>

      <title>Elementary considerations on gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the main properties of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by transient hyperbolic encounters of black holes. We begin by building the set of basic variables most relevant to setting our problem. After exposing the ranges of masses and eccentricities accessible at a given GW frequency, we analyze the dependence of the gravitational strain on those parameters and determine the trajectories resulting in the most sizeable strains. Some non-trivial behaviors are unveiled, showing that highly eccentric events can be more easily detectable than parabolic ones. In particular, we underline the correct way to extend formulas from hyperbolic to parabolic orbits. Our reasonings are as general as possible, and we make a point of explaining our considerations pedagogically. The majority of the work is based on Newtonian dynamics and aims at being a benchmark to which more accurate calculations can be compared.</description>

      <title>Detecting unresolved lensed SNe Ia in LSST using blended light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe) are promising probes for providing absolute distance measurements using gravitational-lens time delays. Spatially unresolved LSNe offer an opportunity to enhance the sample size for precision cosmology. We predict that there will be approximately three times as many unresolved as resolved LSNe Ia in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the {\it Rubin} Observatory. In this article, we explore the feasibility of detecting unresolved LSNe Ia from a pool of preclassified SNe Ia light curves using the shape of the blended light curves with deep-learning techniques. We find that $\sim 30\%$ unresolved LSNe Ia can be detected with a simple 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) using well-sampled $rizy$-band light curves (with a false-positive rate of $\sim 3\%$). Even when the light curve is well observed in only a single band among $r$, $i$, and $z$, detection is still possible with false-positive rates ranging from $\sim 4$ to $7\%$ depending on the band. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these unresolved cases can be detected at an early stage using light curves up to $\sim20$ days from the first observation with well-controlled false-positive rates, providing ample opportunity to trigger follow-up observations. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of time-delay estimations using solely LSST-like data of unresolved light curves, particularly for doubles, when excluding systems with low time delays and magnification ratios. However, the abundance of such systems among those unresolved in LSST poses a significant challenge. This approach holds potential utility for upcoming wide-field surveys, and overall results could significantly improve with enhanced cadence and depth in the future surveys.</description>

      <title>Superpotential method and the amplification of inflationary perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superpotential method is a reconstruction technique which has proven useful to build exact cosmological solutions. We here employ the superpotential method in order to reconstruct the features necessary for the inflaton potential to drive inflation and lead to the amplification of the curvature perturbations. Such an amplification, at wavelengths shorter than those observed in the cosmic microwave background, is necessary in order to have a significant formation of primordial black holes after inflation ends. The technique is applied to the cases of a minimally coupled inflaton, to the nonminimal coupling case and to $f(R)$ theories of gravity. For such theories, a model dependent analysis of the features leading to the scalar spectrum enhancement is also presented.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes in Induced Gravity Inflationary Models with Two Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-field inflationary model with the induced gravity term. Using conformal transformation of the metric, we get the chiral cosmological model with two scalar fields. We demonstrate that the constructed inflationary model does not contradict to the recent observation data and is suitable for primordial black hole (PBH) formation. The estimation of PBH masses allows to consider PBHs as dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Thermal pressure on ultrarelativistic bubbles from a semiclassical formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a planar bubble wall that is traveling at an ultrarelativistic speed through a thermal plasma. This situation may arise during a first-order electroweak phase transition in the early universe. As particles cross the wall, it is assumed that their mass grows from $m_a$ to $m_b$, and they are decelerated causing them to emit massless radiation ($m_c=0$). We are interested in the momentum transfer to the wall, the thermal pressure felt by the wall, and the resultant terminal velocity of the wall. We employ the semiclassical current radiation (SCR) formalism to perform these calculations. An incident-charged particle is treated as a point-like classical electromagnetic current, and the spectrum of quantum electromagnetic radiation (photons) is derived by calculating appropriate matrix elements. To understand how the spectrum depends on the thickness of the wall, we explore simplified models for the current corresponding to an abrupt and a gradual deceleration. For the model of abrupt deceleration, we find that the SCR formalism can reproduce the $P_\mathrm{therm} \propto \gamma_w^0$ scaling found in earlier work by assuming that the emission is soft, but if the emission is not soft the SCR formalism can be used to obtain $P_\mathrm{therm} \propto \gamma_w^2$ instead. For the model of gradual deceleration, we find that the wall thickness $L_w$ enters to cutoff the otherwise log-flat radiation spectrum above a momentum of $\sim \gamma_w^2 / L_w$, and we discuss the connections with classical electromagnetic bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetogenesis in a bouncing model with dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate primordial magnetogenesis within a quantum bouncing model driven by a scalar field, focusing on various non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field and the scalar field. We test three cases: no coupling, a Cauchy coupling with gradual decay, and a Gaussian coupling with rapid fall-off. By exploring these scenarios, we assess a wide range of coupling strengths across different scales. The scalar field, with an exponential potential, behaves as pressureless matter in the asymptotic past of the contracting phase, as stiff matter around the bounce, and as dark energy during the expanding phase. Our findings reveal that, among the tested cases, only the Gaussian coupling can explain the generation of primordial magnetic fields on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Bound on Light Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a robust bound on dark photon dark matter scenarios where the dark photon mass is generated through the Higgs mechanism, based on the requirement that symmetry breaking must occur sufficiently early in the universe. We emphasize that dark photon production occurs successfully when the dark Higgs field remains in the symmetric phase due to non-thermal trapping effects. For renormalizable Higgs potentials, our bound reads $$\frac{m_{\gamma'}}{q_H e_H}\; \gg \;60\,{\rm eV}\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^{1/4}$$ where $m_{\gamma'}$ is the dark photon mass, $e_H$ is the gauge coupling, $q_H$ is the charge of the dark Higgs boson, and $\lambda$ is the Higgs quartic coupling. This constraint holds independently of any complications arising from the Schwinger effect and vortex formation in the Higgsed phase. For more general Higgs potentials such as the Coleman-Weinberg type potential, our bound yields different forms. We argue that late-time symmetry breaking of the dark U(1) symmetry satisfying the bound has only a mild impact on both the abundance and momentum distribution of dark photon dark matter, and therefore does not pose any serious problem for the dark photon dark matter scenario.</description>
