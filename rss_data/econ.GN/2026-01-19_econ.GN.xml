      <title>Beyond Unidimensionality: General Factors and Residual Heterogeneity in Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do evaluation systems compress multidimensional performance information into summary ratings? Using expert assessments of 9,669 professional soccer players on 28 attributes, we characterize the dimensional structure of evaluation outputs. The first principal component explains 40.6% of attribute variance, indicating a strong general factor, but formal noise discrimination procedures retain four components and bootstrap resampling confirms that this structure is highly stable. Internal consistency is high without evidence of redundancy. In out of sample prediction of expert overall ratings, a comprehensive model using the full attribute set substantially outperforms a single-factor summary (cross-validated R squared = 0.814). Overall, performance evaluations exhibit moderate information compression; they combine shared variance with stable residual dimensions that are economically meaningful for evaluation outcomes, with direct implications for the design of measurement systems.</description>

      <title>Distributional Treatment Effects of Content Promotion: Evidence from an ABEMA Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of top-of-screen promotions on viewing time at ABEMA, a leading video streaming platform in Japan. To this end, we conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial. Given the non-standard distribution of user viewing times, we estimate distributional treatment effects. Our estimation results document that spotlighting content through these promotions effectively boosts user engagement across diverse content types. Notably, promoting short content proves most effective in that it not only retains users but also motivates them to watch subsequent episodes.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and the US Economy: An Accounting Perspective on Investment and Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has moved to the center of policy, market, and academic debates, but its macroeconomic footprint is still only partly understood. This paper provides an overview on how the current AI wave is captured in US national accounts, combining a simple macro-accounting framework with a stylized description of the AI production process. We highlight the crucial role played by data centers, which constitute the backbone of the AI ecosystem and have attracted formidable investment in 2025, as they are indispensable for meeting the rapidly increasing worldwide demand for AI services. We document that the boom in IT and AI-related capital expenditure in the first three quarters of the year has given an outsized boost to aggregate demand, while its contribution to GDP growth is smaller once the high import content of AI hardware is netted out. Furthermore, simple calculations suggest that, at current utilization rates and pricing, the production of services originating in new AI data centers could contribute to GDP over the turn of the next quarters on a scale comparable to that of investment spending to date. Short reinvestment cycles and uncertainty about future AI demand, while not currently acting as a macroeconomic drag, can nevertheless fuel macroeconomic risks over the medium term.</description>

      <title>The hidden structure of innovation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Innovation emerges from complex collaboration patterns - among inventors, firms, or institutions. However, not much is known about the overall mesoscopic structure around which inventive activity self-organizes. Here, we tackle this problem by employing patent data to analyze both individual (co-inventorship) and organization (co-ownership) networks in three strategic domains (artificial intelligence, biotechnology and semiconductors). We characterize the mesoscale structure (in terms of clusters) of each domain by comparing two alternative methods: a standard baseline - modularity maximization - and one based on the minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion, within the Stochastic Block Model and its degree-corrected variant. We find that, across sectors, inventor networks are denser and more clustered than organization ones - consistent with the presence of small recurrent teams embedded into broader institutional hierarchies - whereas organization networks have neater hierarchical role-based structures, with few bridging firms coordinating the most peripheral ones. We also find that the discovered meso-structures are connected to innovation output. In particular, Lorenz curves of forward citations show a pervasive inequality in technological influence: across sectors and methods, both inventor (especially) and organization networks consistently show high levels of concentration of citations in a few of the discovered clusters. Our results demonstrate that the baseline modularity-based method may not be capable of fully capturing the way collaborations drive the spreading of inventive impact across technological domains. This is due to the presence of local hierarchies that call for more refined tools based on Bayesian inference.</description>
