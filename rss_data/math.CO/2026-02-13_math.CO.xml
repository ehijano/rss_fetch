      <title>Characterizing graphs with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than -1/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with vertex set $V$. The distance, $d_G(u, v)$, between vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$ is defined as the length of a shortest path between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. The distance matrix of $G$ is the matrix $\mathbf{D}(G) =[d_G(u, v)]_{u,v\in V}$. The second largest distance eigenvalue $\lambda_2(G)$ of $G$ is the second largest one in the spectrum of $\mathbf{D}(G)$.
  In this work, we completely characterize the connected graphs $G$ for which $\lambda_2(G)&lt;-1/2$ through approaches both spectral and structural.</description>

      <title>On the combinatorics of Murai spheres and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the combinatorial types of Murai spheres in dimensions $1$ and $2$, thereby showing that the corresponding convex simple polytopes have Delzant realizations. Then we describe all chordal Murai spheres $\mathrm{Bier}_c(M)$ with $c\in\mathbb N^m$ and $m\leq 2$. Finally, we find all possible values for the Buchstaber and chromatic numbers of arbitrary Murai spheres.</description>

      <title>The Topology of $k$-Robust Clique Complexes in Grid-like Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $k$-robust clique complexes, a family of simplicial complexes that generalizes the traditional clique complex. Here, a subset of vertices forms a simplex provided it does not contain an independent set of size $k$.
  We investigate these complexes for square sequence graphs, a class of bipartite graphs introduced here that are constructed by iteratively attaching $C_4$ cycles. This class includes rectangular grid graphs $G_{m,n}$. We show that for $k=2$ and $k=3$, the homotopy type is a wedge sum of $(2k-3)$-dimensional spheres, a result we extend to arbitrary $k$ under specific structural constraints on the attachment sequence.
  Our approach utilizes K\"{o}nig's theorem to decompose the complex into manageable components, whose homotopy types are easy to understand. This then enables an inductive proof based on the decomposition and standard tools of algebraic topology. Finally, we utilize Alexander duality to connect our results to the study of total-$k$-cut complexes, generalizing recent results concerning the homotopy types of total-$k$-cut complexes for grid graphs.</description>

      <title>Block Stacking, Airplane Refueling, and Robust Appointment Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can a stack of identical blocks be arranged to extend beyond the edge of a table as far as possible? We consider a generalization of this classic puzzle to blocks that differ in width and mass. Despite the seemingly simple premise, we demonstrate that it is unlikely that one can efficiently determine a stack configuration of maximum overhang. Formally, we prove that the Block-Stacking Problem is NP-hard, partially answering an open question from the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the restriction to stacks without counterweights has a surprising connection to the Airplane Refueling Problem, another famous puzzle, and to Robust Appointment Scheduling, a problem of practical relevance. In addition to revealing a remarkable relation to the real-world challenge of devising schedules under uncertainty, their equivalence unveils a polynomial-time approximation scheme, that is, a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, for Block Stacking without counterbalancing and a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the general case.</description>

      <title>Tur\'{a}n extremal graphs vs. Signless Laplacian spectral Tur\'{a}n extremal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a graph with chromatic number $\chi(F) = r+1$. Denote by $ex(n, F)$ and $Ex(n, F)$ the Tur\'{a}n number and the set of all extremal graphs for $F$, respectively. In addition, $ex_{ssp}(n, F)$ and $Ex_{ssp}(n, F)$ are the maximum signless Laplacian spectral radius of all $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs and the set of all $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs with signless Laplacian spectral radius $ex_{ssp}(n, F)$, respectively. It is known that $Ex_{ssp}(n, F)\supset Ex(n, F)$ if $F$ is a triangle. In this paper, employing the regularity method and F\"{u}redi's stability theorem, we prove that for a given graph $F$ and $r\geqslant 3$, if $ex(n, F) = t_r(n)+O(1)$, then $ Ex_{ssp}(n, F) \subseteq Ex(n, F)$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $t_r(n)$ is the number of edges in the Tur\'{a}n graph $T_r(n)$.</description>

      <title>$s$-almost cross-$t$-intersecting families for vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F} _{q} $, and ${V\brack k}$ denote the family of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. The families $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}\subseteq {V\brack k}$ are said to be cross-$t$-intersecting if $\dim(F\cap G)\ge t$ for all $F\in \mathcal{F}, G\in \mathcal{G}$. Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are called $s$-almost cross-$t$-intersecting if each member of $\mathcal{F}$ (resp. $\mathcal{G}$) is $t$-disjoint with at most $s$ members of $\mathcal{G}$ (resp. $\mathcal{F}$). In this paper, we discribe the structure of $s$-almost cross-$t$-intersecting families with maximum product of their sizes. In addition, we prove a stability result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1987, Frankl proved an influential stability result for the Erd\H os--Ko--Rado theorem, which bounds the size of an intersecting family in terms of its distance from the nearest (subset of) star or trivial intersecting family. It is a far-reaching extension of the Hilton--Milner theorem. In this paper, we prove its analogue for permutations on $\{1,\ldots, n\}$, provided $n$ is large. This provides a similar extension of a Hilton--Milner type result for permutations proved by Ellis.</description>

      <title>Metric basis and dimension of barycentric subdivision of zero divisor graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity 1, and $ G(V,E)$ be a simple, connected, nontrivial graph. Let $d(a,c)$ be the distance between the vertices $a$ and $c $ in $G$. An undirected zero divisor graph of a ring $R$ is denoted by $\Gamma(R) = (V(\Gamma(R)), E(\Gamma(R)))$, where the vertex set $V(\Gamma(R))$ consists of all the non-zero zero-divisors of $R$, and the edge set $E(\Gamma(R))$ is defined as follows: $E(\Gamma(R)) = $ $\{e = a_1a_2$ $ |$ $ a_1 \cdot a_2 = 0$ $\&amp;$ $ a_1, a_2 \in V(\Gamma(R))\}$. In this article, we consider the zero divisor graph of a group of integers modulo \(n\), denoted as \(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_n)\), where \(n=pq\). Here, \(p\) and \(q\) are distinct primes, with \(q &gt; p\). We aim to determine the metric dimension of the barycentric subdivision of the zero divisor graph \(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_n)\), denoted by \(dim(BS(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_n)))\), and we also prove that \(dim(BS(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_n)))\geq q-2\) for every \(n=pq\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are distinct primes and $q&gt;p$.</description>

      <title>Improved Universal Graphs for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is universal for a class of graphs $\mathcal{C}$, if, up to isomorphism, $G$ contains every graph in $\mathcal{C}$ as a subgraph. In 1978, Chung and Graham asked for the minimal number $s(n)$ of edges in a graph with $n$ vertices that is universal for all trees with $n$ vertices. The currently best bounds assert that $n\ln n-O(n)\le s(n) \le C n\ln n+O(n)$, where $C = \frac{14}{5\ln 2} \approx 4.04$. Here, we improve the upper bound to $c n\ln n + O(n)$, where $c = \frac{19}{6\ln 3} \approx 2.88$. We develop in the proof a strategy that, broadly speaking, is based on separating trees into three parts, thus enabling us to embed them in a structure that originates from ternary trees.
  Our method also applies to graphs that are close to being trees, measured by their treewidth. Let $s_w(n)$ be the minimum number of edges in a $n$-vertex graph that is universal for graphs with treewidth $w$. By performing a graph blow-up to our universal structure and counting necessary edges carefully, we establish that $nw \ln(n/w) -O(nw) \leq s_w(n) \leq \frac{19}{6\ln3} n (w+1) \ln(n/w) + O(nw)$.</description>

      <title>On plane rigidity matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several results about matroids and matroidal families associated with rigidity in dimension $2$. In particular, we establish new properties of the generic rigidity matroid family $\mathcal{R}$ and Kalai's hyperconnectivity matroid family $\mathcal{H}$.
  We show that $\mathcal{R}$ is the unique matroidal $2$-rigidity family in which $K_{3,3}$ is not a circuit. As a geometric corollary of this result and the Bolker-Roth theorem, it follows that $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are the only $2$-rigidity families associated with algebraic curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  Bernstein used tropical geometry to characterize $\mathcal{H}$-independent graphs as those admitting an edge-ordering without directed cycles and alternating closed trails. We provide a combinatorial proof of the sufficiency direction and extend Bernstein's theorem to positive characteristic. It follows that the wedge power matroid of $n$ generic points in dimension $n-2$ does not depend on the field characteristic.
  Our proof method allows to identify many graphs that are independent in every $2$-rigidity family. In particular, we show this for all connected cubic graphs, with exceptions of $K_4$ and $K_{3,3}$. This gives a complete classification of cubic graphs in this respect and answers a question of Kalai in a strong form.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new property of cubic graphs: every connected cubic graph except $K_4$ and $K_{3,3}$ has an orientation without directed and alternating cycles. Equivalently, it can be edge-partitioned into two forests in a special `interlocked' way.</description>

      <title>A positive instance of Scott's Conjecture on induced subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$ and $\omega(G)$ denotes the size of the largest clique in $G$. A hereditary class of graphs is called $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that for each graph $G$ in the class, $\chi(G) \le f(\omega(G))$.
  Scott (1997) conjectured that for every graph $H$, the class of graphs which do not contain any subdivision of $H$ as an induced subgraph is $\chi$-bounded. He proved his conjecture when $H$ is a tree and when $H$ is the complete graph on four vertices, $K_4$. Esperet and Trotignon (2019) proved that the conjecture holds when $H$ is $K_4$ with one edge subdivided once.
  Scott's conjecture was disproved by Pawlik et al. (2014). Chalopin et al. (2016) gave more counterexamples including the graph obtained from $K_4$ by subdividing each edge of a 4-cycle once.
  We prove that the conjecture holds when $H$ consists of a complete bipartite graph with and additional vertex which has exactly two neighbours, on the same side of the bipartition. As a special case, this proves Scott's conjecture when $H$ is obtained from $K_4$ by subdividing two disjoint edges.</description>

      <title>On minimal pattern-containing inversion sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of minimal inversion sequences for a pattern $\rho$, which form the smallest set of inversion sequences whose avoidance is equivalent to the avoidance of $\rho$ for inversion sequences. We give a characterization of $\rho$-minimal inversion sequences based on the occurrences of the pattern $\rho$ they contain, and use it to find upper and lower bounds on the lengths of $\rho$-minimal inversion sequences. We provide some enumerative results on the exact number of minimal inversion sequences for some patterns, through a bijection with increasing trees, and some exhaustive generation. Lastly, we enumerate inversion sequences which are equal to their reduction, and find an interesting connection with poly-Bernoulli numbers.</description>

      <title>How Many Features Can a Language Model Store Under the Linear Representation Hypothesis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which asserts that intermediate layers of language models store features linearly. We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.
  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = \Omega_\epsilon(\frac{k^2}{\log k}\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_\epsilon(k^2\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the "superposition hypothesis" (Elhage et al., 2022).
  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Tur\'an's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs). We also show how our results do and do not constrain the geometry of feature representations and extend our results to allow decoders with an activation function and bias.</description>

      <title>An Improved Upper Bound for the Euclidean TSP Constant Using Band Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider $n$ points generated uniformly at random in the unit square, and let $L_n$ be the length of their optimal traveling salesman tour. Beardwood, Halton, and Hammersley (1959) showed $L_n / \sqrt n \to \beta$ almost surely as $n\to \infty$ for some constant $\beta$. The exact value of $\beta$ is unknown but estimated to be approximately $0.71$ (Applegate, Bixby, Chv\'atal, Cook 2011). Beardwood et al. further showed that $0.625 \leq \beta \leq 0.92116.$ Currently, the best known bounds are $0.6277 \leq \beta \leq 0.90380$, due to Gaudio and Jaillet (2019) and Carlsson and Yu (2023), respectively. The upper bound was derived using a computer-aided approach that is amenable to lower bounds with improved computation speed. In this paper, we show via simulation and concentration analysis that future improvement of the $0.90380$ is limited to $\sim0.88$. Moreover, we provide an alternative tour-constructing heuristic that, via simulation, could potentially improve the upper bound to $\sim0.85$. Our approach builds on a prior \emph{band-traversal} strategy, initially proposed by Beardwood et al. (1959) and subsequently refined by Carlsson and Yu (2023): divide the unit square into bands of height $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$, construct paths within each band, and then connect the paths to create a TSP tour. Our approach allows paths to cross bands, and takes advantage of pairs of points in adjacent bands which are close to each other. A rigorous numerical analysis improves the upper bound to $0.90367$.</description>

      <title>Universal Ahlfors--David regularity of Steiner trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Steiner tree problem is the problem of finding a set $\St$ of minimum one-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\H$ (length) such that $\St \cup \mathcal{A}$ is connected, where $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a given compact set.
  Paolini and Stepanov provided very general existence and regularity results for the Steiner problem.
  Their main regularity result is that under a natural assumption, $\H(\St) &lt; \infty$, for almost every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ the set $\St_\varepsilon := \St\setminus B_\varepsilon(\mathcal A)$ is an embedded finite forest (acyclic graph).
  We give a quantitative regularity result by proving that the set $\St_\varepsilon$ is Ahlfors--David regular with constants that depend only on $d$ (and not on $\mathcal{A}$). Namely, for $d &gt; 2$, every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, every $x \in \St_\varepsilon$, and every choice of $\rho \in (0,1)$, we have
  \[
  \frac{\H(\St_\varepsilon \cap B_{\rho \varepsilon}(x))}{\varepsilon} \leq \left ( \frac{64d}{1-\rho} \right) ^{d-2}.
  \]
  As a corollary, we obtain a density-type result, i.e. that the set $\St_\varepsilon \cap B_{\rho \varepsilon}(x)$ consists of at most
  \[
  \left ( \frac{64d}{1-\rho} \right) ^{d-1}
  \]
  line segments.
  In the plane (i.e., for $d=2$), it is possible to obtain tight structural results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding, for a given one-dimensional topological space $X$, a cover of $X$ of smallest size by geodesics with respect to some metric. The infimal size of such a set is called the metric geodesic cover number of $X$. We prove reductions enabling us to find, with computer assistance, optimal geodesic covers of a graph and use these to determine the cover number of several standard graphs, including $K_4$, $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$. We also give a catalogue of topological spaces with cover number $3$, and use it to deduce that any such space must be planar.</description>

      <title>Cycles of Well-Linked Sets II: an Elementary Bound for the Directed Grid Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer proved the Directed Grid Theorem - the generalisation of the well-known Excluded Grid Theorem to directed graphs - confirming a conjecture by Reed, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas from the mid-nineties. The theorem states that there is a function $f$ such that every digraph of directed treewidth $f(k)$ contains a cylindrical grid of order $k$ as a butterfly minor. However, the given function grows faster than any non-elementary function of the size of the grid minor. More precisely, it is larger than a power tower whose height depends on the size of the grid.
  In this paper, we present an alternative proof of the Directed Grid Theorem which is conceptually much simpler, more modular in composition and improves the upper bound for the function $f$ to a power tower of height $22$.
  A key concept of our proof is a new structure called cycles of well-linked sets (CWS). We show that any digraph of large directed treewidth contains a large CWS, which in turn contains a large cylindrical grid.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Complexity of Directed Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a directed graph $G$, and a linear order $\ll$ on the vertices of $G$,
  we define backedge graph $G^\ll$ to be the undirected graph on the same vertex set with edge $\{u,w\}$ in $G^\ll$ if and only if $(u,w)$ is an arc in $G$ and $w \ll u$.
  The directed clique number of a directed graph $G$ is defined as the minimum size of the maximum clique in the backedge graph $G^\ll$ taken over all linear orders $\ll$ on the vertices of $G$.
  A natural computational problem is to decide for a given directed graph $G$ and a positive integer $t$, if the directed clique number of $G$ is at most $t$.
  This problem has polynomial algorithm for $t=1$ and is known to be \NP-complete for every fixed $t\ge3$, even for tournaments.
  In this note we prove that this problem is $\Sigma^\mathsf{P}_{2}$-complete when $t$ is given on the input.</description>

      <title>Series involving central binomial coefficients and harmonic numbers of order 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive modular parametrizations for certain infinite series whose summands involve central binomial coefficients and second-order harmonic numbers. When the rates of convergence are certain rational numbers, modularity allows us to reduce the corresponding series to special values of the Dirichlet $L$-values. For example, we establish the following identity that has been recently conjectured by Sun:\[\sum_{k=0}^\infty\binom{2k}{k}^3\left[ \mathsf H_{2k}^{(2)}-\frac{25}{92}\mathsf H_{ k}^{(2)} +\frac{735L_{-7}(2)-86\pi^{2}}{1104}\right]\frac{1}{4096^{k}}=0,\] where $ \mathsf H^{(2)}_k:= \sum_{0&lt;j\leq k}\frac{1}{j^2}$ and $ L_{-7}(2):= \sum_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac{-7}{n}\right)\frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}-\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{4^{2}}-\frac{1}{5^{2}}-\frac{1}{6^{2}}+\frac{1}{8^{2}}+\cdots $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a finite simple graph. In this paper, we characterize the degree of the $h$-polynomial of the edge ideal of $G$ in terms of the independence number of $G$. The key tools are the value of the independence polynomial of $G$ at $-1$ and its derivative. Using this approach, we obtain, in particular, combinatorial formulas for the degree of the $h$-polynomial of paths, cycles, bipartite graphs, Cameron-Walker graphs and antiregular graphs.</description>

      <title>On real algebraic realization of round fold maps of codimension $-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical projections of the unit spheres are generalized to special generic maps and round fold maps, for example. They are generalizations from the viewpoint of singularity theory of differentiable maps and these maps restrict the topologies and the differentiable structures of the manifolds.
  We are concerned with round fold maps, defined as smooth maps locally represented as the product map of a Morse function and the identity map on a smooth manifold, and maps with singular value sets being concentric spheres. A bit different from differential topology, we are concerned with real algebraic geometric aspects of these maps. We discuss real algebraic realization of round fold maps of codimension $-1$ as our new work. Real algebraic realization of these maps is of fundamental and important studies in real algebraic geometry and a new study recently developing mainly due to the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $\mu$ an edge percolation measure on the infinite square lattice, let $\mu_{\textit{hp}}$ (respectively, $\mu^*_{hp}$) denote its marginal (respectively, the marginal of its planar dual process) on the upper half-plane. We show that if $\mu$ is translation-invariant and ergodic and almost surely has only finitely many infinite clusters, then either almost surely $\mu_{hp}$ has no infinite cluster, or almost surely $\mu^*_{hp}$ has no infinite cluster. By the classical Burton--Keane argument, these hypotheses are satisfied if $\mu$ is translation-invariant and ergodic and has finite-energy. In contrast to previous ``non-coexistence'' theorems, our result does not impose a positive-correlation (FKG) hypothesis on $\mu$. Our arguments also apply to the random-cluster model (including the regime $q&lt;1$, which lacks FKG), the uniform spanning tree, and the uniform odd subgraph.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the asymptotic properties of hook numbers of partitions in restricted classes. More specifically, we compare the frequency with which partitions into odd parts and partitions into distinct parts have hook numbers equal to $h \geq 1$ by deriving an asymptotic formula for the total number of hooks equal to $h$ that appear among partitions into odd and distinct parts, respectively. We use these asymptotic formulas to prove a recent conjecture of the first author and collaborators that for $h \geq 2$ and $n \gg 0$, partitions into odd parts have, on average, more hooks equal to $h$ than do partitions into distinct parts. We also use our asymptotics to prove certain probabilistic statements about how hooks distribute in the rows of partitions.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Bonini et al. on the precise values of the Lin--Lu--Yau curvature of conference graphs, i.e., strongly regular graphs with parameters $(4\gamma+1,2\gamma,\gamma-1,\gamma)$. Our method depends only on the parameter relations and applies to broader classes of amply regular graphs. In particular, we develop a new combinatorial approach to show the existence of local perfect matchings. A key observation is that counting common neighbors leads to useful quadratic polynomials. As a corollary, we derive an interesting number-theoretic result concerning quadratic residues.</description>

Abstract: We establish an upper bound on the minimum codegree necessary for the existence of spanning, fractional Steiner triple systems in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. This improves upon a result by Lee in 2023. In particular, together with results from Lee's paper, our results imply that if $n$ is sufficiently large and satisfies some necessary divisibility conditions, then a $3$-uniform, $n$-vertex hypergraph $H$ contains a Steiner triple system if every pair of vertices forms an edge in $H$ with at least $0.8579n$ other vertices.</description>

      <title>The $k$-fold circuit property for matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double circuits were introduced by Lov\'{a}sz in 1980 as a fundamental tool in his derivation of a min-max formula for the size of a maximum matching in linear matroids. This formula was extended to all matroids satisfying the so-called `double circuit property' by Dress and Lov\'{a}sz in 1987. We extend these notions to $k$-fold circuits for all natural numbers $k$ and show, in particular that several families of matroids which are known to satisfy the double circuit property, satisfy the $k$-fold circuit property for all natural numbers $k$. These families include all pseudomodular matroids (such as full linear, algebraic and transversal matroids) and certain families of count matroids. These results suggest that the $k$-fold circuit property can be used as a measure of how close the lattice of flats of a matroid is to being a modular lattice.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the study of the minimal excludant in integer partitions by G.E. Andrews and D. Newman, we introduce a pair of new partition statistics, sqrank and rerank. They are related to a polynomial bosonic form of statistical configuration sums for an integrable cellular automaton. For all nonnegative integers $n$, we prove that the partitions of $n$ on which sqrank or rerank takes on a particular value, say $r$, are equinumerous with the partitions of $n$ on which the odd/even minimal exclutant takes on the corresponding value, $2r+1$ or $2r+2$.</description>

      <title>Strongly Regular Graphs with Generalized Denniston and Dual Generalized Denniston Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two families of strongly regular Cayley graphs, or equivalently, partial difference sets, based on elementary abelian groups. The parameters of these two families are generalizations of the Denniston and the dual Denniston parameters, in contrast to the well known Latin square type and negative Latin square type parameters. The two families unify and subsume a number of existing constructions which have been presented in various contexts such as strongly regular graphs, partial difference sets, projective sets, and projective two-weight codes, notably including Denniston's seminal construction concerning maximal arcs in classical projective planes with even order. Our construction generates further momentum in this area, which recently saw exciting progress on the construction of the analogue of the famous Denniston partial difference sets in odd characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2012, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez proved that graphs of bounded degeneracy that have a path of order $n$ also have an induced path of order $\Omega(\log \log n)$. In this paper we give an almost matching upper bound by describing, for arbitrarily large values of $n$, 2-degenerate graphs that have a path of order $n$ and where the longest induced paths have order $O((\log \log n)^{1+o(1)})$.</description>

      <title>A decomposition of graph a-numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $a$-sequence $(a_0(G), a_1(G), \cdots)$ of a finite simple graph $G$, defined recursively through a combinatorial rule and known to coincide with the sequence of rational Betti numbers of the real toric variety associated with $G$.
  In this paper, we establish a combinatorial and topological decomposition formula for the $a$-sequence. As an application, we show that the $a$-sequence is monotone under graph inclusion; that is, $a_i(G) \geq a_i(H)$ for all $i \geq 0$ whenever $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, and obtain the lower and upper bounds of $a_i$-numbers. We also prove that the $a$-sequence is unimodal in $i$ for a broad class of graphs $G$, including those with a Hamiltonian circuit or a universal vertex. These results provide a new class of topological spaces whose Betti number sequences are unimodal but not necessarily log concave, contributing to the study of real loci in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Reconstrucion of oriented matroids from Varchenko-Gelfand algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebra of $R$-valued functions on the set of chambers of a real hyperplane arrangement is called the Varchenko-Gelfand (VG) algebra. This algebra carries a natural filtration by the degree with respect to Heaviside functions, giving rise to the associated graded VG algebra. When the coefficient ring $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic $2$, the graded VG algebra is known to be isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra. In this paper, we study VG algebras over coefficient rings of characteristic different from $2$, and investigate to what extent VG algebras determine the underlying oriented matroid structures.
  Our main results concern hyperplane arrangements that are generic in codimension $2$. For such arrangements, if $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic not equal to $2$, then the oriented matroid can be recovered from both the filtered and the graded VG algebras. As a byproduct, we prove that, unlike the complexification, the cohomology ring of the complement of a $3$-plexification of a real arrangement is not determined by the intersection lattice.
  We also formulate an algorithm that is expected to reconstruct oriented matroids from VG algebras in the case of general arrangements.</description>

      <title>Leaky Zero Forcing on Induced Subgraphs of $d$-dimensional Grid Graphs with an Application to Hopi Rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study zero forcing and $\ell$-leaky zero forcing on induced subgraphs of $d$-dimensional grid graphs. Using $\ell$-leaky forts, we prove structural results showing that for $\ell \le 2d-1$, every nonempty $\ell$-leaky fort in an induced subgraph of $P_{n_1}\square\cdots\square P_{n_d}$ intersects the boundary of the graph. These results give general bounds and, in certain settings, exact values for the $\ell$-leaky forcing number of induced subgraphs. Motivated by this framework, we introduce an integer lattice based definition of the Hopi rectangle graphs $HD(a,b)$ as induced subgraphs of $P_{a+b}\square P_{a+b}$. For this particular family of graphs, we show that the zero forcing number equals the maximum nullity, and we completely characterize the $\ell$-leaky forcing number for all $\ell\ge 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mutual-visibility chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ such that each color class is a mutual-visibility set. In this paper, we prove that determining the mutual-visibility chromatic number of a graph is NP-complete even when restricted to the class of graphs having diameter four and mutual-visibility chromatic number two. We further determine the exact value of the mutual-visibility chromatic number for glued binary trees and glued $t$-ary trees.</description>

      <title>The Littlewood-Richardson rule for Schur multiple zeta functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schur multiple zeta function was defined as a multivariable function by Nakasuji-Phuksuwan-Yamasaki. Inspired by the product formula of Schur functions, the products of Schur multiple zeta functions have been studied. While the product of two Schur functions expands as a linear combination of Schur functions, it is known that a similar expansion for the product of Schur multiple zeta functions can be obtained by symmetrizing, i.e., by taking the summation over all permutations of the variables. In this paper, we present a more refined formula by restricting the summation from the full symmetric group to its specific subgroup.</description>

      <title>Arboreal Ultrametrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultametrics are an important class of distances used in applications such as phylogenetics, clustering and classification theory. Ultrametrics are essentially distances that can be represented by an edge-weighted rooted tree so that all of the distances in the tree from the root to any leaf of the tree are equal. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of ultrametrics called arboreal ultrametrics which have applications in phylogenetics and also arise in the theory of distance-hereditary graphs. These are partial distances, that is distances that are not necessarily defined for every pair of elements in the groundset, that can be represented by an ultrametric arboreal network, that is, an edge-weighted rooted network whose underlying graph is a tree. As with ultrametrics all of the distances in the ultrametric arboreal network from any root to any leaf below it are are equal but, in contrast, the network may have more than one root. In our two main results we characterize when a partial distance is an arboreal ultrametric as well as proving that, somewhat surprisingly, given any unrooted edge-weighted phylogenetic tree there is a necessarily unique way to insert roots into this tree so as to obtain an arboreal ultrametric.</description>

      <title>Basis Number of Graphs Excluding Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basis number of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that the cycle space of $G$ is generated by a family of cycles using each edge at most $k$ times. A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface of bounded genus are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number. Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Boja\'nczyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture. Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$.</description>

      <title>Card guessing after an asymmetric riffle shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a card guessing game with complete feedback. An ordered deck of $n$ cards labeled $1$ up to $n$ is riffle-shuffled exactly one time. Given a value $p\in(0{,}1)\setminus\{\frac12\}$, the riffle shuffle is assumed to be unbalanced, such that the cut is expected to happen at position $p\cdot n$. The goal of the game is to maximize the number of correct guesses of the cards: one after another a single card is drawn from the top, and shown to the guesser until no cards remain. We provide a detailed analysis of the optimal guessing strategy and study the distribution of the number of correct guesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The length $\mathsf{is}(\pi)$ of a longest increasing subsequence in a permutation $\pi$ has been extensively studied. An increasing subsequence is one that has no descents. We study generalizations of this statistic by finding longest subsequences with other descent restrictions. We first consider the statistic which encodes the longest length of a subsequence with a given number of descents. We then generalize this to restrict the descent set of the subsequence. Extending the classical result for $\mathsf{is}(\pi)$, we show how these statistics can be obtained using the RSK correspondence and the Sch\"utzenberger involution. In particular, these statistics only depend on the recording tableau of the permutation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give recurrences, generating functions and explicit exact expressions for the enumeration of fundamental quantities involving runs in binary strings. We first focus on enumerations concerning runs of ones, and we then analyse the same enumerations when runs of ones and runs of zeros are jointly considered. We give the connections between these two types of run enumeration, and with the problem of compositions. We also analyse the same enumerations with a Hamming weight constraint. We discuss which of the many number sequences that emerge from these problems are already known and listed in the OEIS. Additionally, we extend our main enumerative results to the probabilistic scenario in which binary strings are outcomes of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hons, Klimo\v{s}ov\'a, Kucheriya, Mik\v{s}an\'ik, Tkadlec, and Tyomkyn proved that, for every integer $\ell \ge 1$, every directed graph with minimum out-degree at least $3.23 \cdot \ell$ contains a $(2,\ell)$-spider (a $1$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves) as a subgraph. They also conjectured that the bound on the minimum out-degree can be further improved to $2 \ell$. In this note, we confirm their conjecture by showing that every directed graph with minimum out-degree at least $2\ell$ contains a $(2, \ell)$-spider as a subgraph. This result is best possible, as the complete directed graph with $2\ell$ vertices does not contain a $(2,\ell)$-spider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces new structural decompositions for almost symmetric numerical semigroups through the combinatorial lens of Young diagrams. To do that, we use the foundational correspondence between numerical sets and Young diagrams, which enables a visual and algorithmic approach to studying properties of numerical semigroups. Central to the paper, a decomposition theorem for almost symmetric numerical semigroups is proved, which reveals that such semigroups can be uniquely expressed as a combination of a numerical semigroup, its dual and an ordinary numerical semigroup.</description>
