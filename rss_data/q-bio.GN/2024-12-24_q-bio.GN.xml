      <title>Deep Learning in Proteomics Informatics: Applications, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is an advanced technology that relies on large-scale data and complex models for feature extraction and pattern recognition. It has been widely applied across various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated significant potential in the realm of proteomics informatics, particularly in deciphering complex biological information. The introduction of this technology not only accelerates the processing speed of protein data but also enhances the accuracy of predictions regarding protein structure and function. This provides robust support for both fundamental biology research and applied biotechnological studies. Currently, deep learning is primarily focused on applications such as protein sequence analysis, three-dimensional structure prediction, functional annotation, and the construction of protein interaction networks. These applications offer numerous advantages to proteomic research. Despite its growing prevalence in this field, deep learning faces several challenges including data scarcity, insufficient model interpretability, and computational complexity; these factors hinder its further advancement within proteomics. This paper comprehensively reviews the applications of deep learning in proteomics along with the challenges it encounters. The aim is to provide a systematic theoretical discussion and practical basis for research in this domain to facilitate ongoing development and innovation of deep learning technologies within proteomics.</description>

      <title>A CNN Approach to Polygenic Risk Prediction of Kidney Stone Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kidney stones are a common and debilitating health issue, and genetic factors play a crucial role in determining susceptibility. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to kidney stone risk, translating these findings into effective clinical tools remains a challenge. In this study, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to enhance Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) models for predicting kidney stone susceptibility. Using a curated dataset of kidney stone-associated SNPs from a recent GWAS, we apply CNNs to model non-linear genetic interactions and improve prediction accuracy. Our approach includes SNP selection, genotype filtering, and model training using a dataset of 560 individuals, divided into training and testing subsets. We compare our CNN-based model with traditional machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines, demonstrating that the CNN outperforms these models in terms of classification accuracy and ROC-AUC. The proposed model achieved a validation accuracy of 62%, with an ROC-AUC of 0.68, suggesting its potential for improving genetic-based risk prediction for kidney stones. This study contributes to the growing field of genomics-driven precision medicine and highlights the promise of deep learning in enhancing PRS models for complex diseases.</description>

      <title>Safe Paths and Sequences for Scalable ILPs in RNA Transcript Assembly Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common step at the core of many RNA transcript assembly tools is to find a set of weighted paths that best explain the weights of a DAG. While such problems easily become NP-hard, scalable solvers exist only for a basic error-free version of this problem, namely minimally decomposing a network flow into weighted paths.
  The main result of this paper is to show that we can achieve speedups of two orders of magnitude also for path-finding problems in the realistic setting (i.e., the weights do not induce a flow). We obtain these by employing the safety information that is encoded in the graph structure inside Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solvers for these problems. We first characterize the paths that appear in all path covers of the DAG, generalizing a graph reduction commonly used in the error-free setting (e.g. by Kloster et al. [ALENEX~2018]). Secondly, following the work of Ma, Zheng and Kingsford [RECOMB 2021], we characterize the \emph{sequences} of arcs that appear in all path covers of the DAG.
  We experiment with a path-finding ILP model (least squares) and with a more recent and accurate one. We use a variety of datasets originally created by Shao and Kingsford [TCBB, 2017], as well as graphs built from sequencing reads by the state-of-the-art tool for long-read transcript discovery, IsoQuant [Prjibelski et al., Nat.~Biotechnology~2023]. The ILPs armed with safe paths or sequences exhibit significant speed-ups over the original ones. On graphs with a large width, average speed-ups are in the range $50-160\times$ in the latter ILP model and in the range $100-1000\times$ in the least squares model.
  Our scaling techniques apply to any ILP whose solution paths are a path cover of the arcs of the DAG. As such, they can become a scalable building block of practical RNA transcript assembly tools, avoiding heuristic trade-offs currently needed on complex graphs.</description>

      <title>A robust, scalable K-statistic for quantifying immune cell clustering in spatial proteomics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial summary statistics based on point process theory are widely used to quantify the spatial organization of cell populations in single-cell spatial proteomics data. Among these, Ripley's $K$ is a popular metric for assessing whether cells are spatially clustered or are randomly dispersed. However, the key assumption of spatial homogeneity is frequently violated in spatial proteomics data, leading to overestimates of cell clustering and colocalization. To address this, we propose a novel $K$-based method, termed \textit{KAMP} (\textbf{K} adjustment by \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}oments of the \textbf{P}ermutation distribution), for quantifying the spatial organization of cells in spatial proteomics samples. \textit{KAMP} leverages background cells in each sample along with a new closed-form representation of the first and second moments of the permutation distribution of Ripley's $K$ to estimate an empirical null model. Our method is robust to inhomogeneity, computationally efficient even in large datasets, and provides approximate $p$-values for testing spatial clustering and colocalization. Methodological developments are motivated by a spatial proteomics study of 103 women with ovarian cancer, where our analysis using \textit{KAMP} shows a positive association between immune cell clustering and overall patient survival. Notably, we also find evidence that using $K$ without correcting for sample inhomogeneity may bias hazard ratio estimates in downstream analyses. \textit{KAMP} completes this analysis in just 5 minutes, compared to 538 minutes for the only competing method that adequately addresses inhomogeneity.</description>
