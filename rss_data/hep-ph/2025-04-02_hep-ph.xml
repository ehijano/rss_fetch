      <title>Neutrino Theory in the Precision Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document summarises discussions on future directions in theoretical neutrino physics, which are the outcome of a neutrino theory workshop held at CERN in February 2025. The starting point is the realisation that neutrino physics offers unique opportunities to address some of the most fundamental questions in physics. This motivates a vigorous experimental programme which the theory community fully supports. \textbf{A strong effort in theoretical neutrino physics is paramount to optimally take advantage of upcoming neutrino experiments and to explore the synergies with other areas of particle, astroparticle, and nuclear physics, as well as cosmology.} Progress on the theory side has the potential to significantly boost the physics reach of experiments, as well as go well beyond their original scope. Strong collaboration between theory and experiment is essential in the precision era. To foster such collaboration, \textbf{we propose to establish a CERN Neutrino Physics Centre.} Taking inspiration from the highly successful LHC Physics Center at Fermilab, the CERN Neutrino Physics Centre would be the European hub of the neutrino community, covering experimental and theoretical activities.</description>

      <title>Transverse Energy--Energy Correlators at Small $x$ for Photon--Hadron Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transverse energy--energy correlator (TEEC) observable in photon--hadron and photon--jet production in p+p and p+A collisions at small $x$. We derive the relevant expressions in the high-energy limit of the scattering where the dipole picture is applicable and show how the dependence on the fragmentation function of the hadron cancels due to the momentum-sum rule. The nonperturbative scattering with the target nucleus is expressed in terms of the dipole amplitude, which also describes nonlinear gluon saturation effects. The TEEC observable is computed in the RHIC and LHC kinematics, and we show that it can be sensitive to the dipole amplitude, making it a potentially good observable for studying saturation effects.</description>

      <title>Naturally Resonant Dark Matter from Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the mass resonance structure that naturally arises from extra-dimensional models. The resonance can enhance the dark matter annihilation as well as self-interaction. We demonstrate such a resonance structure by considering the fermionic dark matter and dark photon models on an $S^1/(Z_2 \times Z_2')$ orbifold. We also note that this model embeds dark matter axial vector coupling to the dark photon, which opens up the viable dark matter parameter space. We then present the unique predictions for direct-detection experiments and accelerator searches.</description>

      <title>Discovery Prospects for a Minimal Dark Matter Model at Cosmic and Intensity Frontier Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the detection prospects for a minimal secluded dark matter model, where a fermionic dark matter particle interacts with the Standard Model (SM) via a kinetically mixed dark photon. We focus on scenarios where the dark photon decays visibly, making it a prime target for beam-dump experiments. In this model, the dark matter relic abundance can be achieved by a variety of mechanisms: freeze-in, out-of-equilibrium freeze-out, and secluded freeze-out. We demonstrate that the secluded freeze-out regime in the considered mass range is now entirely excluded by a combination of direct and indirect detection constraints. Moreover, we show that future direct detection and intensity frontier experiments offer complementary sensitivity to this minimal model in the parameter space where the hidden sector never enters equilibrium with the SM. In out-of-equilibrium freeze-out scenarios, nuclear-recoil direct detection experiments can still access signals above the neutrino fog that are mediated by dark photons that are too weakly coupled to be detected in future beam dump experiments. Meanwhile, future beam dump experiments provide a powerful probe of the freeze-in parameter space in this model, which is largely inaccessible to direct detection experiments. Notably, even in the absence of a future observation in direct detection experiments, a dark photon discovery remains possible at SHiP, DUNE, LHCb, and DarkQuest within this minimal dark matter model.</description>

      <title>The International Axion Observatory (IAXO): case, status and plans. Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Axion Observatory (IAXO) is a next-generation axion helioscope designed to search for solar axions with unprecedented sensitivity. IAXO holds a unique position in the global landscape of axion searches, as it will probe a region of the axion parameter space inaccessible to any other experiment. In particular, it will explore QCD axion models in the mass range from meV to eV, covering scenarios motivated by astrophysical observations and potentially extending to axion dark matter models. Several studies in recent years have demonstrated that IAXO has the potential to probe a wide range of new physics beyond solar axions, including dark photons, chameleons, gravitational waves, and axions from nearby supernovae. IAXO will build upon the two-decade experience gained with CAST, the detailed studies for BabyIAXO, which is currently under construction, as well as new technologies. If, in contrast to expectations, solar axion searches with IAXO ``only'' result in limits on new physics in presently uncharted parameter territory, these exclusions would be very robust and provide significant constraints on models, as they would not depend on untestable cosmological assumptions.</description>

      <title>Importance of Loop Effects in Probing Lepton Number Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the lepton number violation would be a smoking gun signal for physics beyond the Standard Model, and its most sensitive probe is the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$). Working in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we show that one-loop effects can remarkably improve the tree-level bounds on the new-physics scales for several dimension-7 operators across different flavours. Using ultraviolet model examples, we then showcase the competition among $0\nu\beta\beta$ contributions induced by dimension-7 and loop-level dimension-5 SMEFT operators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information meets High-Energy Physics: Input to the update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown, and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding, by about 12 orders of magnitude, the laboratory setups typically used in the field. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research, and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Flavored Peccei-Quinn symmetries in the minimal $\nu$DFSZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axion model extended with two right-handed neutrino fields to realize the minimal type-I seesaw. In this $\nu$DFSZ scheme we systematically determine the simplest quark and lepton flavor patterns compatible with masses, mixing and charge-parity violation data, realized by flavored U(1) Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetries. We discuss axion dark matter production in pre and post-inflationary cosmology in this context, and predictions for the axion couplings to photons and fermions. In particular, helioscopes and haloscopes are able to probe our models via their distinct axion-to-photon couplings, while in the quark sector the most stringent constraints on axion-fermion couplings are set by $K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ + a$. Flavor-violating constraints in the lepton sector are not as relevant as those stemming from star cooling that restrict the diagonal $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ axion couplings to charged leptons. We also obtain axion mass bounds for the most interesting models and discuss how minimal flavored PQ symmetries provide a natural framework to suppress flavor-violating couplings.</description>

      <title>Atoms as Electron Accelerators for New Physics Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, atomic electrons localized around the nucleus exhibit a characteristic momentum distribution that, in elements with high atomic number, remains significant up to relativistic values. Consequently, in fixed-target experiments, atoms can effectively act as electron accelerators, increasing the centre-of-mass energy in collisions with beam particles. In this work, we leverage this effect to explore its potential for new physics searches. We consider positrons from beams of various energies annihilating with atomic electrons in a $^{74}$W fixed target. We compute the production rates of new vector bosons and pseudoscalar particles as functions of their couplings and masses. We show that the electron-at-rest approximation significantly underestimates the mass reach for producing these new states compared to the results obtained by properly accounting for atomic electron momenta. In particular, we estimate the sensitivity for detecting these new particles using the positron beam at the Beam Test Facility linac at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, the H4 beamline in the CERN North Area, and the proposed Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility of Jefferson Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Open quantum system approach to inclusive jet production in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a factorization formula for inclusive jet production in heavy-ion collisions using the tools of Effective Field Theory (EFT). We show how physics at widely separated scales in this process can be systematically separated by matching to EFTs at successively lower virtualities. Owing to a strong scale separation, we recover a vacuum-like DGLAP evolution above the jet scale, while the additional low-energy scales induced by the medium effectively probe the internal structure of the jet. As a result, the cross section can be written as a series with an increasing number of subjets characterized by perturbative matching coefficients each of which is convolved with a {\it distinct} function. These functions encode broadening, medium-induced radiations as well as quantum interference such as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect and color coherence dynamics to all orders in perturbation theory. As a first application of this EFT framework, we investigate the case of an unresolved jet and show how the cross section can be factorized and fully separate the jet dynamics from the universal physics of the medium. To compare to the existing literature, we explicitly compute the medium jet function at next-to-leading order in the coupling and leading order in medium opacity.</description>

      <title>Axion forces in axion backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of (approximate) shift symmetry. Because of the pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force mediated by the axion at the tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to observable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. At the one-loop level, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent force. This force is coherently enhanced when there exists an axion background. In this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion background. We find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a crucial role in determining this force. The background-induced axion force $V_{\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. The shift symmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or effectively by the axion background. When the shift symmetry is broken, $V_{\rm bkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation number of the background axions. We investigate possible probes on this using fifth-force search and atomic spectroscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the B-L gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during B-L symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

      <title>Mapping between $\gamma_5$ schemes in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relation between two distinct prescriptions for $\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularization -- the Breitenlohner Maison t'Hooft Veltman (BMHV) scheme and Naive Dimensional Regularisation (NDR). The BMHV scheme is the only algebraically consistent scheme, but necessitates chiral symmetry restoring counterterms and it is computationally more expensive, limiting its practical use. We show how the quantum effective action can be translated between both schemes and present these translation rules for the Wilson Coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), that can easily be implemented into automated tools for SMEFT computations. Finally, we examine how this scheme dependence manifests itself in matching calculations, identifying the cases in which the dependence cancels in the final result. To examplify this, we consider a concrete UV scenario matched onto the SMEFT at one-loop order in both schemes. Our work aims to facilitate more accurate SMEFT computations and can be considered as a first step towards a comprehensive map between the two continuation schemes.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo phase space integration of multiparticle cross sections with carlomat_4.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional phase space integrals must be calculated in order to obtain predictions for total or differential cross sections, or to simulate unweighted events of multiparticle reactions. The corresponding matrix elements, already in the leading order, receive contributions typically from dozens of thousands of the Feynman diagrams, many of which often involve strong peaks due to denominators of some Feynman propagators approaching their minima. As the number of peaks exceeds by far the number of integration variables, such integrals can practically be performed within the multichannel Monte Carlo approach, with different phase space parameterizations, each designed to smooth possibly a few peaks at a time. This obviously requires a lot different phase space parameterizations which, if possible, should be generated and combined in a single multichannel Monte Carlo procedure in a fully automatic way.A few different approaches to the calculation of the multidimensional phase space integrals have been incorporated in version 4.5 of the multipurpose Monte Carlo program carlomat. The present work illustrates how carlomat_4.5 can facilitate the challenging task of calculating the multidimensional phase space integrals.</description>

      <title>Branching fractions and CP asymmetries in charm meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a consistent way to include $\eta$-$\eta^\prime$ mixing in global analyses of two-body decays of heavy hadrons employing the approximate flavour-SU(3) symmetry of QCD. The framework is applied to $D\to P \eta^\prime$ decays, where $P$ denotes a pseudoscalar meson. The result shows that flavour-SU(3) symmetry holds in the decay rates of these modes to better than 30%. With future data we expect the branching ratios of $D_s\to K^+ \eta^\prime$ and $D \to K^+\eta^\prime$ to move upward and downward by $\sim\!\! 1\sigma$, respectively. Subsequently I discuss the implications of the LHCb measurements of the CP asymmetries in $D\to K^+K^-$ and $D\to \pi^+\pi^-$ for generic scenarios of new physics. New-physics contributions should have imprints on other CP asymmetries as well and can be tested through sum rules. Promising decays are $D_s^+\to K^0\pi^+$, $D^+\to \bar K^0K^+$, $D^0\to K^0 \bar K^{*0}$, $D^0\to \bar K^0 K^{*0}$, $D_s^+\to K^{*0}\pi^+$, and $D^+\to \bar K^{*0}K^+$.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study general properties of confinement phase transitions in the early universe. An observable gravitational wave signal from such transitions requires significant supercooling. However, in almost all understood examples of confining gauge theories the degree of supercooling is too small to give interesting gravitational wave signals. We review and highlight the evidence why supercooling is not generic in confining gauge theories. The exceptions are Randall-Sundrum models which define a strongly coupled gauge theory holographically by a 5D gravitational theory. We construct a simple illustrative model of a 4D gauge theory inspired by features of the Randall-Sundrum model. It is a large-$N$ gauge theory in the conformal window coupled to a weakly coupled scalar field which undergoes a supercooled phase transition that breaks the conformal symmetry and triggers confinement. We show that there are interesting features in the gravitational wave spectra that can carry the imprint of the confining gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Reinterpretation and preservation of data and analyses in HEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from particle physics experiments are unique and are often the result of a very large investment of resources. Given the potential scientific impact of these data, which goes far beyond the immediate priorities of the experimental collaborations that obtain them, it is imperative that the collaborations and the wider particle physics community publish and preserve sufficient information to ensure that this impact can be realised, now and into the future. The information to be published and preserved includes the algorithms, statistical information, simulations and the recorded data. This publication and preservation requires significant resources, and should be a strategic priority with commensurate planning and resource allocation from the earliest stages of future facilities and experiments.</description>

      <title>$^3$H and $^3$He nuclei production in a combined thermal and coalescence framework for heavy-ion collisions in the few-GeV energy regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermal model describing hadron production in heavy-ion collisions in the few-GeV energy regime is combined with the idea of nucleon coalescence to make predictions for the $^3$H and $^3$He nuclei production. A realistic parametrization of the freeze-out conditions is used, which reproduces well the spectra of protons and pions. It also correctly predicts the deuteron yield that agrees with the experimental value. The predicted yields of $^3$H and $^3$He appear to be smaller by about a factor of two compared to the experimental results. The model predictions for the spectra can be compared with future experimental data.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric absorption of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, the interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter is assumed to be very small. Nevertheless, in this article, I show that the effective resonant absorption of dark photon dark matter in the atmosphere is definitely possible. This might also be associated with the alleged temperature anomalies observed in our upper stratosphere. By allowing a small amount of additional energy deposition to our upper stratosphere, a narrow dark matter mass range $m_A \sim 0.0001-0.001$ eV and the corresponding range of the mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ are constrained for the first time. This proposal might overturn our usual assumption of extremely weak interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter and revive the hope of detecting dark matter directly. Some important implications of this proposal such as the heating of planets and supermassive dark stars would also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Almost general analysis of $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry perturbed by charged leptons and its testability by DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we generally analyze the $\mu - \tau$ reflection symmetry modified by small mixings of charged leptons and interpret deviations of the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ and the Dirac CP phase $\delta$. As an approximaition, the left-handed diagonalization $U_{e}$ of charged leptons is assumed to have a similar magnitude as the CKM matrix. In other words, the 1-3 mixing is neglected and the 1-2 and 2-3 mixing are to be about $O(0.1)$. The Dirac CP phase $\delta$ of the MNS matrix is evaluated in such parameter regions. As a result, since deviations from the predictions $\sin \theta_{23} = \pi/4, \delta = \pm \pi/2$ has information on the charged lepton sector, the observation of $\delta$ gives an indication of the dominant contribution depending on a magnitude of the deviation. On the other hand, if $\d$ is not observed, such a scenario is excluded by about 5 years of observation of next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Resonant ALP-Portal Dark Matter Annihilation as a Solution to the $B^{\pm} \to K^{\pm} \nu \bar{\nu}$ Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle II collaboration recently reported a $2.7\sigma$ excess in the rare decay $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$, potentially signaling new physics. We propose an axion-like particle (ALP)-portal dark matter (DM) framework to explain this anomaly while satisfying the observed DM relic abundance. By invoking a resonant annihilation mechanism ($m_a \sim 2m_\chi$), we demonstrate that the ALP-mediated interactions between the Standard Model and DM sectors simultaneously account for the $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$ anomaly and thermal freeze-out dynamics. Two distinct scenarios-long-lived ALPs decaying outside detectors (displaced diphotons) and ALPs decaying invisibly to DM pairs (missing energy)-are examined. While the displaced diphotons scenario is excluded by kaon decay bounds ($K^\pm \to \pi^\pm + \text{inv.}$), the invisible decay channel remains unconstrained and aligns with Belle II's missing energy signature. Using the coupled Boltzmann equation formalism, we rigorously incorporate early kinetic decoupling effects, revealing deviations up to a factor of 20 from traditional relic density predictions in resonance regions. For the missing energy scenario, the viable parameter space features ALP-SM and ALP-DM couplings: $g_{aWW} \in (7.3 \times 10^{-5} - 1.1 \times 10^{-4})\, \text{GeV}^{-1}$ (from $B^\pm \to K^\pm a$) and $g_{a\chi\chi} \in (6.1\times10^{-5} - 6.0\times 10^{-3})\, \text{GeV}^{-1}$ (for resonant annihilation), accommodating ALP masses $m_a \in (0.6, 4.8)\, \text{GeV}$. Therefore, this work establishes the ALP portal as a viable bridge between the $B^\pm \to K^\pm \nu \bar{\nu}$ anomaly and thermal DM production, emphasizing precision calculations of thermal decoupling in resonance regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalized transverse momentum dependent distribution (GTMD) $E_{21}$ for proton using light-front quark-diquark model. We construct the expression of $E_{21}$ GTMD using the overlap equation in light-front wave functions obtained from the GTMD correlator with Dirac matrix structure $\Gamma=1$, in both situations of scalar and vector diquark. The $3$-dimensional plots of GTMD $E_{21}$ have been analyzed with respect to its variables by taking two variables at a time while holding others constant.</description>

      <title>Tensor Meson Pole contributions to the HLbL piece of $a_{\mu}^{\rm{HLbL}}$ within R$\chi$T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our results for the tensor meson pole contributions to the Hadronic Light-by-Light piece of $a_\mu$, using Resonance Chiral Theory in the purely hadronic region. Given the differences between the dispersive and holographic results for it and the resulting discussion of the corresponding uncertainty estimate for the Hadronic Light-by-Light section of the $g\, -\, 2$ theory initiative second White Paper, we consider timely to present an alternative evaluation. In our approach, in addition to the lightest tensor meson nonet, two vector meson resonance nonets are considered. We work in the chiral limit, where all parameters are determined by imposing short-distance QCD constraints, and the radiative tensor decay widths. Within this setting, only the form factor $F_1^T$ is non-vanishing, in agreement with the result put forward by the dispersive study. We obtain the following results for the different contributions (in units of $10^{-11}$): $a_\mu^{\rm a_2-pole}=-1.09(10)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.00}_{-0.11})_{\rm syst}$, $a_\mu^{\rm f_2-pole}=-3.4(3)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.4}_{-0.0})_{\rm syst}$ and $a_\mu^{\rm f_2^\prime-pole}=-0.046(14)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.008}_{-0.000})_{\rm syst}$, which add up to $a_\mu^{\rm (a_2+f_2+f_2^\prime)-pole}=-4.5^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$.</description>

      <title>General relativistic effects on photon spectrum emitted from dark matter halos around primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate general relativistic effects on the photon spectrum emitted from decaying (or annihilating) particle dark matter in the halo surrounding a primordial black hole. The spectrum undergoes significant modification due to gravitational redshifts, which induces broadening as a result of the intense gravitational field near the black hole. This characteristic alteration in the photon spectrum presents a unique observational signature. Future observations of such spectral features may provide critical evidence for a mixed dark matter scenario, involving both primordial black holes and particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Single spin asymmetry among hyperons using scalar diquark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier transformed chiral even generalized parton distributions $(GPDs)$ for purely transverse momentum transfer $(\Delta^+=0)$ characterize an individual parton distribution of a hyperon in a perpendicular plane at some distance from the center of momentum of the system. Further, the presence of left-right asymmetry in the distorted parton distribution gives a clue for the presence of single-spin asymmetry. In order to have a deep insight into the distortions, we have exhibited the information about asymmetries from the spin flip matrix element of a $GPD$ for hyperons by employing scalar diquark model and also compared parton distributions of different possible combinations of quark-diquark pair to get substantial structural information on hyperons.</description>

      <title>The electron EDM in the decoupling limit of the aligned 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss model-independent contributions to the electron EDM, focusing on those contributions emerging from a heavy scalar sector linearly realized. To provide a concrete new physics realization, we investigate the aligned 2HDM in the decoupling limit. We point out that logarithmically enhanced contributions generated from Barr-Zee diagrams with a fermion loop are present in the aligned 2HDM, an effect encoded in the decoupling limit by effective dimension-6 operators, through the mixing of four-fermion into dipole operators. The same large logarithms are absent in specific 2HDMs where a $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry is enforced, which thus controls the basis of effective operators relevant for calculating new physics contributions to EDMs. In other words, the $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry acts as a suppression mechanism. In the aligned 2HDM these contributions are proportional to sources of CP violation that are potentially large, and absent in presence of the $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry. We then investigate the impact on the electron EDM of this extended set of free parameters.</description>

      <title>Lepton-proton two-photon exchange with improved soft-photon approximation including proton's structure effects in HB$\chi$PT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved evaluation of the two-photon exchange correction to the unpolarized lepton-proton elastic scattering process at very low-energies relevant to the MUSE experiment, where only the dominant intermediate elastic proton is considered. We employ the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and invoke the soft-photon approximation in order to reduce the intricate 4-point loop-integrals into simpler 3-point loop-integrals. In the present work, we adopt a more robust methodology compared to an earlier work along the same lines for analytically evaluating the loop-integrations, and incorporate important corrections at next-to-next-to-leading order. These include the proton's structure effects which renormalize the proton-photon interaction vertices and the proton's propagator. Finally, our results allow a model-independent estimation of the charge asymmetry for the scattering of unpolarized massive leptons and anti-leptons.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD coupled axion dark matter with the MICROSCOPE space experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion dark matter coupled via QCD induces a non-zero differential acceleration between test masses of different composition. Tests of the equivalence principle, like the recent MICROSCOPE space mission, are sensitive to such a signal. We use the final released data of the MICROSCOPE experiment, to search for this effect. We find no positive signal consistent with the dark matter model, and set upper limits on the axion-gluon coupling that improve existing laboratory bounds by up to two orders of magnitude for axion masses in the $10^{-17}$ eV to $10^{-13}$ eV range.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin polarization as a novel probe of medium-induced transverse-momentum-broadening effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons within unpolarized jets originates from the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) fragmentation function $D_{1T}^\perp (z, p_T, \mu^2)$. In the vacuum environment, the QCD evolution of this TMD fragmentation function is governed by the Collins-Soper equation. However, in the presence of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium, the jet-medium interaction induces a transverse-momentum-broadening effect that modifies the QCD evolution. As a result, the transverse spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions differs from that in $pp$ collisions. We demonstrate that this difference serves as a sensitive probe for studying jet-medium interaction, offering a novel perspective through the spin degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Renormalization Group Equations in the $\nu$SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate two-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) with right-handed neutrinos, i.e., the so-called $\nu$SMEFT, up to dimension five. Besides the two-loop RGEs of dimension-five (dim-5) operators, we also present those of the renormalizable couplings, including contributions from dim-5 operators. We check consistency relations among the first and second poles of $\varepsilon \equiv (4-d)/2$ with $d$ being the space-time dimension for all renormalization constants and find that those for lepton doublet and right-handed neutrino wave-function renormalization constants, as well as for renormalization constants of charged-lepton and neutrino Yukawa coupling matrices, do not hold. This leads to divergent RG functions for these fields and Yuwawa coupling matrices. We figure out that such infinite RG functions arise from the non-invariance of fields and Yukawa coupling matrices under field redefinitions, considering that flavor transformations are a kind of linear field redefinitions. Those infinite RG functions will disappear once one restores contributions from the derivative of renormalization constants with respect to the Wilson coefficients of redundant operators or, alternatively, considers the RGEs of flavor invariants, which are physical quantities and remain invariant under field redefinitions.</description>

      <title>Topological Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we shall consider the effects of a non-trivial topology on the effective potential of the Standard Model. Specifically we shall assume that the spacetime topology is $S^1\times R^3$ and we shall calculate the Standard Model effective potential for such a topological spacetime. As we demonstrate, for small values of the compact dimension radius, the electroweak symmetry is unbroken, but for a critical length and beyond, the electroweak symmetry is broken, since the configuration space of the Higgs field contains an additional energetically favorable minimum, compared to the minimum at the origin. The two minima are separated by a barrier, thus a phase transition can occur, via quantum tunnelling, which mimics a first order phase transition. This is a non-thermal phase transition, similar possibly to quantum Hall topological phase transitions, hence in the context of this scenario, the electroweak symmetry breaking does not require a high temperature to occur. The present scenario does not rely on the occurrence of the inflationary era, only on the expansion of the Universe, however we briefly discuss the freezing of the superhorizon terms in $S^1\times R^3$ spacetime, if inflation occurred. We also investigate the large scale differences of the gravitational potential due to the non-trivial topology. Finally, we briefly mention the distinct inequivalent topological field configurations that can exist due to the non-trivial topology, which are classified by the first Stieffel class which in the case at hand is $H^{1}(S^{1}{\times R}^{3},Z_{\widetilde{2}})=Z_2$, so even and odd elements can exist. We also briefly qualitatively discuss how a topologically induced electroweak phase transition can yield primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-model approach to flavor models: A case study for $S_4^\prime$ modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method of searching for parameters with experimental constraints in generic flavor models by utilizing diffusion models, which are classified as a type of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). As a specific example, we consider the $S_4^\prime$ modular flavor model and construct a neural network that reproduces quark masses, the CKM matrix, and the Jarlskog invariant by treating free parameters in the flavor model as generating targets. By generating new parameters with the trained network, we find various phenomenologically interesting parameter regions where an analytical evaluation of the $S_4^\prime$ model is challenging. Additionally, we confirm that the spontaneous CP violation occurs in the $S_4^\prime$ model. The diffusion model enables an inverse problem approach, allowing the machine to provide a series of plausible model parameters from given experimental data. Moreover, it can serve as a versatile analytical tool for extracting new physical predictions from flavor models.</description>

      <title>Model-independent unbinned analysis of $B \to K^*(\to K^+\pi^-)\mu^+\mu^-$: zeroes, bounds, Wilson coefficients and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model-independent method to study the four-body decay $B\to K^*(\to K^+\pi^-)\mu^+\mu^-$, based on extracting continuous observables with a moments approach. The method allows the observables to be determined unbinned in both the dilepton and $K^+\pi^-$ invariant masses on which the decay dynamics depend. This will allow the method to shed new light on how the observables depend on the P- and S-wave contributions to the $K^+\pi^-$ system. This approach contrasts with the state-of-the-art analyses, which bin in dilepton and $K^+\pi^-$ mass, or use a model for the dependence of the underlying decay amplitudes on these masses. The method does not require making a statistical fit, and so avoids problems of biases and poor uncertainty estimation when dealing with small samples or a large number of fit parameters. We provide the Standard Model predictions for the unbinned optimised observables, derive new geometrical bounds on their values and study the robustness of these bounds in the presence of a scalar new physics contribution. We explore the zero-crossing points of $P_2$ and $P_{4,5}^\prime$ observables as a function of a new physics contribution to the dominant vector Wilson coefficient, $C_9^{\rm NP}$. We also discuss the conditions that can be used to test the theoretical model of the amplitudes needed for an experimental amplitude analysis. Finally, as an illustration, we show how the proposed method might be used to extract the zero-crossing points, make a comparison with the bounds and test a non-trivial relation between the observable values.</description>

      <title>Massive Black Holes Seeded by Dark Matter -- Implications for Little Red Dots and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts challenge standard seeding scenarios. We examine a dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) model in which gravothermal collapse leads to the formation of massive BH seeds ab initio. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to predict properties of the dSIDM-seeded SMBH population. Billion solar mass quasars are reproduced along with low-mass faint active galactic nuclei (known as little red dots) with SMBH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratios consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. To match the abundance of the observed bright quasars, a percent-level duty-cycle is suggested, implying a large population of dormant SMBHs. The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM-driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.</description>

Abstract: By consideration of the Compact object HESS J1731-347 as a hybrid twin compact star, i.e., a more compact star than its hadronic twin of the same mass, its stellar properties are derived. Besides showing that the properties of compact stars in this work are in good agreement with state-of-the-art constraints both from measurements carried out in laboratory experiments as well as by multi-messenger astronomy observations, the realization of an early strong hadron-quark first order phase transition as implied by the twins is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Short-Baseline Near Detector at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SBND is a 112 ton liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector located 110 meters from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) target at Fermilab. Its main goals include searches for eV-scale sterile neutrinos as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program, other searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, and precision studies of neutrino-argon interactions. In addition, SBND is providing a platform for LArTPC neutrino detector technology development and is an excellent training ground for the international group of scientists and engineers working towards the upcoming flagship Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). SBND began operation in July 2024, and started collecting stable neutrino beam data in December 2024 with an unprecedented rate of ~7,000 neutrino events per day. During its currently approved operation plans (2024-2027), SBND is expected to accumulate nearly 10 million neutrino interactions. The near detector dataset will be instrumental in testing the sterile neutrino hypothesis with unprecedented sensitivity in SBN and in probing signals of beyond the Standard Model physics. It will also be used to significantly advance our understanding of the physics of neutrino-argon interactions ahead of DUNE. After the planned accelerator restart at Fermilab (2029+), opportunities are being explored to operate SBND in antineutrino mode in order to address the scarcity of antineutrino-argon scattering data, or in a dedicated beam-dump mode to significantly enhance sensitivity to searches for new physics. SBND is an international effort, with approximately 40% of institutions from Europe, contributing to detector construction, commissioning, software development, and data analysis. Continued European involvement and leadership are essential during SBND's operations and analysis phase for both the success of SBND, SBN and its role leading up to DUNE.</description>

      <title>Transition magnetic moments for $\Delta \rightarrow p$ transition in asymmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we calculate the transition magnetic moments for the radiative decays of $\Delta$ baryon to proton $(\Delta \rightarrow p)$ in isospin asymmetric nuclear medium at finite temperature using chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. Within the framework of chiral SU(3) mean field model, the properties of baryons in asymmetric medium are modified through the exchange of scalar fields $(\sigma, \zeta, \delta)$ and vector fields $(\omega, \rho)$. The isospin asymmetry of medium is taken into account via scalar-isovector field $\delta$ and vector iso-vector field $\rho$. We calculate the in-medium masses of quarks, proton and $\Delta$ baryon in asymmetric matter within the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model and use these as input in the chiral constituent quark ($\chi$CQM) model to calculate the in-medium transition magnetic moments for $(\Delta \rightarrow p)$ transition for different values of isospin asymmetry of hot and dense medium. For calculating the magnetic moments of baryons, contributions of valence quarks, quark sea and orbital angular momentum of quark sea are considered in these calculations.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the liquid-gas transition of nuclear matter can be rigorously described with the quantum chromodynamics by combining the quark gap equation and the Faddeev equation of nucleon. Our investigation focuses on this transition at zero temperature and finite chemical potential, revealing a finite difference between the gas and liquid solution of the quark propagator. This difference emerges from the shift of the nucleon pole mass in medium, which is generated in the nucleon channel of the quark gap equation. We prove that such a difference is precisely the contour contribution from the shift of the nucleon pole. The resulting discontinuity manifests as a first-order phase transition and fundamentally determines both the nuclear binding energy and the saturation density. We then derive an analytical relation between the binding energy and the sigma term of the nucleon, yielding a binding energy of $E/A=15.9\,\textrm{MeV}$. Furthermore, by establishing the relation between the nuclear saturation density and the vector charge of nucleon in association with the binding energy, we determine the saturation density to be $n_{\textrm{B}}^{0}=0.15\,\textrm{fm}^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Three-hadron dynamics from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-hadron spectroscopy is a key frontier in our understanding of the hadron spectrum. In recent years, significant formal and numerical advances have paved the way for studying three-hadron processes directly from lattice QCD, with outstanding applications including the Roper resonance and the doubly charmed tetraquark. This requires theoretical frameworks that relate finite-volume energies to infinite-volume three-particle scattering amplitudes. In this contribution, I discuss recent progress in formulating such frameworks for generic three-hadron systems, and present numerical results for three-meson systems at maximal isospin with physical quark masses, as well as our recent investigation of the three-body dynamics of the doubly charmed tetraquark, $T_{\rm cc}$.</description>

      <title>De Sitter vacuum on nucleated D-branes with stringy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) vacuum solutions on probe D-branes which nucleate in an asymptotically $\text{AdS}_5\times T^{1,1}$ background, including stringy corrections. A sufficiently high chemical potential induced by the wrapped D3-brane charge, breaking supersymmetry in the bulk, is essential to lead to the nucleation of the probe D-brane. We show that stringy corrections can yield a dS vacuum on a spherical D3-brane consistent with the observations without being fine-tuned. Motivated by the fact that the matter fields propagating in the compact extra dimensions can provide solutions for problems in particle physics and cosmology, we also construct a dS vacuum on a probe D5-brane which wraps on a two-torus of the internal manifold $T^{1,1}$. This construction requires turning on a worldvolume U(1) gauge field along the wrapped part of the D5-brane and dissolving some D3-branes in it. The stringy corrections play an important role in yielding a dS vacuum and the field strength of the U(1) gauge field must be sufficiently large to produce a tiny cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Learning Method for Detecting Nucleon-Nucleon Correlations</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of nucleon-nucleon correlations on heavy-ion collisions using the hadronic transport model SMASH in $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV $^{197}{\rm Au}$+$^{197}{\rm Au}$ collisions. We developed an innovative Monte Carlo sampling method that incorporates both single-nucleon distributions and nucleon-nucleon correlations. By comparing three initial nuclear configurations - a standard Woods-Saxon distribution (un-corr), hard-sphere repulsion (step corr), and ab initio nucleon-nucleon correlations (nn-corr)- we revealed minimal differences in traditional observables except for ultra-central collisions. When distinguishing between un-corr and nn-corr configurations, conventional attention-based point cloud networks and multi-event mixing classifiers failed (accuracy ~50%). To resolve this, we developed a novel deep learning architecture integrating multi-event statistics and high-dimensional latent space feature correlations, achieving 60\% overall classification accuracy, which improved to 70\% for central collisions. This method enables the extraction of subtle nuclear structure signals through statistical analysis in high-dimensional latent space, offering a new paradigm for studying initial-state nuclear properties and quark-gluon plasma characteristics in heavy-ion collisions. It overcomes the limitations of traditional single-event analysis in detecting subtle initial-state differences.</description>

      <title>Universal critical behavior of generaliezd susceptibilities of net-baryon number at small quark mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the limit of small quark masses, the angle between the temperature axis and the applied magnetic field direction in the three-dimensional Ising model vanishes as $m_q^{2/5}$ when mapped onto the QCD $T-\mu_B$ phase plane. By selecting two distinct small angles and projecting the Ising model results onto QCD, we have investigated the universal critical behavior of the sixth-, eighth-, and tenth-order susceptibilities of the net-baryon number. When considering only the leading critical contribution, the negative dip in the $\mu_B$ dependence of the generalized susceptibilities is not universal, in contrast to the observation in the case where the angle is $90^{\circ}$. Its existence depends on the mapping parameters and the distance to the phase transition line. After incorporating the sub-leading critical contribution, the negative dip is enhanced to some extent but remains a non-robust feature. In contrast, the positive peak structure persists in all cases and represents a robust characteristic of generalized susceptibilities of the net-baryon number near the critical point.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Invariance Violation from Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LV) is examined through the time delay between high-energy and low-energy photons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previous studies determined the LV energy scale as $E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3.60 \times 10^{17}$~GeV using Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) data. This study updates the time-delay model and reaffirms these findings with new observations. High-energy photons from GRBs at GeV and TeV bands are analyzed, including the 99.3 GeV photon from GRB 221009A (FGST), the 1.07 TeV photon from GRB 190114C (MAGIC), and the 12.2 TeV photon from GRB 221009A (LHAASO). Our analysis, in conjunction with previous data, consistently shows that high-energy photons are emitted earlier than low-energy photons at the source. By evaluating 17 high-energy photons from 10 GRBs observed by FGST, MAGIC, and LHAASO, we estimate the LV energy scale to be $E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3.00 \times 10^{17}$ GeV. The null hypothesis of dispersion-free vacuum $E=pc$ (or, equivalently, the constant light-speed $v_{\gamma}=c$) is rejected at a significance level of 3.1$\sigma$ or higher.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Implies a Coupled Dark Sector: Insights from DESI DR2 via a Data-Driven Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) have revealed compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy, challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we adopt a data-driven, model-independent approach to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and its potential interaction with dark matter using combined background cosmological datasets, including DESI DR2, cosmic chronometers, observational Hubble data, and Type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Process regression and a non-parametric formalism, we first confirm a $\sim 2\sigma$ indication of dynamical dark energy, featuring a phantom crossing around redshift $z \sim 0.4$, consistent with DESI results. We then explore the implications of dynamical EoS from DESI DR2 for dark sector coupling. Incorporating priors on the EoS from DESI DR2, we find a $2.2\sigma$ signal for non-zero interactions between dark energy and dark matter at low redshift. Our results suggest that if DESI's evidence for time-varying dark energy is confirmed, a coupled dark sector may be a necessary extension beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>ALP Dark Matter from Kinetic Fragmentation: Opening up the Parameter Window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main mechanism responsible for Axion-Like-Particle (ALP) production in the early universe is the so-called misalignment mechanism. Three regimes have been investigated in this context: standard misalignment, large misalignment and kinetic misalignment. The latter applies if the axion inherits a large initial velocity in the early universe, such that the field rolls through many wiggles during its evolution, before it gets trapped in one minimum. This largely opens the region of parameter space for ALP dark matter towards higher values for the axion-photon coupling, which can be probed by the whole set of next decade's upcoming experiments. In fact, almost the entire parameter space in the [mass, decay constant] plane can now accommodate dark matter. In this paper, we show that in kinetic misalignment, the axion field is almost always entirely fragmented, meaning that the energy density of the homogeneous field is redistributed over higher-mode axions. We present a general model-independent analytical description of kinetic fragmentation, including discussion of the modified initial conditions for the mode functions due to the axion's initial velocity, and how they impact the growth of the adiabatic fluctuations. We calculate precisely the parameter regions corresponding respectively to standard misalignment, kinetic misalignment with weak fragmentation, fragmentation after trapping and fragmentation before trapping. While axion fragmentation can impact the precise determination of the relic abundance, another main observational implication is the formation of much denser compact axion halos, that is described in a companion paper. We also point out a new gravitational-wave signature that arises in the large misalignment regime with complete fragmentation and could be seen in measurements of $\mu$ distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>Lectures on perturbative unitarity and decoupling in Higgs physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lectures are a pedagogical introduction to the application of perturbative unitarity to Higgs physics within and beyond the Standard Model (SM). I begin with a review of how perturbative unitarity arises from quantum mechanical scattering theory and apply it to the classic problem of longitudinal vector boson scattering in the SM to derive the famous upper bound on the Higgs boson mass. I then consider extended Higgs sectors, using the two-Higgs-doublet model, the scalar septet model, and the Georgi-Machacek model as case studies. I discuss the resulting Higgs coupling sum rules as well as the intertwined constraints on masses and couplings of the additional Higgs bosons in these models, highlighting the connection between perturbative unitarity and the decoupling limit. I finish with a direct review of the decoupling limit in the two-Higgs-doublet model and a digression on the alignment limit. These notes are based on lectures delivered over the past few years in a graduate-level course on beyond-the-SM phenomenology and are meant as a companion volume to my TASI 2013 lectures on Higgs physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new on-shell method for the matching of ultraviolet models featuring massive states onto their massless effective field theory. We employ a dispersion relation in the space of complex momentum dilations to capture, in a single variable, the relevant analytic structure of scattering amplitudes at any multiplicity. Multi-variate complex analysis and crossing considerations are therefore avoided. Remarkably, no knowledge about the infrared effective field theory is required in dimensional regularisation. All matching information is extracted from the residues and discontinuities of the ultraviolet scattering amplitudes, which unitarity expresses in terms of lower-point and lower-loop results, respectively. This decomposition into simpler building blocks could deliver new insights in the structure of the effective field theories obtained from classes of ultraviolet scenarios and facilitate computations at higher loop orders.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Formalism: Joint Measurement for Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation for Errors by Squeezed Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error, disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive-Operator-Valued-Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes trivial, 0 = 0, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability, provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in agreement with Heisenberg's value.</description>

      <title>Threshold Effects on the Massless Neutrino in the Canonical Seesaw Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) among non-degenerate seesaw scales, i.e., threshold effects in the canonical seesaw mechanism, which have been obtained for more than two decades. Different from the previous work only focusing on the Weinberg operator, we derive the complete one-loop RGEs of all three dimension-five operators in the Standard Model effective field theory with right-handed neutrinos ($\nu$SMEFT) and apply them to threshold effects in the canonical seesaw mechanism. We find some contributions from the Weinberg operator to its Wilson coefficient, the neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix, and the Higgs quartic coupling absent in the previous calculations. Based on the updated one-loop RGEs, we derive the RGE of the effective neutrino mass matrix's determinant without any approximation. Then, for the first time, we provide a strict proof that the one-loop RG running effects among non-degenerate seesaw scales can not generate a non-zero mass for the initial massless neutrino in the minimal type-I seesaw mechanism or in the canonical one with a rank-degenerate neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix. One has to include two- or higher-loop corrections to achieve a non-zero mass for the massless neutrino.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal production of heavy vector dark matter from relativistic bubble walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy vector boson dark matter at the TeV scale or higher may be produced non-thermally in a first-order phase transition taking place at a lower energy scale. While the production of vector dark matter has previously been studied for bubble wall collisions, here we calculate production by bubble wall expansion in a plasma, which can be the dominant production mechanism. We compute the results numerically and provide an analytical fit for the vector dark matter density. The numerical fit is also validated for scalar dark matter production, obtaining results in agreement with past literature. We find that vector pair production leads to bubble wall friction with a novel boost factor scaling behaviour compared to transition radiation emission of a single vector. We conclude that TeV-scale WIMP vector dark matter can be efficiently produced non-thermally by first-order phase transitions in a wide region of parameter space where thermal freeze-out is inefficient. In this scenario, the phase transition scale is predicted to be in the sub-GeV to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV range and could therefore be accessible to future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>On the collider-testability of the type-I seesaw model with 3 right-handed neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If any heavy neutral leptons are discovered in accelerator-based experiments, key questions will involve their possible connection to neutrino masses or leptogenesis. Working in a renormalisable extension of the Standard Model by three right-handed neutrinos, we address the question of how much information about the fundamental model parameters can be obtained by measuring the branching ratios in the decays of the heavy neutral leptons into individual SM generations. We find that, provided that these branching ratios could be measured with arbitrary precision and assuming kinematically distinguishable right-handed neutrinos, they can be sufficient to pin down all 18 parameters of the model when supplemented with light neutrino oscillation data. When considering a finite statistical uncertainty comparable to that which can be achieved by future lepton colliders like FCC-ee or CEPC in the mass range of tens of GeV, some parameter degeneracies remain, but measurements would still provide powerful consistency checks of the model. In the sub-GeV range a good sensitivity to individual model parameters can be expected for SHiP and potentially for DUNE. This shows the potential of these experiments to not only discover heavy neutral leptons, but play an important role in understanding their role in particle physics and cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the twist-2 distribution amplitudes of the scalar mesons $a_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(1450)$ in the two-quark picture. The moments of these scalar mesons are obtained up to the third order with QCD sum rules method. With these moments, the first two Gegenbauer coefficients are determined and utilized to analyze the twist-2 distribution amplitudes. Our numerical results indicate that the meson $a_{0}(980)$ favors a conventional two-quark ground state. The paper concludes with an examination of the form factors for the transitions $B/D\rightarrow a_{0}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of chirality imbalance in SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Study of rare top quark decays into a jet plus a charged pseudo-scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-inclusive decay processes of a top quark into a charged pseudo-scalar meson and a jet are studied within the framework of QCD factorization. The leading power of the decay matrix elements can be factorized into heavy-to-light quark transition current and a hadron matrix element up to next-to-leading order QCD corrections. We calculate one-loop virtual corrections together with real gluon emission corrections at the {\alpha}s order. The numerical results of the branching ratios are presented for the sum of two-body and three-body decays. We also study the energy cut-off dependence of the gluon jet. These processes are hopeful to be detected in the near future experiments, which can serve as probes for new physics.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal leading-twist distribution amplitude of the $^1P_1$-state $b_1(1235)$ meson and its implications on $B\to b_1(1235)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we derive the $\xi$-moments $\langle\xi_{2;b_1}^{n;\|}\rangle$ of the longitudinal leading-twist distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;b_1}^{\|}$ for $^1P_1$-state $b_1(1235)$-meson by using the QCD sum rules under the background field theory. Considering the contributions from the vacuum condensates up to dimension-six, its first two non-zero $\xi$-moments at the scale 1 GeV are $\langle\xi_{2;b_1}^{1;\|}\rangle= -0.647^{+0.118}_{-0.113}$ and $\langle\xi_{2;b_1}^{3;\|}\rangle = -0.328^{+0.055}_{-0.052}$, respectively. Using those moments, we then fix the Gegenbauer expansion series of $\phi_{2;b_1}^{\|}$ and apply it to calculate $B\to b_1(1235)$ transition form factors (TFFs) that are derived by using the QCD light-cone sum rules. Those TFFs are then extrapolated to the physically allowable $q^2$-range via the simplified series expansion. As for the branching fractions, we obtain ${\cal B}(\bar B^0 \to b_1^+(1235)e^- \bar\nu_e) = 2.179^{+0.553}_{-0.422}\times 10^{-4}$, ${\cal B}(B^0 \to b_1^-(1235)\mu^+\nu_\mu) = 2.166^{+0.544}_{-0.415}\times 10^{-4}$, ${\cal B}(B^+ \to b_1^0(1235)e^+\nu_e) = 2.353^{+0.597}_{-0.456}\times 10^{-4}$, and ${\cal B}(B^+ \to b_1^0(1235)\mu^+\nu_\mu) = 2.339^{+0.587}_{-0.448}\times 10^{-4}$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxation of the magnetic field in rigidly rotating quark-gluon plasma is studied. It is shown that the infrared modes satisfying $k &lt; |m|\Omega$ and $k&lt; |m\pm 1|\Omega$, where integer $m$ is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the rotating axis and $\Omega$ is the angular velocity, are unstable. The instability onset time and the magnetic field growth rate are computed for a standard initial profile of the magnetic field. Given the present phenomenological values of $\Omega$ and electrical conductivity $\sigma$ the instability is not expected to be a significant factor in the field's time evolution.</description>

      <title>Probes of Anomalous Events at LHC with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), built on a neural network architecture, for the probe of a rare top decay, mediated by Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC), to charm and the Higgs boson, with the Higgs boson further decaying to a pair of b-quarks or a pair of gauge bosons ($W^{\pm}/Z$) in a boosted regime. Ideally, the particles originating from the decay of the boosted top lead to the reconstruction of a large-R jet, comprising three-prong substructures, with b- and c-tagged subjets. We have illustrated that SOM can be effectively implemented as an anomaly-finder for model-agnostic probes of such decay at the LHC. Relatively simple in formalism, this algorithm achieves commendable performance over other existing formalisms, tailored to probe this rare decay. We discuss the robustness of this algorithm, which can be successfully implemented for other BSM probes, both for model-agnostic and model-dependent searches.</description>

      <title>Exploring percolation phase transition in the three-dimensional Ising model with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The percolation study offers valuable insights into the characteristics of phase transition, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that govern the formation of global connectivity within the system. We explore the percolation phase transition in the 3D cubic Ising model by employing two machine learning techniques. Our results demonstrate the capability of machine learning methods in distinguishing different phases during the percolation transition. Through the finite-size scaling analysis on the output of the neural networks, the percolation temperature and a correlation length exponent in the geometrical percolation transition are extracted and compared to those in the thermal magnetization phase transition within the 3D Ising model. These findings provide a valuable way essential for enhancing our understanding of the property of the QCD critical point, which belongs to the same universality class as the 3D Ising model.</description>

Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <title>Probing the early universe with future GW observatories</title>

Abstract: One of the fundamental characteristics of slow roll inflation is its generation of tensor perturbations, which manifest as stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GWs due to the density fluctuation in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Axio-dilaton Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories it is the two-derivative sigma-model interactions that like to compete at low energies with the two-derivative interactions of General Relativity (GR) $\unicode{x2014}$ at least once the dangerous zero-derivative terms of the scalar potential are suppressed (such as by a shift symmetry). But nontrivial two-derivative interactions require at least two scalars to exist and so never arise in the single-scalar models most commonly explored. Axio-dilaton models provide a well-motivated minimal class of models for which these self-interactions can be explored. We review this class of models and investigate whether these minimal two fields can suffice to describe both Dark Matter and Dark Energy. We find that they can $\unicode{x2014}$ the axion is the Dark Matter and the dilaton is the Dark Energy $\unicode{x2014}$ and that they robustly predict several new phenomena for the CMB and structure formation that can be sought in observations. These include specific types of Dark Energy evolution and small space- and time-dependent changes to particle masses post-recombination that alter the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, cause small changes to structure growth and more.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of charmed hadrons across chiral crossover from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use up to fourth-order charm fluctuations and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations, calculated within the framework of lattice QCD, to study the continuum partial pressure contributions of charmed baryons and mesons. We show that, at and below the chiral crossover temperature, these partial pressures receive enhanced contributions from experimentally unobserved charmed hadrons predicted by the Quark Model. Additionally, we demonstrate that at the chiral crossover, the Hadron Resonance Gas description breaks down, signaling the modification of open charm hadrons and thereby implying the onset of charm deconfinement. We present evidence for the survival of low-lying non-radial $1S$ and $1P$ hadron-like excitations above the chiral crossover, which hints at the sequential melting of charmed hadrons. Finally, we investigate the continuum partial pressure contribution of charm quark-like excitation that emerges at the chiral crossover and calculate its temperature-dependent in-medium mass.</description>

Abstract: Sub-nuclear fluctuations in the initial state of heavy-ion collisions impact not only transverse long-range correlations of small systems, but also the creation of longitudinal structures, seen in particle detectors as longitudinal decorrelation observables. In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity correlations in nuclear collisions based on the 3D resolved McDIPPER initial state model, and for the first time, connect it to experimental observables using the 3+1D viscous hydrodynamics framework CLVisc. We include different sources of fluctuations at the nucleon and subnucleon level and study the effects of these additional fluctuation sources on the longitudinal structure of relevant observables, such as the flow decorrelations and directed flow.</description>

      <title>General Constraints on Isocurvature from the CMB and Ly-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological data are well-described by the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which assumes adiabatic initial conditions for the primordial density perturbations. This agreement between data and theory enables strong constraints on new physics that generates isocurvature perturbations. Existing constraints typically assume a simple power law form for the isocurvature power spectrum. However, many new physics scenarios -- such as cosmological phase transitions and gravitational particle production -- can deviate from this assumption. To derive general constraints which apply to a wide variety of new physics scenarios, we consider four types of isocurvature modes (dark matter, baryon, dark radiation and neutrino density isocurvature) and parametrize the isocurvature power spectrum using two general forms: a delta function and a broken power law. Using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and CMB spectral distortions, we place constraints on the isocurvature power spectrum across a wide range of scales, from $10^{-4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $10^{4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>
