      <title>Einstein's Happiest Moment: The Equivalence Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein's happiest thought was his leap from the observation that a falling person feels no gravity to the realization that gravity might be equivalent to acceleration. It affects all bodies in the same way because it is a property of spacetime -- its curvature -- not a force propagating through spacetime (like electromagnetic or nuclear forces). When expressed in a way that is manifestly independent of the choice of coordinates, this idea became General Relativity. But the ground for what is now known as the "equivalence principle" was laid long before Einstein, affording a fascinating example of the growth of a scientific idea through the continuous interplay between theory and experiment. That story continues through the present era, with improved techniques and measurements, and in the new environment of space. Theoretically, equivalence is now understood to rank with Lorentz invariance as one of nature's most fundamental principles. Violations of equivalence are generically predicted by attempts to unify gravity with "non-geometrical" fundamental interactions, but there is no consensus on the form that these violations will take. Experimental tests of equivalence thus face the challenge of striving simultaneously for the highest possible sensitivity and diversity in test materials.</description>

      <title>Is the Wavefunction Already an Object on Space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of quantum mechanics, the fact that the wavefunction is defined on the $3\mathbf{n}$-dimensional configuration space rather than on the $3$-dimensional space has seemed uncanny to many, including Schr\"odinger, Lorentz, and Einstein. Even today, this continues to be seen as a significant issue in the foundations of quantum mechanics. In this article, it will be shown that the wavefunction is, in fact, a genuine object on space. While this may seem surprising, the wavefunction does not possess qualitatively new features that were not previously encountered in objects known from Euclidean geometry and classical physics. The methodology used involves finding equivalent reinterpretations of the wavefunction exclusively in terms of objects from the geometry of space. The result is that we will find the wavefunction to be equivalent to geometric objects on space in the same way as was always the case in geometry and physics. This will be demonstrated to hold true from the perspective of Euclidean geometry, but also within Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, which naturally fits into the classification of quantum particles by the representations of spacetime isometries, as realized by Wigner and Bargmann, adding another layer of confirmation. These results lead to clarifications in the debates about the ontology of the wavefunction. From an empirical perspective, we already take for granted that all quantum experiments take place in space. I suggest that the reason why this works is that they can be interpreted naturally and consistently with the results presented here, showing that the wavefunction is an object on space.</description>
