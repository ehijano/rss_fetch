      <title>On Domain Decomposition for Magnetostatic Problems in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of three dimensional magnetostatic problems plays an important role, for example when simulating synchronous electric machines. Building on prior work that developed a domain decomposition algorithm using isogeometric analysis, this paper extends the method to support subdomains composed of multiple patches. This extension enables load-balancing across available CPUs, facilitated by graph partitioning tools such as METIS. The proposed approach enhances scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for large-scale simulations in diverse industrial contexts.</description>

      <title>A Direct-adjoint Approach for Material Point Model Calibration with Application to Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for the calibration of material parameters in elastoplastic constitutive models. The calibration is posed as a constrained optimization problem, where the constitutive evolution equations serve as constraints. The objective function quantifies the mismatch between the stress predicted by the model and corresponding experimental measurements. To improve calibration efficiency, a novel direct-adjoint approach is presented to compute the Hessian of the objective function, which enables the use of second-order optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation (AD) is used for gradient and Hessian computations. Two numerical examples are employed to validate the Hessian matrices and to demonstrate that the Newton-Raphson algorithm consistently outperforms gradient-based algorithms such as L-BFGS-B.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the integration of advanced simulation technologies with artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing science and engineering research. ChronoLlama introduces a novel framework that customizes the open-source LLMs, specifically for code generation, paired with PyChrono for multi-physics simulations. This integration aims to automate and improve the creation of simulation scripts, thus enhancing model accuracy and efficiency. This combination harnesses the speed of AI-driven code generation with the reliability of physics-based simulations, providing a powerful tool for researchers and engineers. Empirical results indicate substantial enhancements in simulation setup speed, accuracy of the generated codes, and overall computational efficiency. ChronoLlama not only expedites the development and testing of multibody systems but also spearheads a scalable, AI-enhanced approach to managing intricate mechanical simulations. This pioneering integration of cutting-edge AI with traditional simulation platforms represents a significant leap forward in automating and optimizing design processes in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Demystification and Near-perfect Estimation of Minimum Gas Limit and Gas Used for Ethereum Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ethereum blockchain has a \emph{gas system} that associates operations with a cost in gas units. Two central concepts of this system are the \emph{gas limit} assigned by the issuer of a transaction and the \emph{gas used} by a transaction. The former is a budget that must not be exhausted before the completion of the transaction execution; otherwise, the execution fails. Therefore, it seems rather essential to determine the \emph{minimum gas limit} that ensures the execution of a transaction will not abort due to the lack of gas. Despite its practical relevance, this concept has not been properly addressed. In the literature, gas used and minimum gas limit are conflated. This paper proposes a precise notion of minimum gas limit and how it can differ from gas used by a transaction; this is also demonstrated with a quantitative study on real transactions of the Ethereum blockchain. Another significant contribution is the proposition of a fairly precise estimator for each of the two metrics. Again, the confusion between these concepts has led to the creation of estimators only for the gas used by a transaction. We demonstrate that the minimum gas limit for the state of the Ethereum blockchain (after the block) $t$ can serve as a near-perfect estimation for the execution of the transaction at block $t + \Delta$, where $\Delta \leq 11$; the same holds for estimating gas used. These precise estimators can be very valuable in helping the users predict the gas budget of transactions and developers in optimising their smart contracts; over and underestimating gas used and minimum gas limit can lead to a number of practical issues. Overall, this paper serves as an important reference for blockchain developers and users as to how the gas system really works.</description>

      <title>Constructing Boundary-identical Microstructures via Guided Diffusion for Fast Multiscale Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical structures exhibit critical features across multiple scales. However, designing multiscale structures demands significant computational resources, and ensuring connectivity between microstructures remains a key challenge. To address these issues, \textit{\textbf{large-range, boundary-identical microstructure datasets}} are successfully constructed, where the microstructures share the same boundaries and exhibit a wide range of elastic moduli. This approach enables highly efficient multiscale topology optimization. Central to our technique adopts a deep generative model, guided diffusion, to generate microstructures under the two conditions, including the specified boundary and homogenized elastic tensor. We generate the desired datasets using active learning approaches, where microstructures with diverse elastic moduli are iteratively added to the dataset, which is then retrained. %We achieve the desired datasets by active learning approaches which are alternately adding microstructures with diverse elastic modulus constructed by the deep generative model into the dataset and retraining the deep generative model. After that, sixteen boundary-identical microstructure datasets with wide ranges of elastic modulus %high property coverage are constructed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the obtained datasets over various multiscale design examples. Specifically, in the design of a mechanical cloak, we utilize macrostructures with $30 \times 30$ elements and microstructures filled with $256 \times 256$ elements. The entire reverse design process is completed within one minute, significantly enhancing the efficiency of the multiscale topology optimization.</description>

      <title>Micropolar elastoplasticity using a fast Fourier transform-based solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a micromechanical spectral formulation for obtaining the full-field and homogenized response of elastoplastic micropolar composites. A closed-form radial-return mapping is derived from thermodynamics-based micropolar elastoplastic constitutive equations to determine the increment of plastic strain necessary to return the generalized stress state to the yield surface, and the algorithm implementation is verified using the method of numerically manufactured solutions. Then, size-dependent material response and micro-plasticity are shown as features that may be efficiently simulated in this micropolar elastoplastic framework. The computational efficiency of the formulation enables the generation of large datasets in reasonable computing times.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Knowledge Minigraph Agents for Literature Review Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Literature reviews play a crucial role in scientific research for understanding the current state of research, identifying gaps, and guiding future studies on specific topics. However, the process of conducting a comprehensive literature review is yet time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework, collaborative knowledge minigraph agents (CKMAs), to automate scholarly literature reviews. A novel prompt-based algorithm, the knowledge minigraph construction agent (KMCA), is designed to identify relations between concepts from academic literature and automatically constructs knowledge minigraphs. By leveraging the capabilities of large language models on constructed knowledge minigraphs, the multiple path summarization agent (MPSA) efficiently organizes concepts and relations from different viewpoints to generate literature review paragraphs. We evaluate CKMAs on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, further revealing promising applications of LLMs in scientific research.</description>
