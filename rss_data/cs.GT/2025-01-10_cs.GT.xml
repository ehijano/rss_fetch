      <title>Reach Measurement, Optimization and Frequency Capping In Targeted Online Advertising Under k-Anonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth in the use of online advertising to foster brand awareness over recent years is largely attributable to the ubiquity of social media. One pivotal technology contributing to the success of online brand advertising is frequency capping, a mechanism that enables marketers to control the number of times an ad is shown to a specific user. However, the very foundation of this technology is being scrutinized as the industry gravitates towards advertising solutions that prioritize user privacy. This paper delves into the issue of reach measurement and optimization within the context of $k$-anonymity, a privacy-preserving model gaining traction across major online advertising platforms. We outline how to report reach within this new privacy landscape and demonstrate how probabilistic discounting, a probabilistic adaptation of traditional frequency capping, can be employed to optimize campaign performance. Experiments are performed to assess the trade-off between user privacy and the efficacy of online brand advertising. Notably, we discern a significant dip in performance as long as privacy is introduced, yet this comes with a limited additional cost for advertising platforms to offer their users more privacy.</description>

      <title>A New Value for Cooperative Games on Intersection-Closed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new allocation rule, the uniform-dividend value (UD-value), for cooperative games whose characteristic function is incomplete. The UD-value assigns payoffs by distributing the total surplus of each family of indistinguishable coalitions uniformly among them. Our primary focus is on set systems that are intersection-closed, for which we show the UD-value is uniquely determined and can be interpreted as the expected Shapley value over all positive (i.e., nonnegative-surplus) extensions of the incomplete game.
  We compare the UD-value to two existing allocation rules for intersection-closed games: the R-value, defined as the Shapley value of a game that sets surplus of absent coalition values to zero, and the IC-value, tailored specifically for intersection-closed systems. We provide axiomatic characterizations of the UD-value motivated by characterizations of the IC-value and discuss further properties such as fairness and balanced contributions. Further, our experiments suggest that the UD-value and the R-value typically lie closer to each other than either does to the IC-value.
  Beyond intersection-closed systems, we find that while the UD-value is not always unique, a surprisingly large fraction of non-intersection-closed set systems still yield a unique UD-value, making it a practical choice in broader scenarios of incomplete cooperative games.</description>

      <title>The Bakers and Millers Game with Restricted Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strategic location choice by customers and sellers, termed the Bakers and Millers Game in the literature. In our generalized setting, each miller can freely choose any location for setting up a mill, while each baker is restricted in the choice of location for setting up a bakery. For optimal bargaining power, a baker would like to select a location with many millers to buy flour from and with little competition from other bakers. Likewise, a miller aims for a location with many bakers and few competing millers. Thus, both types of agents choose locations to optimize the ratio of agents of opposite type divided by agents of the same type at their chosen location. Originally raised in the context of Fractional Hedonic Games, the Bakers and Millers Game has applications that range from commerce to product design.
  We study the impact of location restrictions on the properties of the game. While pure Nash equilibria trivially exist in the setting without location restrictions, we show via a sophisticated, efficient algorithm that even the more challenging restricted setting admits equilibria. Moreover, the computed equilibrium approximates the optimal social welfare by a factor of at most $2\left(\frac{e}{e-1}\right)$. Furthermore, we give tight bounds on the price of anarchy/stability.
  On the conceptual side, the location choice feature adds a new layer to the standard setting of Hedonic Games, in the sense that agents that select the same location form a coalition. This allows to naturally restrict the possible coalitions that can be formed. With this, our model generalizes simple symmetric Fractional Hedonic Games on complete bipartite valuation graphs and also Hedonic Diversity Games with utilities single-peaked at 0. We believe that this generalization is also a very interesting direction for other types of Hedonic Games.</description>

      <title>On Corrigibility and Alignment in Multi Agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corrigibility of autonomous agents is an under explored part of system design, with previous work focusing on single agent systems. It has been suggested that uncertainty over the human preferences acts to keep the agents corrigible, even in the face of human irrationality. We present a general framework for modelling corrigibility in a multi-agent setting as a 2 player game in which the agents always have a move in which they can ask the human for supervision. This is formulated as a Bayesian game for the purpose of introducing uncertainty over the human beliefs. We further analyse two specific cases. First, a two player corrigibility game, in which we want corrigibility displayed in both agents for both common payoff (monotone) games and harmonic games. Then we investigate an adversary setting, in which one agent is considered to be a `defending' agent and the other an `adversary'. A general result is provided for what belief over the games and human rationality the defending agent is required to have to induce corrigibility.</description>

      <title>Optimising expectation with guarantees for window mean payoff in Markov decision processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The window mean-payoff objective strengthens the classical mean-payoff objective by computing the mean-payoff over a finite window that slides along an infinite path. Two variants have been considered: in one variant, the maximum window length is fixed and given, while in the other, it is not fixed but is required to be bounded. In this paper, we look at the problem of synthesising strategies in Markov decision processes that maximise the window mean-payoff value in expectation, while also simultaneously guaranteeing that the value is above a certain threshold. We solve the synthesis problem for three different kinds of guarantees: sure (that needs to be satisfied in the worst-case, that is, for an adversarial environment), almost-sure (that needs to be satisfied with probability one), and probabilistic (that needs to be satisfied with at least some given probability $p$).
  We show that for fixed window mean-payoff objective, all the three problems are in $\mathsf{PTIME}$, while for bounded window mean-payoff objective, they are in $\mathsf{NP} \cap \mathsf{coNP}$, and thus have the same complexity as for maximising the expected performance without any guarantee. Moreover, we show that pure finite-memory strategies suffice for maximising the expectation with sure and almost-sure guarantees, whereas, for maximising expectation with a probabilistic guarantee, randomised strategies are necessary in general.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay between Social Welfare and Tractability of Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational tractability and social welfare (aka. efficiency) of equilibria are two fundamental but in general orthogonal considerations in algorithmic game theory. Nevertheless, we show that when (approximate) full efficiency can be guaranteed via a smoothness argument \`a la Roughgarden, Nash equilibria are approachable under a family of no-regret learning algorithms, thereby enabling fast and decentralized computation. We leverage this connection to obtain new convergence results in large games -- wherein the number of players $n \gg 1$ -- under the well-documented property of full efficiency via smoothness in the limit. Surprisingly, our framework unifies equilibrium computation in disparate classes of problems including games with vanishing strategic sensitivity and two-player zero-sum games, illuminating en route an immediate but overlooked equivalence between smoothness and a well-studied condition in the optimization literature known as the Minty property. Finally, we establish that a family of no-regret dynamics attains a welfare bound that improves over the smoothness framework while at the same time guaranteeing convergence to the set of coarse correlated equilibria. We show this by employing the clairvoyant mirror descent algortihm recently introduced by Piliouras et al.</description>

      <title>Competitive and Revenue-Optimal Pricing with Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In markets with budget-constrained buyers, competitive equilibria need not be efficient in the utilitarian sense, or maximise the seller's revenue. We consider a setting with multiple divisible goods. Firstly, we show that competitive equilibrium outcomes, and only those, are constrained utilitarian efficient, a notion of utilitarian efficiency that respects buyers' demands and budgets. Secondly, we establish that, when buyers have linear valuations, competitive equilibrium prices are unique and revenue-optimal for a zero-cost seller.</description>

      <title>Preference-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Data Coverage and Algorithmic Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of Preference-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PbMARL), exploring both theoretical foundations and empirical validations. We define the task as identifying the Nash equilibrium from a preference-only offline dataset in general-sum games, a problem marked by the challenge of sparse feedback signals. Our theory establishes the upper complexity bounds for Nash Equilibrium in effective PbMARL, demonstrating that single-policy coverage is inadequate and highlighting the importance of unilateral dataset coverage. These theoretical insights are verified through comprehensive experiments. To enhance the practical performance, we further introduce two algorithmic techniques. (1) We propose a Mean Squared Error (MSE) regularization along the time axis to achieve a more uniform reward distribution and improve reward learning outcomes. (2) We propose an additional penalty based on the distribution of the dataset to incorporate pessimism, improving stability and effectiveness during training. Our findings underscore the multifaceted approach required for PbMARL, paving the way for effective preference-based multi-agent systems.</description>
