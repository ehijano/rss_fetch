      <title>General quantum-classical dynamics as measurement based feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note derives the stochastic differential equations and partial differential equation of general hybrid quantum-classical dynamics from the theory of continuous measurement and general (non-Markovian) feedback. The advantage of this approach is an explicit parameterization, without additional positivity constraints. The construction also neatly separates the different effects: how the quantum influences the classical and how the classical influences the quantum. This modular construction gives a better intuition of what to expect from hybrid dynamics, especially when used to construct possibly fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>Natural Language, AI, and Quantum Computing in 2024: Research Ingredients and Directions in QNLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language processing is at the heart of current developments in artificial intelligence, and quantum computers are becoming available at the same time. This has led to great interest in quantum natural language processing, and several early proposals and experiments. This paper surveys the state of this area, showing how NLP-related techniques including word embeddings, sequential models, attention, and grammatical parsing have been used in quantum language processing. We introduce a new quantum design for the basic task of text encoding (representing a string of characters in memory), which has not been addressed in detail before.
  As well as motivating new technologies, quantum theory has made key contributions to the challenging questions of 'What is uncertainty?' and 'What is intelligence?' As these questions are taking on fresh urgency with artificial systems, the paper also considers some of the ways facts are conceptualized and presented in language. In particular, we argue that the problem of 'hallucinations' arises through a basic misunderstanding: language expresses any number of plausible hypotheses, only a few of which become actual, a distinction that is ignored in classical mechanics, but present (albeit confusing) in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Imperfect quantum networks with tailored resource states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement-based quantum networks exhibit a unique flexibility in the choice of entangled resource states that are then locally manipulated by the nodes to fulfill any request in the network. Furthermore, this manipulation is not uniquely defined and thus can be optimized. We tailor the adaptation of the resource state or pre-established entanglement to achieve bipartite communication in an imperfect setting that includes time-dependent memory errors. In this same setting, we study how the flexibility of this approach can be used for the distribution of entanglement in a fully asymmetric network scenario. The considered entanglement topology is a custom one based on the minimization of the required measurements to retrieve a Bell pair. The optimization of the manipulation and the study of such a custom entanglement topology are performed using the noisy stabilizer formalism, a recently introduced method to fully track noise on graph states. We find that exploiting the flexibility of the entanglement topology, given a certain set of bipartite requests, is highly favorable in terms of the fidelity of the final state.</description>

      <title>Lindblad-like quantum tomography for non-Markovian quantum dynamical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Lindblad-like quantum tomography (L$\ell$QT) as a quantum characterization technique of time-correlated noise in quantum information processors. This approach enables the estimation of time-local master equations, including their possible negative decay rates, by maximizing a likelihood function subject to dynamical constraints. We discuss L$\ell$QT for the dephasing dynamics of single qubits in detail, which allows for a neat understanding of the importance of including multiple snapshots of the quantum evolution in the likelihood function, and how these need to be distributed in time depending on the noise characteristics. By a detailed comparative study employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, we assess the accuracy and precision of L$\ell$QT of a dephasing quantum dynamical map that goes beyond the Lindblad limit, focusing on two different microscopic noise models that can be realised in either trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit architectures. We explore the optimization of the distribution of measurement times to minimize the estimation errors, assessing the superiority of each learning scheme conditioned on the degree of non-Markovinity of the noise, and setting the stage for future experimental designs of non-Markovian quantum tomography.</description>

      <title>Modeling local decoherence of a spin ensemble using a generalized Holstein-Primakoff mapping to a bosonic mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the decoherence that occurs in an entangling atomic spin-light interface can be simply modeled as the dynamics of a bosonic mode. Although one seeks to control the collective spin of the atomic system in the permutationally invariant (symmetric) subspace, diffuse scattering and optical pumping are local, making an exact description of the many-body state intractable. To overcome this issue we develop a generalized Holstein-Primakoff approximation for collective states which is valid when decoherence is uniform across a large atomic ensemble. In different applications the dynamics is conveniently treated as a Wigner function evolving according to a thermalizing diffusion equation, or by a Fokker-Planck equation for a bosonic mode decaying in a zero temperature reservoir. We use our formalism to study the combined effect of Hamiltonian evolution, local and collective decoherence, and measurement backaction in preparing nonclassical spin states for application in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Twisted simplicial distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of twisted simplicial distributions on simplicial principal bundles, which allow us to capture Bell's non-locality, and the more general notion of quantum contextuality. We leverage the classical theory of simplicial principal bundles, as well as structures on categories of such bundles, to provide powerful computational tools for analyzing twisted distributions in terms of both direct constructions in simplicial sets and techniques from homological algebra. We use these techniques to analyze our key examples: quantum distributions and operator-theoretic polytopes used in the classical simulation of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary quantum circuits on a fully integrated two-qubit computation register for a trapped-ion quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the implementation of arbitrary circuits on a universal two-qubit register that can act as the computational module in a trapped-ion quantum computer based on the quantum charge-coupled device architecture. A universal set of quantum gates is implemented on a two-ion Coulomb crystal of $^9$Be$^+$ ions using only chip-integrated microwave addressing. Individual-ion addressing is implemented using microwave micromotion sideband transitions; we obtain upper limits on addressing cross-talk in the register. Arbitrary two-qubit operations are characterized using the cycle benchmarking protocol.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Linear System Problem in Tensor Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving linear systems is at the foundation of many algorithms. Recently, quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs) have attracted great attention since they converge to a solution exponentially faster than classical algorithms in terms of the problem dimension. However, low-complexity circuit implementations of the oracles assumed in these QLSAs constitute the major bottleneck for practical quantum speed-up in solving linear systems. In this work, we focus on the application of QLSAs for linear systems that are expressed as a low rank tensor sums, which arise in solving discretized PDEs. Previous works uses modified Krylov subspace methods to solve such linear systems with a per-iteration complexity being polylogarithmic of the dimension but with no guarantees on the total convergence cost. We propose a quantum algorithm based on the recent advances on adiabatic-inspired QLSA and perform a detailed analysis of the circuit depth of its implementation. We rigorously show that the total complexity of our implementation is polylogarithmic in the dimension, which is comparable to the per-iteration complexity of the classical heuristic methods.</description>

      <title>Simulating the dynamics of large many-body quantum systems with Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of powerful numerical techniques has drastically improved our understanding of quantum matter out of equilibrium. Inspired by recent progress in the area of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, this paper highlights hybrid Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques as an innovative approach to efficiently simulate certain aspects of many-body quantum dynamics on classical computers. To this end, we explore the nonequilibrium dynamics of two large subsystems, which interact sporadically in time, but otherwise evolve independently from each other. We consider subsystems with tunable disorder strength, relevant in the context of many-body localization, where one subsystem can act as a bath for the other. Importantly, studying the full interacting system, we observe that signatures of thermalization are enhanced compared to the reference case of having two independent subsystems. Notably, with the here proposed Schr\"odinger-Feynman method, we are able to simulate the pure-state survival probability in systems significantly larger than accessible by standard sparse-matrix techniques.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Long-Time Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems by Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerically computing physical quantities of time-evolved states in quantum many-body systems is a challenging task in general. Here, we propose a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior. The method is based on the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. The effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are studied, even when the input data exhibits complicated features such as multiple oscillatory components and a power-law decay with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. It is demonstrated that the present method enables accurate forecasts at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percent of noise does not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.</description>

      <title>Is Winter Coming?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically examine the often-made observation that "quantum winter [or some other winter] is coming", and the related admonition to prepare for this or that winter, inevitably bound to arrive. What we find based on even the most superficial look at the available evidence is that such statements not only are overblown hype, but are also factually wrong: Winter is here, and the real question is rather for how long it/they will stay.</description>

      <title>Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication and sensing technology play a significant role in various aspects of modern society. A seamless combination of the communication and the sensing systems is desired and have attracted great interests in recent years. Here, we propose and demonstrate a network architecture that integrating the downstream quantum access network (DQAN) and vibration sensing in optical fibers. By encoding the key information of eight users simultaneously on the sidemode quantum states of a single laser source and successively separating them by a filter network, we achieve a secure and efficient DQAN with an average key rate of 1.88*10^4 bits per second over an 80 km single-mode fiber. Meanwhile, the vibration location with spatial resolution of 120 m, 24 m, and 8 m at vibration frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 10 kHz, respectively, is implemented with the existing infrastructure of the DQAN system. Our integrated architecture provides a viable and cost-effective solution for building a secure quantum communication sensor network, and open the way for expanding the functionality of quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Gate generation for open quantum systems via a monotonic algorithm with time optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a monotonic numerical algorithm including time optimization for generating quantum gates for open systems. Such systems are assumed to be governed by Lindblad master equations for the density operators on a large Hilbert-space whereas the quantum gates are relative to a sub-space of small dimension. Starting from an initial seed of the control input, this algorithm consists in the repetition of the following two steps producing a new control input: (A) backwards integration of adjoint Lindblad-Master equations (in the Heisenberg-picture) from a set of final conditions encoding the quantum gate to generate; (B) forward integration of Lindblad-Master equations in closed-loop where a Lyapunov based control produced the new control input. The numerical stability is ensured by the stability of both the open-loop adjoint backward system and the forward closed-loop system. A clock-control input can be added to the usual control input. The obtained monotonic algorithm allows then to optimise not only the shape of the control imput, but also the gate time. Preliminary numerical implementations indicate that this algorithm is well suited for cat-qubit gates, where Hilbert-space dimensions (2 for the Z-gate and 4 for the CNOT-gate) are much smaller than the dimension of the physical Hilbert-space involving mainly Fock-states (typically 20 or larger for a single cat-qubit). This monotonic algorithm, based on Lyapunov control techniques, is shown to have a straightforward interpretation in terms of optimal control: its stationary conditions coincides with the first-order optimality conditions for a cost depending linearly on the final values of the quantum states.</description>

      <title>Unobserving the Moon: the spurious possibility of orbital decoupling due to solar neutrino Arago spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arago spot is an intensity maximum at the center of a shadow created by constructive interference of diffracted waves around a spherical object. While the study of diffraction patterns usually concerns visible light, de Broglie's wave nature of matter makes diffraction theory applicable for particles, such as neutrinos, as well. During a solar eclipse, some of the neutrinos emitted by the Sun are diffracted by the Moon, resulting in a diffraction pattern that can be observed on Earth. In this paper we consider the theoretically emerging solar neutrino Arago spot as a means to measure the location of the Moon with high accuracy and consider its implication on the orbit of the Moon given Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Our results indicate that the Moon is not at immediate risk of orbital decoupling due to the observation of a solar neutrino Arago spot.</description>

      <title>QestOptPOVM: An iterative algorithm to find optimal measurements for quantum parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation holds significant promise for achieving high precision through the utilization of the most informative measurements. While various lower bounds have been developed to assess the best accuracy for estimates, they are not tight, nor provide a construction of the optimal measurement in general. Thus, determining the explicit forms of optimal measurements has been challenging due to the non-trivial optimization. In this study, we introduce an algorithm, termed QestOptPOVM, designed to directly identify optimal positive operator-valued measure (POVM) using the steepest descent method. Through rigorous testing on several examples for multiple copies of qubit states (up to six copies), we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed algorithm. Moreover, a comparative analysis between numerical results and established lower bounds serves to validate the tightness of the Nagaoka-Hayashi bound in finite-sample quantum metrology for our examples. Concurrently, our algorithm functions as a tool for elucidating the explicit forms of optimal POVMs, thereby enhancing our understanding of quantum parameter estimation methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of storing energy efficiently and sustainably is highly prominent within modern scientific investigations. Due to the ongoing trend of miniaturization, the design of expressly quantum storage devices is itself a crucial task within current quantum technological research. Here we provide a transparent analytic model of a two-component quantum battery, composed of a charger and an energy holder, which is driven by a short laser pulse. We provide simple expressions for the energy stored in the battery, the maximum amount of work which can be extracted, both the instantaneous and the average powers, and the relevant charging times. This allows us to discuss explicitly the optimal design of the battery in terms of the driving strength of the pulse, the coupling between the charger and the holder, and the inevitable energy loss into the environment. We anticipate that our theory can act as a helpful guide for the nascent experimental work building and characterizing the first generation of truly quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical engine at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a quantum critical Otto engine that is powered by finite temperature baths. We show that the work output of the engine shows universal power law behavior that depends on the critical exponents of the working medium, as well as on the temperature of the cold bath. Furthermore, higher temperatures of the cold bath allows the engine to approach the limit of adiabatic operation for smaller values of the time period, while the corresponding power shows a maximum at an intermediate value of the cold bath temperature. These counterintuitive results stems from thermal excitations dominating the dynamics at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic, Better, Faster, Stronger: Optimal control for approximate counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic protocols are employed across a variety of quantum technologies, from implementing state preparation and individual operations that are building blocks of larger devices, to higher-level protocols in quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation. The main drawback of adiabatic processes, however, is that they require prohibitively long timescales. This generally leads to losses due to decoherence and heating processes. The problem of speeding up system dynamics while retaining the adiabatic condition has garnered a large amount of interest, resulting in a whole host of diverse methods and approaches made for this purpose. This thesis is dedicated to the discovery of new ways to combine optimal control techniques with a universal method from STA: counterdiabatic driving (CD). The CD approach offers perfect suppression of all non-adiabatic effects experienced by a system driven by a time-dependent Hamiltonian regardless of how fast the process occurs. In practice, however, exact CD is difficult to derive often even more difficult to implement. The main result presented in the thesis is thus the development of a new method called counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD), which implements optimal control techniques in tandem with \emph{approximations} of exact CD in a way that maximises suppression of non-adiabatic effects.</description>

      <title>Analysis of classical and quantum mechanical concepts of probability: A synopsis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the central question of what a coherent concept of probability might look like that would do justice to both classical probability theory, axiomatized by Kolmogorov, and quantum theory. At a time when quanta are receiving increased and expanded attention -- think, for example, of the advances in quantum computers or the promises associated with this new technology (National Academies of Sciences: Engineering, and Medicine, 2019) -- an adequate interpretation of probability, which is no less important, should be given due attention, particularly with regard to quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Generation of Spatially Coherent Light at Extreme Ultraviolet Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spatial coherence measurements of extreme-ultraviolet light generated using the process of high-harmonic upconversion of a femtosecond laser. Using a phase-matched hollow-fiber geometry, the generated beam is found to exhibit essentially full spatial coherence. The coherence of this laser-like EUV source is demonstrated by recording Gabor holograms of small objects. This work demonstrates the capability to do EUV holography using a tabletop experimental setup. Such an EUV source, with low divergence and high spatial coherence, can be used for experiments such as high-precision metrology, inspection of optical components for EUV lithography (1), and for microscopy and holography (2) with nanometer resolution. Furthermore, the short time duration of the EUV radiation (a few femtoseconds) will enable EUV microscopy and holography to be performed with ultrahigh time resolution.</description>

Abstract: We show that strong subadditivity provides a simple derivation of the $g$-theorem for the boundary renormalization group flow in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We work out its holographic interpretation and also give a derivation of the $g$-theorem for the case of an interface in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We also geometrically confirm strong subadditivity for holographic duals of conformal field theories on manifolds with boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible symmetries of quantum field theories and many-body systems generalize the concept of symmetries by allowing non-invertible operations in addition to more ordinary invertible ones described by groups. The aim of this paper is to point out that these non-invertible symmetries act on local operators by quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps between density matrices, which form a natural class of operations containing both unitary evolutions and measurements and play an important role in quantum information theory. This observation will be illustrated by the Kramers--Wannier duality of the one-dimensional quantum Ising chain, which is a prototypical example of non-invertible symmetry operations.</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectory of the one atom maser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of a quantum system undergoing repeated indirect measurements naturally leads to a Markov chain on the set of states which is called a quantum trajectory. In this paper we consider a specific model of such a quantum trajectory associated to the one-atom maser model. It describes the evolution of one mode of the quantized electromagnetic field in a cavity interacting with two-level atoms. When the system is non-resonant we prove that this Markov chain admits a unique invariant probability measure. We moreover prove convergence in the Wasserstein metric towards this invariant measure. These results rely on a purification theorem: almost surely the state of the system approaches the set of pure states. Compared to similar results in the literature, the system considered here is infinite dimensional. While existence of an invariant measure is a consequence of the compactness of the set of states in finite dimension, in infinite dimension existence of an invariant measure is not free. Furthermore usual purification criterions in finite dimension have no straightforward equivalent in infinite dimension.</description>

      <title>Controlling the dynamics of atomic correlations via the coupling to a dissipative cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the onset of periodic oscillations of coherences in an interacting bosonic gas coupled to a resonator after a quantum quench. This dynamics extends the collapse and revival features of atomic correlations in optical lattices to a dissipative scenario and exhibits hallmarks of synchronization. The behavior emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system, providing a general recipe to engineer intriguing quantum dynamics. Additionally, we show that the approximate symmetry can arise dynamically during self-organization and can be employed to obtain long-lived coherences.</description>

      <title>Study on a Quantization Condition and the Solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger-type Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study a quantization condition in relation to the solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger equations. This quantization condition is called the SWKB (supersymmetric Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) quantization condition and has been known in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for decades. The main contents of this thesis are recapitulated as follows: the foundation and the application of the SWKB quantization condition. The first half of this thesis aims to understand the fundamental implications of this condition based on extensive case studies. It turns out that the exactness of the SWKB quantization condition indicates the exact solvability of a system via the classical orthogonal polynomials. The SWKB quantization condition provides quantizations of energy, which we call the direct problem of the SWKB. We formulate the inverse problem of the SWKB: the problem of determining the superpotential from a given energy spectrum. The formulation successfully reconstructs all conventional shape-invariant potentials from the given energy spectra. We further construct novel solvable potentials, which are classical-orthogonal-polynomially quasi-exactly solvable, by this formulation. We further demonstrate several explicit solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the classical-orthogonal-polynomially quasi-exactly solvable potentials, whose family is referred to as a harmonic oscillator with singularity functions in this thesis. In one case, the energy spectra become isospectral, with several additional eigenstates, to the ordinary harmonic oscillator for special choices of a parameter. By virtue of this, we formulate a systematic way of constructing infinitely many potentials that are strictly isospectral to the ordinary harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference Experiment in Optical Fiber for the Undergraduate Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a quantum optics laboratory experiment that has recently become more accessible to undergraduate students. The experiment consists of two identical photons simultaneously entering a non-polarizing beam splitter. The wavefunctions destructively interfere and the photon pairs bunch at the outputs whereas classically they are equally likely to exit different outputs. Due to the precision needed to achieve indistinguishability, setup and alignment of this experiment is often considered to be too difficult and time consuming to be appropriate for an undergraduate lab, with an end goal of merely demonstrating the HOM interference dip. Here, we present an alternative optical fiber-based apparatus that gives a consistently reproducible experiment with interference occurring in a fused-fiber coupler instead of a traditional beam splitter. We use a commercially available fiber coupled biphoton source that requires minimal alignment and increases coherence length of the interference. In addition, our biphoton source provides direct temperature based control of the frequency degeneracy of the photon pairs produced, allowing for students to investigate physical properties of HOM interference such as coherence length and interference visibility. Through use of standard opto-mechanical parts combined with the commercially available fiber integrated biphoton source and laser, our apparatus is a middle ground between built-from-scratch and pre-aligned setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.10031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms with unitary oracles can be nested, which makes them extremely versatile. An example is the phase estimation algorithm used in many candidate algorithms for quantum speed-up. The search for new quantum algorithms benefits from understanding their limitations: Some tasks are impossible in quantum circuits, although their classical versions are easy, for example, cloning. An example with a unitary oracle $U$ is the if clause, the task to implement controlled $U$ (up to the phase on $U$). In classical computation the conditional statement is easy and essential. In quantum circuits the if clause was shown impossible from one query to $U$. Is it possible from polynomially many queries? Here we unify algorithms with a unitary oracle and develop a topological method to prove their limitations: No number of queries to $U$ and $U^\dagger$ lets quantum circuits implement the if clause, even if admitting approximations, postselection and relaxed causality. We also show limitations of process tomography, oracle neutralization, and $\sqrt[\dim U]{U}$, $U^T$, and $U^\dagger$ algorithms. Our results strengthen an advantage of linear optics, challenge the experiments on relaxed causality, and motivate new algorithms with many-outcome measurements.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation has been proposed as a means to combat unwanted and unavoidable errors in near-term quantum computing without the heavy resource overheads required by fault tolerant schemes. Recently, error mitigation has been successfully applied to reduce noise in near-term applications. In this work, however, we identify strong limitations to the degree to which quantum noise can be effectively `undone' for larger system sizes. Our framework rigorously captures large classes of error mitigation schemes in use today. By relating error mitigation to a statistical inference problem, we show that even at shallow circuit depths comparable to the current experiments, a superpolynomial number of samples is needed in the worst case to estimate the expectation values of noiseless observables, the principal task of error mitigation. Notably, our construction implies that scrambling due to noise can kick in at exponentially smaller depths than previously thought. They also impact other near-term applications, constraining kernel estimation in quantum machine learning, causing an earlier emergence of noise-induced barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms and ruling out exponential quantum speed-ups in estimating expectation values in the presence of noise or preparing the ground state of a Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes how far away a state is from the stabilizer states, making it an important resource in quantum computing, under the formalism of the Gotteman-Knill theorem. In this paper, we study the magic of the $1$-dimensional Random Matrix Product States (RMPSs) using the $L_{1}$-norm measure. We firstly relate the $L_{1}$-norm to the $L_{4}$-norm. We then employ a unitary $4$-design to map the $L_{4}$-norm to a $24$-component statistical physics model. By evaluating partition functions of the model, we obtain a lower bound on the expectation values of the $L_{1}$-norm. This bound grows exponentially with respect to the qudit number $n$, indicating that the $1$D RMPS is highly magical. Our numerical results confirm that the magic grows exponentially in the qubit case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) stand as a prominent strategy for constructing quantum machine learning models. These models comprise both a quantum and a classical component. The quantum facet is characterized by a parametrization $U$, typically derived from the composition of various quantum gates. On the other hand, the classical component involves an optimizer that adjusts the parameters of $U$ to minimize a cost function $C$. Despite the extensive applications of VQAs, several critical questions persist, such as determining the optimal gate sequence, devising efficient parameter optimization strategies, selecting appropriate cost functions, and understanding the influence of quantum chip architectures on the final results. This article aims to address the last question, emphasizing that, in general, the cost function tends to converge towards an average value as the utilized parameterization approaches a $2$-design. Consequently, when the parameterization closely aligns with a $2$-design, the quantum neural network model's outcome becomes less dependent on the specific parametrization. This insight leads to the possibility of leveraging the inherent architecture of quantum chips to define the parametrization for VQAs. By doing so, the need for additional swap gates is mitigated, consequently reducing the depth of VQAs and minimizing associated errors.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions induced by standard and predetermined measurements in transmon arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The confluence of unitary dynamics and non-unitary measurements gives rise to intriguing and relevant phenomena, generally referred to as measurement-induced phase transitions. These transitions have been observed in quantum systems composed of trapped ions and superconducting quantum devices. However, their experimental realization demands substantial resources, primarily owing to the classical tracking of measurement outcomes, known as post-selection of trajectories. In this work, we first describe the statistical properties of an interacting transmon array which is repeatedly measured, and predict the behavior of relevant quantities in the area-law phase using a combination of the replica method and non-Hermitian perturbation theory. We show numerically that a transmon array, modeled by an attractive Bose-Hubbard model, in which local measurements of the number of bosons are probabilistically interleaved, exhibits a phase transition in the entanglement entropy properties of the ensemble of trajectories in the steady state. Furthermore, by using deterministic feedback operations after the local number measurements, the distribution of the number of bosons measured at a single site carries information on the phase in the entanglement of individual trajectories. Interestingly, we can extract information about the phase and the phase transition from simple observables without considering an absorbing state in the feedback pattern. This implies that the feedback measurement approach might be a viable experimental option to use simple observables to study some aspects of the entanglement phase transition in individual trajectories.</description>

Abstract: Qudits with local dimension $d&gt;2$ can have unique structure and uses that qubits ($d=2$) cannot. Qudit Pauli operators provide a very useful basis of the space of qudit states and operators. We study the structure of the qudit Pauli group for any, including composite, $d$ in several ways. To cover composite values of $d$, we work with modules over commutative rings, which generalize the notion of vector spaces over fields. For any specified set of commutation relations, we construct a set of qudit Paulis satisfying those relations. We also study the maximum size of sets of Paulis that mutually non-commute and sets that non-commute in pairs. Finally, we give methods to find near minimal generating sets of Pauli subgroups, calculate the sizes of Pauli subgroups, and find bases of logical operators for qudit stabilizer codes. Useful tools in this study are normal forms from linear algebra over commutative rings, including the Smith normal form, alternating Smith normal form, and Howell normal form of matrices. Possible applications of this work include the construction and analysis of qudit stabilizer codes, entanglement assisted codes, parafermion codes, and fermionic Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

Abstract: Numerical simulation of turbulent fluid dynamics needs to either parameterize turbulence-which introduces large uncertainties-or explicitly resolve the smallest scales-which is prohibitively expensive. Here we provide evidence through analytic bounds and numerical studies that a potential quantum exponential speedup can be achieved to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations governing turbulence using quantum computing. Specifically, we provide a formulation of the lattice Boltzmann equation for which we give evidence that low-order Carleman linearization is much more accurate than previously believed for these systems and that for computationally interesting examples. This is achieved via a combination of reformulating the nonlinearity and accurately linearizing the dynamical equations, effectively trading nonlinearity for additional degrees of freedom that add negligible expense in the quantum solver. Based on this we apply a quantum algorithm for simulating the Carleman-linearized lattice Boltzmann equation and provide evidence that its cost scales logarithmically with system size, compared to polynomial scaling in the best known classical algorithms. This work suggests that an exponential quantum advantage may exist for simulating fluid dynamics, paving the way for simulating nonlinear multiscale transport phenomena in a wide range of disciplines using quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing of quantum information scrambling</title>

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is the dynamical process where initially localized quantum information spreads over diverse degrees of freedom. Out-of-time-order correlators and tripartite mutual information have been utilized as key metrics to investigate scrambling, with a specific emphasis on the asymptotic behaviors in the long-time regime and the initial spreads in the early-time regime. An open question is the comprehensive clarification of the dynamics of information propagation, covering the intermediate-time regime. Here, by extending the idea of quantum reservoir computing, we propose quantum reservoir probing (QRP) to diagnose scrambling in a unified manner for arbitrary degrees of freedom at arbitrary times, through information estimation performance. As a paradigmatic example, we investigate a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We show that the QRP successfully distinguishes between quasiparticle-mediated information propagation in a free fermion system and correlation-mediated scrambling in a quantum chaotic system, all while showcasing its experimental simplicity. Furthermore, by systematically scanning the read-out operators, we can identify the system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over the conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum limit to subdiffraction incoherent optical imaging. III. Numerical analysis</title>

Abstract: To investigate the fundamental limit to far-field incoherent imaging, the prequels to this work [M. Tsang, Phys. Rev. A 99, 012305 (2019); 104, 052411 (2021)] have studied a quantum lower bound on the error of estimating an object moment and proved a scaling law for the bound with respect to the object size. As the scaling law was proved only in the asymptotic limit of vanishing object size, this work performs a numerical analysis of the quantum bound to verify that the law works well for nonzero object sizes in reality. We also use the numerical bounds to study the optimality of a measurement called spatial-mode demultiplexing or SPADE, showing that SPADE not only follows the scaling but is also numerically close to being optimal, at least for low-order moments.</description>

      <title>Multi-site Integrated Optical Addressing of Trapped Ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most effective ways to advance the performance of quantum computers and quantum sensors is to increase the number of qubits or quantum resources in the system. A major technical challenge that must be solved to realize this goal for trapped-ion systems is scaling the delivery of optical signals to many individual ions. In this paper we demonstrate an approach employing waveguides and multi-mode interferometer splitters to optically address multiple $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions in a surface trap by delivering all wavelengths required for full qubit control. Measurements of hyperfine spectra and Rabi flopping were performed on the E2 clock transition, using integrated waveguides for delivering the light needed for Doppler cooling, state preparation, coherent operations, and detection. We describe the use of splitters to address multiple ions using a single optical input per wavelength and use them to demonstrate simultaneous Rabi flopping on two different transitions occurring at distinct trap sites. This work represents an important step towards the realization of scalable integrated photonics for atomic clocks and trapped-ion quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks will be able to service consumers with long-distance entanglement by use of quantum repeaters that generate Bell pairs (or links) with their neighbors, iid with probability $p$ and perform Bell State Measurements (BSMs) on the links that succeed iid with probability $q$. While global link state knowledge is required to maximize the rate of entanglement generation between any two consumers, it increases the protocol latency due to the classical communication requirements and requires long quantum memory coherence times. We propose two entanglement routing protocols that require only local link state knowledge to relax the quantum memory coherence time requirements and reduce the protocol latency. These protocols utilize multi-path routing protocol and time multiplexed repeaters. The time multiplexed repeaters first generate links for $k$-time steps before performing BSMs on any pairs of links. Our two protocols differ in the decision rule used for performing BSMs at the repeater: the first being a static path based routing protocol and second a dynamic distance based routing protocol. The performance of these protocols depends on the quantum network topology and the consumers' location. We observe that the average entanglement rate and the latency increase with the time multiplexing block length, $k$, irrespective of the protocol. When a step function memory decoherence model is introduced such that qubits are held in the quantum memory for an exponentially distributed time with mean $\mu$, an optimal $k$ ($k_\text{opt}$) value appears, such that for increasing $k$ beyond $k_{\rm opt}$ hurts the entanglement rate. $k_{\rm opt}$ decreases with $p$ and increases with $\mu$. $k_{\rm opt}$ appears due to the tradeoff between benefits from time multiplexing and the increased likelihood of previously established Bell pairs decohering due to finite memory coherence times.</description>

      <title>Charge-parity switching effects and optimisation of transmon-qubit design parameters</title>

Abstract: Enhancing the performance of noisy quantum processors requires improving our understanding of error mechanisms and the ways to overcome them. In this study, we identify optimal ranges for qubit design parameters, grounded in comprehensive noise modeling. To this end, we also analyze a previously unexplored error mechanism that can perturb two-qubit gates due to charge-parity switches caused by quasiparticles. Due to the utilization of the higher levels of a transmon, where the charge dispersion is significantly larger, a charge-parity switch will affect the conditional phase of the two-qubit gate. We derive an analytical expression for the infidelity of a diabatic controlled-Z gate and see effects of similar magnitude in adiabatic controlled phase gates in the tunable coupler architecture. Moreover, we show that the effect of a charge-parity switch can be the dominant quasiparticle-related error source of a two-qubit gate. We also demonstrate that charge-parity switches induce a residual longitudinal interaction between qubits in a tunable-coupler circuit. We present a performance metric for quantum circuit execution, encompassing the fidelity and number of single and two-qubit gates in an algorithm, as well as the state preparation fidelity. This comprehensive metric, coupled with a detailed noise model, empowers us to determine an optimal range for the qubit design parameters Substantiating our findings through exact numerical simulations, we establish that fabricating quantum chips within this optimal parameter range not only augments the performance metric but also ensures its continued improvement with the enhancement of individual qubit coherence properties. Our systematic analysis offers insights and serves as a guiding framework for the development of the next generation of transmon-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Darwinism-encoding transitions on expanding trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic, non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD, intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction, which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry breaking in the replica space.</description>

Abstract: We present an approach to estimate the operational distinguishability between an entangled state and any separable state directly from measuring an entanglement witness. We show that this estimation also implies bounds on a variety of other well-known entanglement quantifiers. This approach for entanglement estimation is then extended to to both the measurement-device-independent scenario and the fully device-independent scenario, where we obtain non-trivial but sub-optimal bounds. The procedure requires no numerical optimization and is easy to compute. It offers ways for experimenters to not only detect, but also quantify, entanglement from the standard entanglement witness procedure.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian networks are powerful tools for probabilistic analysis and have been widely used in machine learning and data science. Unlike the time-consuming parameter training process of neural networks, Bayes classifiers constructed on Bayesian networks can make decisions based solely on statistical data from samples. In this paper, we focus on constructing quantum Bayes classifiers (QBCs). We design both a naive QBC and three semi-naive QBCs (SN-QBCs). These QBCs are then applied to image classification tasks. To reduce computational complexity, we employ a local feature sampling method to extract a limited number of feature attributes from an image. These attributes serve as nodes of the Bayesian networks to generate the QBCs. We simulate these QBCs on the MindQuantum platform and evaluate their performance on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results demonstrate that these QBCs achieve good classification accuracies even with a limited number of attributes. The classification accuracies of QBCs on the MNIST dataset surpass those of classical Bayesian networks and quantum neural networks that utilize all available feature attributes.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz with Grover Mixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important property of QAOA with Grover mixer is that its expectation value is invariant over any permutation of states. As a consequence, the algorithm is independent of the structure of the problem. If, on the one hand, this characteristic raises serious doubts about the capacity of the algorithm to overcome the bound of the unstructured search problem, on the other hand, it can pave the way to its analytical study. In this sense, a prior work introduced a statistical approach to analyze GM-QAOA that results in an analytical expression for the expectation value depending on the probability distribution associated with the problem Hamiltonian spectrum. Although the method provides surprising simplifications in calculations, the expression depends exponentially on the number of layers, which makes direct analytical treatment unfeasible. In this work, we extend the analysis to the more simple context of Grover Mixer Threshold QAOA (GM-Th-QAOA), a variant that replaces the phase separation operator of GM-QAOA to encode a threshold function. As a result, we obtain an expression for the expectation value independent of the number of layers and, with it, we provide bounds for different performance metrics. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to a more general context of QAOA with Grover mixer, which we called Grover-based QAOA. In that framework, which allows the phase separation operator to encode any compilation of the cost function, we generalize all the bounds by using a contradiction argument with the optimality of Grover's algorithm on the unstructured search problem. As a result, we get the main contribution of this work, an asymptotic lower bound on the quantile achieved by the expectation value that formalizes the notion that the Grover mixer, at most, reflects a quadratic Grover-style speed-up over classical brute force.</description>

Abstract: Transmission lines are excellent examples of quantum simulators of quantum fields. By appropriately driving specific circuit elements, these devices can reproduce relativistic and quantum such as particle creation due to the non-adiabatic stimulation of the quantum vacuum. We investigate particle creation in left-handed transmission lines induced by the modulation of the Josephson energy in superconducting quantum interference devices. Our results show that, as a consequence of the peculiar dispersion relations present in these systems, particle production occurs with much more favorable conditions with respect to the usual right-handed transmission lines.</description>

Abstract: We introduce protocols to prepare many-body quantum states with quantum circuits assisted by local operations and classical communication. We show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called $W$ and, more generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas per site that are independent of the system size. As a biproduct of our work, we introduce an efficient scheme to implement certain non-local, non-Clifford unitary operators. We also discuss how similar ideas my be applied in the preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and interacting.</description>

Abstract: Verification of quantum computation is a task to efficiently check whether an output given from a quantum computer is correct. Existing verification protocols conducted between a quantum computer to be verified and a verifier necessitate quantum communication to unconditionally detect any malicious behavior of the quantum computer solving any promise problem in ${\sf BQP}$. In this paper, we remove the necessity of the communication of qubits by proposing a "physically classical" verification protocol in which the verifier just sends coherent light to the quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A striking feature of non-Hermitian systems is the presence of two different types of topology. One generalizes Hermitian topological phases, and the other is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, which are called line-gap topology and point-gap topology, respectively. Whereas the bulk-boundary correspondence is a fundamental principle in the former topology, its role in the latter has not been clear yet. This Letter establishes the bulk-boundary correspondence in the point-gap topology in non-Hermitian systems. After revealing the requirement for point-gap topology in the open boundary conditions, we clarify that the bulk point-gap topology in open boundary conditions can be different from that in periodic boundary conditions. On the basis of real space topological invariants and the $K$-theory, we give a complete classification of the open boundary point-gap topology with symmetry and show that the nontrivial open boundary topology results in robust and exotic surface states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes provide an explanation of the type classification of von Neumann algebras, which has made many appearances in recent work on entanglement in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The goal is to bridge a gap in the literature between resources that are too technical for the non-expert reader, and resources that seek to explain the broad intuition of the theory without giving precise definitions. Reading these notes will provide you with: (i) an argument for why "factors" are the fundamental von Neumann algebras that one needs to study; (ii) an intuitive explanation of the type classification of factors in terms of renormalization schemes that turn unnormalizable positive operators into "effective density matrices;" (iii) a mathematical explanation of the different types of renormalization schemes in terms of the allowed traces on a factor; (iv) an intuitive characterization of type I and II factors in terms of their "standard forms;" and (v) a list of some interesting connections between type classification and modular theory, including the argument for why type III$_1$ factors are believed to be the relevant ones in quantum field theory. None of the material is new, but the pedagogy is different from other sources I have read; it is most similar in spirit to the recent work on gravity and the crossed product by Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington, and Witten.</description>

Abstract: Information scrambling refers to the unitary dynamics that quickly spreads and encodes localized quantum information over an entire many-body system and makes the information accessible from any small subsystem. While information scrambling is the key to understanding complex quantum many-body dynamics and is well-understood in random unitary models, it has been hardly explored in Hamiltonian systems. In this Letter, we investigate the information recovery in various time-independent Hamiltonian systems, including chaotic spin chains and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We show that information recovery is possible in certain, but not all, chaotic models, which highlights the difference between information recovery and quantum chaos based on the energy spectrum or the out-of-time-ordered correlators. We also show that information recovery probes transitions caused by the change of information-theoretic features of the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the Hubbard model is crucial for investigating various quantum many-body states and its fermionic and bosonic versions have been largely realized separately. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides heterobilayers have emerged as a promising platform for simulating the rich physics of the Hubbard model. In this work, we explore the interplay between fermionic and bosonic populations, using a $\rm{WS}_2$/$\rm{WSe}_2$ heterobilayer device that hosts this hybrid particle density. We independently tune the fermionic and bosonic populations by electronic doping and optical injection of electron-hole pairs, respectively. This enables us to form strongly interacting excitons that are manifested in a large energy gap in the photoluminescence spectrum. The incompressibility of excitons is further corroborated by measuring exciton diffusion, which remains constant upon increasing pumping intensity, as opposed to the expected behavior of a weakly interacting gas of bosons, suggesting the formation of a bosonic Mott insulator. We explain our observations using a two-band model including phase space filling. Our system provides a controllable approach to the exploration of quantum many-body effects in the generalized Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction for a system of 2D anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons with a statistical phase parameter $\alpha\in(0,2)$ are a kind of quasi-particles that, for topological reasons, only exist in a 1D or 2D world. We consider the dimensional reduction for a 2D system of anyons in a tight wave-guide. More specifically, we study the 2D magnetic-gauge picture model with an imposed anisotropic harmonic potential that traps particles much stronger in the $y$-direction than in the $x$-direction. We prove that both the eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions are asymptotically decoupled into the loose confining direction and the tight confining direction during this reduction. The limit 1D system for the $x$-direction is given by the impenetrable Tonks-Girardeau Bose gas, which has no dependency on $\alpha$, and no trace left of the long-range interactions of the 2D model.</description>

      <title>Synthetic tensor gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields have provided physicists with a unique tool to explore a wide range of fundamentally important phenomena. However, most experiments have been focusing on synthetic vector gauge fields. The very rich physics brought by coupling tensor gauge fields to fracton phase of matter remain unexplored in laboratories. Here, we propose schemes to realize synthetic tensor gauge fields that address dipoles instead of single-particles. A lattice tilted by a strong linear potential and a weak quadratic potential yields a rank-2 electric field for a lineon formed by a particle-hole pair. Such a rank-2 electric field leads to a new type of Bloch oscillations, which modulate the quadrupole moment and preserve the dipole moment of the system. In higher dimensions, the interplay between interactions and vector gauge potentials imprints a phase to the ring-exchange interaction and thus generates synthetic tensor gauge fields for planons. Such tensor gauge fields make it possible to realize a dipolar Harper-Hofstadter model in laboratories. The resultant dipolar Chern insulators feature chiral edge currents of dipoles in the absence of net charge currents.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Oscillator with a Step and its Isospectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a harmonic oscillator with a finite jump $a$ at the origin. The solution is constructed by employing the ordinary matching-of-wavefunctions technique. For the special choices of $a$, $a=4\ell$ ($\ell=1,2,\ldots$), the wavefunctions can be expressed by the Hermite polynomials. Moreover, we explore isospectral deformations of the potential via the Darboux transformation. In this context, infinitely many isospectral Hamiltonians to the ordinary harmonic oscillator are obtained.</description>

      <title>Anomalous noise spectra in a spin-exchange-relaxation-free alkali-metal vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform spin-noise spectroscopy on an unpolarized $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ vapor in the spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF) regime. We observe noise spectral distributions that deviate strongly from Lorentzian models that accurately describe lower-density regimes. For example, at magnetic fields of $\sim 1 \mathrm{\mu T}$ and $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ densities $\gtrsim 1 \times 10^{14} \rm{atoms/cm^{3}}$ we observe an asymmetric spin-noise distribution in which the resonance line is depleted by about half its power, with the diverted power becoming a broad spectral component that could be mistaken for optical shot noise. The results are in good agreement with recent models accounting for correlations between the ground hyperfine states. We discuss implications for quantum sensing and absolute noise calibration in spin-squeezing and entanglement detection.</description>

      <title>Locality bounds for quantum dynamics at low energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the generic slowing down of quantum dynamics in low energy density states of spatially local Hamiltonians. Beginning with quantum walks of a single particle, we prove that for certain classes of Hamiltonians (deformations of lattice-regularized $H\propto p^{2k}$), the ``butterfly velocity" of particle motion at low energies has an upper bound that must scale as $E^{(2k-1)/2k}$, as expected from dimensional analysis. We generalize these results to obtain bounds on the typical velocities of particles in many-body systems with repulsive interactions, where for certain families of Hubbard-like models we obtain similar scaling.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum image classification and federated learning for hepatic steatosis diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of liver transplantation, accurately determining hepatic steatosis levels is crucial. Recognizing the essential need for improved diagnostic precision, particularly for optimizing diagnosis time by swiftly handling easy-to-solve cases and allowing the expert time to focus on more complex cases, this study aims to develop cutting-edge algorithms that enhance the classification of liver biopsy images. Additionally, the challenge of maintaining data privacy arises when creating automated algorithmic solutions, as sharing patient data between hospitals is restricted, further complicating the development and validation process. This research tackles diagnostic accuracy by leveraging novel techniques from the rapidly evolving field of quantum machine learning, known for their superior generalization abilities. Concurrently, it addresses privacy concerns through the implementation of privacy-conscious collaborative machine learning with federated learning. We introduce a hybrid quantum neural network model that leverages real-world clinical data to assess non-alcoholic liver steatosis accurately. This model achieves an image classification accuracy of 97%, surpassing traditional methods by 1.8%. Moreover, by employing a federated learning approach that allows data from different clients to be shared while ensuring privacy, we maintain an accuracy rate exceeding 90%. This initiative marks a significant step towards a scalable, collaborative, efficient, and dependable computational framework that aids clinical pathologists in their daily diagnostic tasks.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB analysis for ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics: Study of the Ai-Bender-Sarkar conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider exact WKB analysis to a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics defined by the potential, $V(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^2(i x)^{\varepsilon=2}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R} _{&gt; 0}$. We in particular aim to verify a conjecture proposed by Ai-Bender-Sarkar (ABS), that pertains to a relation between $D$-dimensional ${\cal PT}$-symmetric theories and analytic continuation (AC) of Hermitian theories concerning the energy spectrum or Euclidean partition function. For the purpose, we construct energy quantization conditions by exact WKB analysis and write down their transseries solution by solving the conditions. By performing alien calculus to the energy solutions, we verify validity of the ABS conjecture and seek a possibility of its alternative form by Borel resummation theory if it is violated. Our results claim that the validity of the ABS conjecture drastically changes depending on whether $\omega &gt; 0$ or $\omega = 0$: If ${\omega}&gt;0$, then the ABS conjecture is violated when exceeding the semi-classical level of the first non-perturbative order, but its alternative form is constructable by Borel resummation theory. The ${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies are related to each other by a one-parameter Stokes automorphism, and a median resummed form, which corresponds to a formal exact solution, of the AC energy (resp. ${\cal PT}$ energy) is directly obtained by acting Borel resummation to a transseries solution of the ${\cal PT}$ energy (resp. AC energy). If $\omega = 0$, then, with respect to the inverse energy level-expansion, not only perturbative/non-perturbative structures of the ${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies but also their perturbative parts do not match with each other. These energies are independent solutions, and no alternative form of the ABS conjecture can be reformulated by Borel resummation theory.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Solvers in Production: how to succeed in the NISQ era?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10302v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum computing is considered the present and the future within the field of quantum computing. Far from being a passing fad, this trend cannot be considered just a stopgap to address the limitations of NISQ-era devices. The foundations linking both computing paradigms will remain robust over time. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, we describe and categorize some of the most frequently used hybrid solvers, resorting to two different taxonomies recently published in the literature. Secondly, we put a special focus on two solvers that are currently deployed in real production and that have demonstrated to be near the real industry. These solvers are the LeapHybridBQMSampler contained in D-Wave's Hybrid Solver Service and Quantagonia's Hybrid Solver. We analyze the performance of both methods using as benchmarks four combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting separation-dependent coherence to boost optical resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of resolving point-like light sources not only serves as a benchmark for optical resolution but also holds various practical applications ranging from microscopy to astronomy. In this research, we aim to resolve two thermal sources sharing arbitrary mutual coherence using the spatial mode demultiplexing technique. Our analytical study includes scenarios where the coherence and the emission rate depend on the separation between the sources, and is not limited to the faint sources limit. We consider the fluorescence of two interacting dipoles to demonstrate that the dependence of emission characteristics on the parameter of interest can boost the sensitivity of the estimation and noticeably prolong the duration of information decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as in two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>
