      <title>Are we misdiagnosing ensemble forecast reliability? On the insufficiency of Spread-Error and rank-based reliability metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been documented that Spread-Error equality and a flat rank histogram are necessary but insufficient for demonstrating ensemble forecast reliability. Nevertheless, these metrics are heavily relied upon, both in the literature and at operational numerical weather prediction centers. In this study, we demonstrate theoretically why the Spread-Error relationship is necessary but insufficient for diagnosing reliability up to second order, even when mean bias is absent or accounted for. Assuming joint normality between ensemble members and the reference truth, we further show with idealized experiments that the same covariance structure responsible for this insufficiency also produces false diagnoses of reliability with the rank histogram and the reliability component of the continuous rank probability score. Under this structure and when the ensemble mean is meaningfully different from climatology, the truth lies among the least (most) extreme members when climatological variance is excessive (deficient) in each member. Importantly, this behavior is also shown to be plausible in operational ensemble weather forecasts. Combining these results with calibration principles from statistical postprocessing leads us to conclude that both perfect dispersion and underdispersion are ill-defined. When diagnostics are misinterpreted as indicating the latter, improper tuning can lead to further deterioration of forecast quality, even while improving Spread-Error and rank histogram behavior. To address these issues, we propose a new reliability diagnostic based on three easily computed statistics, motivated by the structure of the joint distribution of ensemble members and the reference truth up to second order. The diagnostic separates contributions to unreliability originating from climatology and predictability, enabling a more precise and robust characterization of ensemble behavior.</description>

      <title>Q-triplet characterization of atmospheric time series at Antofagasta: A missing values problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Located in northern Chile (23.7{\deg}S, 70.4{\deg}W), Antofagasta has an exceptionally arid and stable climate characterized by minimal precipitation and consistent weather patterns. Nevertheless, despite these climate conditions being meaningful for several research and practical applications, our understanding of weather dynamics remains limited. The available meteorological data from 1969 to 2016 is analogical, which presents a significant challenge to analyze because these records are riddled with missing values, some measurements were taken at irregular measuring intervals, making it an interesting puzzle to grasp the Antofagasta's climate scenario. To overcome this issue, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity time series. Our analytical approach involves the q-triplet calculation method, serving as a powerful tool to identify distinctive behavior within systems under non-equilibrium states. Our results suggest that, in general, the q-triplet values satisfy the condition $q_\text{sens}&lt;1&lt;q_\text{stat}&lt;q_\text{rel}$, a pattern that has been observed in previous studies.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Multi-Wavelength Underwater Optical Channels in the Presence of Optical Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the performance of a Gaussian optical beam as it propagates through the turbulent underwater optical channel (UWOC) under the weak turbulence regime, where optical signal experiences significant fading and scattering, all of which can severely degrade communication quality. It is assumed that on-off keying (OOK) modulation with direct detection is utilized to establish a duplex communication link. A multi-wavelength beam approach is implemented to enhance the performance by leveraging the distinct propagation characteristics of different wavelengths. Performance is established in terms of the probability of fade, number of fade per second, mean fade duration, and mean time between fades. The use of multi-wavelength beam is shown to enhance performance by a sizable margin.</description>

      <title>Scalable ADER-DG Transport Method with Polynomial Order Independent CFL Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are known to suffer from increasingly restrictive explicit time-step constraints as the polynomial order increases, limiting their efficiency at high orders for explicit time-stepping schemes. In this paper, we introduce a novel \emph{locally implicit}, but \emph{globally explicit} ADER-DG scheme designed for transport-dominated problems. The method achieves a maximum stable time step governed by an element-width based CFL condition that is independent of the polynomial degree. By solving a set of element-local implicit problems at each time step, our approach more effectively utilises the domain of dependence. As a result, our method remains stable for CFL numbers up to $\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. We provide a rigorous stability proof in one dimension, and extend the analysis to two and three dimensions using a semi-analytical von Neumann stability analysis. The accuracy and convergence of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments for both linear and nonlinear test cases, including numerical simulations of a transport problem on a cubed sphere 2D manifold embedded in 3D.</description>

      <title>Multi-faceted light pollution modelling and its application to the decline of artificial illuminance in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) has been increasing steadily over the past century, particularly during the last decade. This leads to rising light pollution, which is known to have adverse effects on living organisms, including humans. We present a new software package to model light pollution from ground radiance measurements. The software is called Otus 3 and incorporates innovative ALAN diffusion models with different atmospheric profiles, cloud covers and urban emission functions. To date, light pollution modelling typically focused on calculating the zenith luminance of the skyglow produced by city lights. In Otus 3 we extend this and additionally model the horizontal illuminance on the ground, including the contributions from skyglow and the direct illumination. We applied Otus 3 to France using ground radiance data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We calibrated our models using precise sky brightness measurements we obtained over 6 years at 139 different locations and make this dataset publicly available. We produced the first artificial illuminance map for France for the periods of 2013-2018 and 2019-2024. We found that the artificial ground illuminance in the middle of the night decreased by 23 % between these two periods, in stark contrast to the global trend.</description>
