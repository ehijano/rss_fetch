      <title>Dynamics of a Mobile Ion in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of the dynamics of an impurity immersed in a quantum medium is vital for fundamental understanding of matter as well as applications in modern day quantum technologies. The case of strong and long-ranged interactions is of particular importance here, as it opens the possibility to leverage quantum correlations in controlling the system properties. Here, we consider a charged impurity moving in a bosonic gas and study its properties out of equilibrium. We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory dynamics.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Borromean Super-counterfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of dynamical field theories for $N$-component "Borromean" ($N\geq 3$) super-counterfluid order, naturally formulated in terms of inter-species bosonic fields $\psi_{\alpha\beta}$. Their condensation breaks the normal-state [U(1)]$^N$ symmetry down to its diagonal U(1) subgroup, thereby encoding the arrest of the net superflow. This approach broadens our understanding of dynamical properties of super-counterfluids, at low energies capturing its universal properties, phase transition, counterflow vortices, and many of its other properties. Such super-counterfluid strikingly exhibits $N$ distinct flavors of energetically stable elementary vortex solutions, despite $\mathbb{Z}^{N-1}$ homotopy group of its $N\! -\! 1$ independent Goldstone modes, with $N\! -\! 1$ topologically distinct elementary vortex types, obeying modular arithmetic. The model leads to Borromean hydrodynamics as a low-energy theory, reveals counteflow AC Josephson effect, and generically predicts a first-order character of the phase transitions into Borromean super-counterfluid state in dimensions greater than two.</description>

      <title>Axially confined binary quantum droplets: ground states and central vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold miscible mixtures of bosonic gases have been observed to form quantum droplet states stabilized by beyond-mean-field quantum fluctuations. Here we study the properties of the droplets when subjected to harmonic trapping in one dimension, using a combination of numerical, variational and analytical approaches. We map out the phase diagram between bound droplets and the unbound gas state and the form of the ground states. We additionally consider how the droplet solutions are modified by the presence of a central vortex and use these results to estimate the critical rotation frequency for vortices to be energetically favored. Our work helps to understand the physics of self-bound droplets and vortex droplets in flattened geometries.</description>

      <title>Saturating interaction in coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rabi-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, with competing intra-and interspecies interactions, enable independent control of two-and three-body interactions. We show that coupling can also drive the system into a strongly nonlinear regime of saturating interaction. More precisely, the equation of state interpolates between low-and high-density regimes described by two different two-body scattering lengths. Interestingly, the transition can be determined by the strength of the coupling. We experimentally demonstrate this saturation phenomenon by measurements of the interaction energy of a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the detuning and of the strength of the Rabi coupling in spin mixtures of potassium 39.</description>

      <title>Condensate-mediated dimerization of impurities in atomic BECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that strongly correlated impurities confined in an optical lattice can form localized, molecule-like dimer states in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By systematically studying the effect of the lattice potential on this mixture, we reveal the two roles of the condensate in assisting the formation of dimerized impurities: mediating the attractive interaction among impurities and rescaling the lattice potential of impurities. At strong coupling between the impurities and the condensate, the two mechanisms cooperate to induce a structural transition, resulting in the rearrangement of dimers. We also show that the nonequilibrium dynamics of these states can be interpreted as a dimerized soliton train.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalization speed-up from quantum coherence after a sudden quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon reminiscent of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC) that arises in the transient dynamics following an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic and initial superposition states vanishes with a power law scaling with the number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and with an exponent that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped cold-atom system.</description>

      <title>On the fate of travelling waves at the boundary of quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum droplets formed in a two-dimensional symmetric mixture of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms. For sufficiently large atom numbers, these droplets exhibit a flat-top density profile with sharp boundaries governed by surface tension. Within the bulk of the droplet, traveling matter waves - localized density dips - can propagate at constant velocity while maintaining their shape. Using numerical simulations and qualitative analysis, we investigate the rich phenomenology that arises when such excitations reach the boundary of a finite droplet. We show that they can emit a small outgoing droplet, excite internal modes of the host soliton, or, in the case of vortex-antivortex pairs, split into individual vortices propagating backward near the edge. Furthermore, we demonstrate that traveling waves can be dynamically generated near the boundary through the collision of distinct droplets, and we discuss their trajectories and interactions.</description>

      <title>Non-interacting fractional topological Stark insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional topological phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall state, usually rely on strong interactions to generate ground state degeneracy with gap protection and fractionalized topological response. Here, we propose a fractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is driven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different from the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional topological phases. A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands drives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may hybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space energy gap (RSEG). Unlike the integer topological band insulator obtained in the weak linear potential regime without closing the original bulk gap, the fractional topological Stark insulating phase is resulted from the RSEG when the linear potential gradient exceeds a critical value. We develop a theoretical formalism to characterize the fractional topological Stark insulator, and further show that the many-body state under topological pumping returns to the initial state only after multiple $2\pi$ periods of evolution, giving the fractional charge pumping, similar to that in fractional quantum Hall state. Finally, we propose how to realize the fractional topological Stark insulator in real experiment.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamical Characterization of Ground State Phases Induced by Frustration and Magnetic Field in the Spin-1 Orthogonal Dimer Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration) and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.</description>

      <title>Low-energy atomic scattering: s-wave relation between the interaction potential and the phase shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the on-shell approximation in the context of s-wave scattering for ultracold two-body collisions. Our analysis systematically covers spatial dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials. Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions for quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have transformed atomic and molecular physics, now forming the backbone for a range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times, low-loss, and high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum science, particularly towards quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. We show room-temperature trapping lifetimes of 23 minutes, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We present a plan for zone-based quantum computing and demonstrate necessary coherence-preserving qubit transport and pick-up/drop-off operations on large spatial scales, characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, along with recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing and quantum error correction with thousands to tens of thousands of physical qubits could be a near-term prospect.</description>

      <title>A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. We present a compact and efficient RF circuit based on a capacitive transformer network, where a low-frequency coil operating up to 30MHz serves as both an intrinsic inductor and a power-sharing element. The design enables high current delivery and flexible impedance matching across a wide frequency range. We integrate both broadband and narrowband RF networks into a unified configuration that overcomes the geometric constraints imposed by the metallic chamber. In evaporative cooling, the broadband network allows a reduction of the applied RF input power from 14.7dBW to -3.5dBW, owing to its non-zero coil current even at ultra-low frequencies. This feature enables the Bose-Fermi mixture to be cooled below 10{\mu}K. In a Landau-Zener protocol, the coil driven by the narrowband network transfers 80% of rubidium atoms from |F = 2,mF = 2&gt; to |2,-2&gt; in 1 millisecond, achieving a Rabi frequency of approximately 9 kHz at an input power of 0.1dBW.</description>
