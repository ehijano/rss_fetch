      <title>Physics-informed continuous normalizing flows to learn the electric field within a time-projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate position reconstruction in noble-element time-projection chambers (TPCs) is critical for rare-event searches in astroparticle physics, yet is systematically limited by electric field distortions arising from charge accumulation on detector surfaces. Conventional data-driven field corrections suffer from three fundamental limitations: discretization artifacts that break smoothness and differentiability, lack of guaranteed consistency with Maxwell's equations, and statistical requirements of $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ calibration events. We introduce a physics-informed continuous normalizing flow architecture that learns the electric field transformation directly from calibration data while enforcing the constraint of field conservativity through the model structure itself. Applied to simulated $^{83\mathrm{m}}$Kr calibration data in an XLZD-like dual-phase xenon TPC, our method achieves superior reconstruction accuracy compared to histogram-based corrections when trained on identical datasets, demonstrating viable performance with only $6\times10^5$ events$\unicode{x2013}$an order of magnitude reduction in calibration requirements. This approach enables practical monthly field monitoring campaigns, propagation of position uncertainties through differentiable transformations, and enhanced background discrimination in next-generation rare-event searches.</description>

      <title>Investigating event-shape methods in the search for the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the measured anisotropy $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method fulfills the general premise of measuring the CME but is statistically hungry. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background-contributing sources, because of statistical fluctuations of intertwining variables used in the method, and is thus not practically useful or clean to measure the CME.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture, at once, dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability. This paper is complemented by a GitHub repository at https://github.com/FlaGer99/SLR-Spatio-Temporal-GNN.git providing additional interactive tools to further explore the presented findings.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamics of Superparamagnetic Colloidal Microrobots with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living organisms have developed advanced motion strategies for efficient space exploration, serving as inspiration for the movements of microrobots. These real-life strategies often involve anomalous dynamics displaying random movement patterns that deviate from Brownian motion. Despite their biological inspiration, autonomous stochastic navigation strategies of current microrobots remain much less versatile than those of their living counterparts. Supported by theoretical reasoning, this work demonstrates superparamagnetic colloidal microrobots with fully customizable stochastic dynamics displaying the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, across statistically significant spatial and temporal scales (covering at least two decades). By simultaneously tuning microrobots' step-length distribution and, critically, their velocity autocorrelation function with magnetic fields, fundamental anomalous dynamics are reproduced with tailored properties mimicking L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion. These findings pave the way for programmable microrobotic systems that replicate optimal stochastic navigation strategies found in nature for applications in medical robotics and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray tomography of shipping containers: A combination of complementary secondary particle and muon information using simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray tomography usually relies on measuring the scattering or transmission of muons produced within cosmic-ray air showers to reconstruct an examined volume of interest (VOI). During the traversing of a VOI, all air shower particles, including muons, interact with the matter within the VOI producing so-called secondary particles. The characteristics of the production of these particles contain additional information about the properties of the examined objects and their materials. However, this approach has not been fully realized practically. Hence, this work aims to study a novel technique to scan shipping containers by comparing and combining the complementary results from stand-alone secondary particles and muon scattering using simulated simplified scenes with a 1 m3 cube made out of five different materials located inside the container. The proposed approach for a statistical combination is based on a multi-step procedure centered around a clustering and segmentation algorithm. This ensures a consistent evaluation and comparison of the results before and after the combination focusing on dedicated properties of the reconstructed object. The findings of this work show a potential improvement over the results obtained solely through muon scattering due to the utilization of secondary particle information by applying this novel dual-channel cosmic-ray tomography analysis.</description>
