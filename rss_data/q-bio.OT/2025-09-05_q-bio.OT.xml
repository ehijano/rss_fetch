      <title>Analysis of the Metabolic Profile and Biological Activity of Hawthorn Species Twigs: Crataegus azarolus and Crataegus monogyna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All parts of the hawthorn tree (Crataegus spp.), including fruits, flowers, and leaves, have been used as a source of bioactive compounds. Thus, in this investigation, the twigs of two species of hawthorn plant of Crataegus azarolus (C. azarolus) and Crataegus monogyna (C. monogyna) were evaluated for bioactive compositions and biological activity (antioxidant and antimicrobial activities). To evaluate bioactive compositions, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was applied, and for biological activity, biochemical assays were performed. C. monogyna revealed a higher amount of total phenolic, total flavonoid, and total tannin contents compared to C. azarolus. The HPLC results indicated the highest amount of kaempferol (14.40%), catechin (17.70%), and gallic acid (25%) in twigs of C. azarolus, while the maximum quercetin (72%) compound was present in C. monogyna. C. monogyna exhibited higher antioxidant activity by 1,1 dizarophenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (86.13%) and 2,2 azino bis (3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid (ABTS) (92.93%) compared to C. azarolus for antioxidant activity DPPH (81.86%) and ABTS (87.47%) assay. In the case of antimicrobial activity, the twigs of both species (especially C. azarolus) have a capacity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The results of this study revealed that the twigs of both species contained a high amount of phenolic metabolites and antioxidant activity, while they showed low antimicrobial activity.</description>

      <title>How causal perspectives can inform neuroscience data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, considerable strides have been made in advancing neuroscientific techniques, yet challenges remain in attributing causality to observed associations. This review addresses a fundamental issue in observational neuroscience studies and advocates for incorporating causal inference frameworks into standard practice. We systematically introduce necessary definitions and concepts, emphasizing how causal assumptions underlie statistical analyses even when not explicitly stated. Through a running example on sleep quality and white matter integrity, we illustrate how persistent challenges, including confounding and selection biases, can be conceptualized and addressed using causal frameworks. We demonstrate practical approaches for making assumption violations transparent through hands-on examples: supplementary case studies using multi-site harmonization and head motion exclusion procedures provide step-by-step diagnostic techniques for checking covariate overlap and identifying selection bias through exclusion pattern analysis. We explore how these causal perspectives can inform both experimental design and analytical choices, particularly for observational studies where traditional randomization is infeasible. Together, we believe this framework offers concrete tools for strengthening causal interpretations and inspiring more robust approaches to problems in neuroscience.</description>
