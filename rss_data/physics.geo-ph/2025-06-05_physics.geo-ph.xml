      <title>Low-EFFourth: A computational framework for generating and studying multilevel model ensembles in low-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Low-EFFourth (LEF4), a MATLAB-based computational framework designed for generating and studying multilevel model ensembles in continuous dynamical systems. Initially developed to address questions in climate modelling, LEF4 can also be used in other disciplines such as epidemiology, economics, and engineering, with minimal modifications to the code. The framework provides an efficient and flexible approach for investigating uncertainties arising from initial conditions, model parameters, numerical methods, and model formulation. This preprint serves as a formal reference for the LEF4 codebase and provides a concise technical and conceptual overview of its purpose, structure, applications and development pipeline.</description>

      <title>Model for the Thermodynamics of Iron at High Pressures Near Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe pressure-temperature phase diagram and its melting line have a wide range of applications, including providing constraints for iron-core planetary models. We propose an equation of state (EOS) model based on the interstitial theory of simple condensed matter (ITCM), as suggested by A.V. Granato. When applied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines to the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes the solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong structural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like defects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the stabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded to describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than focusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the measured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a multiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to explain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line, resulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases, specifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids. This additional liquid phase offers a new interpretation of the previously suggested near-melting high-pressure phase and may also provide a solution to the inner core nucleation paradox.</description>

      <title>Geo-Disasters: geocoding climate-related events in the international disaster database EM-DAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate hazards can escalate into humanitarian disasters. Understanding their trajectories -- considering hazard intensity, human exposure, and societal vulnerability -- is essential for effective anticipatory action. The International Disaster Database (EM-DAT) is the only freely available global resource of humanitarian disaster records. However, it lacks exact geospatial information, limiting its use for climate hazard impact research. Here, we provide geocoding of 9,217 climate-related disasters reported by EM-DAT from 1990 to 2023, along with an open, reproducible framework for updating. Our method remains accurate even when only region names are available and includes quality flags to assess reliability. The augmented EM-DAT enables integration with other geocoded data, supporting more accurate assessment of climate disaster impacts and adaptation deficits.</description>

      <title>Determination of Effect of the Movement of a Finite, Dip-slip Fault in Viscoelastic Half-space of Fractional Burger Rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seismically active regions often correlate with fault lines, and the movement of these faults plays a crucial role in defining how stress is stored or released in these areas. To investigate the deformation and accumulation/release of stress and strain in seismically active regions during the aseismic period, a mathematical model has been developed by considering a finite, creeping dip-slip fault inclined in the viscoelastic half-space of a fractional Burger rheology. Laplace transformation for fractional derivatives, Modified Green's function technique, correspondence principle and finally, the inverse Laplace transformation have been used to derive analytical solutions for displacement, stress and strain components. The graphical representations were depicted using MATLAB to understand the effect on displacement, stresses and strains due to changes in inclinations and creep velocities of the fault, as well as orders of the fractional derivative. Our investigation indicates that a change in creep velocity and inclination of the fault has a significant effect, while a change in the order of fractional derivative has a moderate effect on displacement, stress, and strain components. Analysis of these results can provide insights into subsurface deformation and its impact on fault movement, which can lead to earthquakes.</description>

      <title>The QTF-Backbone: Proposal for a Nationwide Optical Fibre Backbone in Germany for Quantum Technology and Time and Frequency Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in the distribution of quantum information and high-precision time and frequency (T&amp;F) signals over long-haul optical fibre networks have transformative potential for physically secure communications, resilience of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and fundamental physics. However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&amp;F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions.
  We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&amp;F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&amp;D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment. As a national and European hub, it will position Germany and Europe at the forefront of quantum networking, as well as time and frequency transfer.</description>

      <title>A Resonant Beginning for the Solar System Terrestrial Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, transit surveys have revealed a class of planets with thick atmospheres -- sub-Neptunes -- that must have completed their accretion in protoplanet disks. When planets form in the gaseous disk, the gravitational interaction with the disk gas drives their migration and results in the trapping of neighboring planets in mean motion resonances, though these resonances can later be broken when the damping effects of disk gas or planetesimals wane. It is widely accepted that the outer Solar System gas giant planets originally formed in a resonant chain, which was later disrupted by dynamical instabilities. Here, we explore whether the early formation of the terrestrial planets in a resonance chain (including Theia) can evolve to the present configuration. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the giant planet instability would also have destabilized the terrestrial resonance chain, triggering moon-forming giant impacts in 20--50\% of our simulated systems, dependent on the initial resonance architecture. After the instability, the eccentricity and inclination of the simulated planets match their present-day values. Under the proposed scenario, the current period ratio of 3.05 between Mars and Venus -- devoid of any special significance in traditional late formation models -- naturally arises as a relic of the former resonance chain.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation and scattering in time dependent media: Lippmann-Schwinger equations, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems and Huygens' principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave scattering plays a central role for the modeling of complex wave propagation across all corners of science and engineering applications, including electromagnetic, acoustics, seismic and scattering physics. Wave control using time interfaces, where the properties of the medium through with the wave travels rapidly change in time, has opened further opportunities to control wave propagation in both space and time. For acoustic waves, studies on time modulated media have not been reported. In this context, full numerical solution of the wave equation using time interfaces is key to fully understand their potential. When applying time interfaces, the underlying physics of acoustic wave propagation and scattering and their similar roles on time and space, are still being explored. In this work, we introduce a mathematical formulation of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for acoustic wave scattering when time interfaces are induced via a change of the velocity of the medium. We demonstrate that space-time duality for acoustic wave propagation with time interfaces and derive the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for wave scattering in time-dependent media, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems. We experimentally verify our theoretical derivation by studying and measuring the acoustic wave scattering in strongly scattering media. We illustrate the proposed framework and present results of acoustic wave scattering without prior knowledge of the background wave-fields. This improves the understanding of the generation and wave scattering and opens previously inaccessible research directions, potentially facilitating practical applications for acoustic, geophysical and optical imaging.</description>
