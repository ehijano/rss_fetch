      <title>Social Media Bot Detection Research: Review of Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a review of research on social media bot detection. Social media bots are used by political and criminal actors for mass distribution of political messages, as well as rumors, conspiracy theories, and other forms of false information. Through the spread of disinformation, bots are eroding the public trust in political and media institutions and integrity of social media. We have examined recent research publication in the field of social media bot detection, including several previous reviews of bot detection research, and identified the methods used in bot detection and issues encountered by researchers. Our review was conducted through a search of 5 main bibliographical databases, which has produced a total of 534 research papers and other publications. This collection was then filtered with exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the most pertinent documents, resulting in a focused selection of 49 documents that were analyzed for this review. In the first part of the paper we introduce the phenomenon of fake news within social networks, its connection with social media bot activity, and conclude the introduction with issues caused or exacerbated by bots. In the main part of this paper we first present the results of statistical analysis of the reviewed documents and then introduce the field of social media bot research, followed by an overview of the issues of social media bot detection identified in the reviewed literature, including the evolution of bot concealment techniques and the methodological issues presented in some of the bot detection studies. We then proceed with an overview of the methods and results from the reviewed research papers, structured according to the main methodology used in the examined studies. Our review concludes with examination of the recent trends in social media bot development and related bot detection research.</description>

      <title>Prestigious but less interdisciplinary: a network analysis on top-rated journals in medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research, a process of knowledge integration, is vital for scientific advancements. It remains unclear whether prestigious journals that are highly impactful lead in disseminating interdisciplinary knowledge. In this paper, by constructing topic-level correlation networks based on publications, we evaluated the interdisciplinarity of more and less prestigious journals in medicine. We found research from prestigious medical journals tends to be less interdisciplinary than research from other medical journals. We also established that cancer-related research is the main driver of interdisciplinarity in medical science. Our results indicate a weak tendency for differences in topic correlations between more and less prestigious journals to be co-located. Accordingly, we identified that interdisciplinarity in prestigious journals mainly differs from interdisciplinarity in other journals in areas such as infections, nervous system diseases and cancer. Overall, our results suggest that interdisciplinarity in science could benefit from prestigious journals easing rigid disciplinary boundaries.</description>

      <title>La perversidad inducida</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The title of this essay, Induced perversity, La perversidad inducida (in Spanish), refers to the side effects of sharing information on social media when it turns out to be false; or when judgments are made about people, events, companies, or facts that can produce effects often leading to consequences that were not initially foreseen. In digital environments, on the internet of linked data, harrassment politics and the cancellation culture are not isolated phenomena; they should be related to the evolution of the web, the emergence of the platform-driven economy, and the change of users' behaviour. Risks are not only a product of technology or the emergence of artificial intelligence. Ethical problems arise in a hybrid society, where the adaptation of human behavior to human-machine interaction (HMI), and the ethical, social, and legal ways of regulating them have yet to be learned. This contribution complements the contents of the article: La regimentacion tecnologica. Inteligencia artificial, fascismo, agresionn y sociedad democratica. TeKnoKultura.

      <title>GNN-Based Candidate Node Predictor for Influence Maximization in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an age where information spreads rapidly across social media, effectively identifying influential nodes in dynamic networks is critical. Traditional influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where understanding temporal dynamics is crucial.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Trust in Inter-Organisational Data Sharing: Levels of Assurance for Data Trustworthiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data is increasingly acknowledged as a highly valuable asset, much effort has been put into investigating inter-organisational data sharing, aiming at utilising the value of formerly unused data. Moreover, most researchers agree, that trust between actors is key for successful data sharing activities. However, existing research oftentimes focus on trust from a data provider perspective. Therefore, our work highlights the unbalanced view of trust, addressing it from a data consumer perspective. More specifically, our aim is to investigate trust enhancing measures on a data level, that is data trustworthiness. We found, that existing data trustworthiness enhancing solutions do not meet the requirements of the domain of inter-organisational data sharing. Therefore, our study addresses this gap. Conducting a rigorous design science research approach, this work proposes a new Levels of Assurance for Data Trustworthiness artifact. Built on existing artifacts, we demonstrate, how it addresses the identified challenges within the domain appropriately. We found that our novel approach requires more work to be suitable for adoption. Still, we are confident that our solution can increase consumer trust. We conclude by contributing to the body of design knowledge and emphasise the need for more attention to be put into consumer trust.</description>

      <title>A QUBO Framework for Team Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</description>

      <title>Mapping the changing structure of science through diachronic periodical embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the changing structure of science over time is essential to elucidating how science evolves. We develop diachronic embeddings of scholarly periodicals to quantify "semantic changes" of periodicals across decades, allowing us to track the evolution of research topics and identify rapidly developing fields. By mapping periodicals within a physical-life-health triangle, we reveal an evolving interdisciplinary science landscape, finding an overall trend toward specialization for most periodicals but increasing interdisciplinarity for bioscience periodicals. Analyzing a periodical's trajectory within this triangle over time allows us to visualize how its research focus shifts. Furthermore, by monitoring the formation of local clusters of periodicals, we can identify emerging research topics such as AIDS research and nanotechnology in the 1980s. Our work offers novel quantification in the science of science and provides a quantitative lens to examine the evolution of science, which may facilitate future investigations into the emergence and development of research fields.</description>

      <title>Short-video Propagation Influence Rating: A New Real-world Dataset and A New Large Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.</description>

      <title>Did ChatGPT or Copilot use alter the style of internet news headlines? A time series regression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23811v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The release of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Copilot is changing the way text is created and may influence the content that we find on the web. This study investigated whether the release of these two popular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on worldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a dataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was applied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any statistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT and/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have any significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total of 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot although significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3, Gopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these language models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news headlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1407.2515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncovering unknown or missing links in social networks is a difficult task because of their sparsity and because links may represent different types of relationships, characterized by different structural patterns. In this paper, we define a simple yet efficient supervised learning-to-rank framework, called RankMerging, which aims at combining information provided by various unsupervised rankings. We illustrate our method on three different kinds of social networks and show that it substantially improves the performances of unsupervised metrics of ranking. We also compare it to other combination strategies based on standard methods. Finally, we explore various aspects of RankMerging, such as feature selection and parameter estimation and discuss its area of relevance: the prediction of an adjustable number of links on large networks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Reputation Computation Ontology and Temporal Graph Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of reliable democratic governance is important for survival of any community, and it will be more critical over time communities with levels of social connectivity in society rapidly increasing with speeds and scales of electronic communication. In order to face such challenge, different sorts of rating and reputation systems are being developed, however reputation gaming and manipulation in such systems appears to be serious problem. We are considering use of advanced reputation system supporting "liquid democracy" principle with generalized design and underlying ontology fitting different sorts of environments such as social networks, financial ecosystems and marketplaces. The suggested system is based on "temporal weighted liquid rank" algorithm employing different sorts of explicit and implicit ratings being exchanged by members of the society. For the purpose, we suggest "incremental reputation" design and graph database used for implementation of the system. Finally, we present evaluation of the system against real social network and financial blockchain data. The entire framework is expected to be the foundation of any multi-agent AI framework, so the evolution of distributed multi-agent AI architecture and dynamics will be based on the organic reputation scores earned by the agents that are part of it.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Interdependent Emotion Dynamics in Online Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing share of human interactions now occurs online, where the expression and perception of emotions are often amplified and distorted. Yet, the interplay between different emotions and the extent to which they are driven by external stimuli or social feedback remains poorly understood. We calibrate a multivariate Hawkes self-exciting point process to model the temporal expression of six basic emotions in YouTube Live chats. This framework captures both temporal and cross-emotional dependencies while allowing us to disentangle the influence of video content (exogenous) from peer interactions (endogenous). We find that emotional expressions are up to four times more strongly driven by peer interaction than by video content. Positivity is more contagious, spreading three times more readily, whereas negativity is more memorable, lingering nearly twice as long. Moreover, we observe asymmetric cross-excitation, with negative emotions frequently triggering positive ones, a pattern consistent with trolling dynamics, but not the reverse. These findings highlight the central role of social interaction in shaping emotional dynamics online and the risks of emotional manipulation as human-chatbot interactions become increasingly realistic.</description>

      <title>Exposing Cross-Platform Coordinated Inauthentic Activity in the Run-Up to the 2024 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinated information operations remain a persistent challenge on social media, despite platform efforts to curb them. While previous research has primarily focused on identifying these operations within individual platforms, this study shows that coordination frequently transcends platform boundaries. Leveraging newly collected data of online conversations related to the 2024 U.S. Election across $\mathbb{X}$ (formerly, Twitter), Facebook, and Telegram, we construct similarity networks to detect coordinated communities exhibiting suspicious sharing behaviors within and across platforms. Proposing an advanced coordination detection model, we reveal evidence of potential foreign interference, with Russian-affiliated media being systematically promoted across Telegram and $\mathbb{X}$. Our analysis also uncovers substantial intra- and cross-platform coordinated inauthentic activity, driving the spread of highly partisan, low-credibility, and conspiratorial content. These findings highlight the urgent need for regulatory measures that extend beyond individual platforms to effectively address the growing challenge of cross-platform coordinated influence campaigns.</description>

      <title>TouchUp-G: Improving Feature Representation through Graph-Centric Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we enhance the node features acquired from Pretrained Models (PMs) to better suit downstream graph learning tasks? Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</description>

      <title>Network-based diversification of stock and cryptocurrency portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11739</link>

Abstract: Maintaining a balance between returns and volatility is a common strategy for portfolio diversification, whether investing in traditional equities or digital assets like cryptocurrencies. One approach for diversification is the application of community detection or clustering, using a network representing the relationships between assets. We examine two network representations, one based on a standard distance matrix based on correlation, and another based on mutual information. The Louvain and Affinity propagation algorithms were employed for finding the network communities (clusters) based on annual data. Furthermore, we examine building assets' co-occurrence networks, where communities are detected for each month throughout a whole year and then the links represent how often assets belong to the same community. Portfolios are then constructed by selecting several assets from each community based on local properties (degree centrality), global properties (closeness centrality), or explained variance (Principal component analysis), with three value ranges (max, med, min), calculated on a maximal spanning tree or a fully connected community sub-graph. We explored these various strategies on data from the S\&amp;P 500 and the Top 203 cryptocurrencies with a market cap above 2M USD in the period from Jan 2019 to Sep 2022. Moreover, we study into more details the periods of the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak and the start of the war in Ukraine. The results confirm some of the previous findings already known for traditional stock markets and provide some further insights, while they reveal an opposing trend in the crypto-assets market.</description>

      <title>A City of Millions: Mapping Literary Social Networks At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We release 70,509 high-quality social networks extracted from multilingual fiction and nonfiction narratives. We additionally provide metadata for $\sim$30,000 of these texts (73\% nonfiction and 27\% fiction) written between 1800 and 1999 in 58 languages. This dataset provides information on historical social worlds at an unprecedented scale, including data for 2,510,021 individuals in 2,805,482 pair-wise relationships annotated for affinity and relationship type. We achieve this scale by automating previously manual methods of extracting social networks; specifically, we adapt an existing annotation task as a language model prompt, ensuring consistency at scale with the use of structured output. This dataset serves as a unique resource for humanities and social science research by providing data on cognitive models of social realities.</description>
