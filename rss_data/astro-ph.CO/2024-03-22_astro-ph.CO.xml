      <title>Testing Tachyon-Dominated Cosmology with Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open or hyperbolic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime dominated by tachyonic dark matter can exhibit an ``inflected'' expansion -- initially decelerating, later accelerating -- similar but not identical to that of now-standard $\Lambda$CDM models dominated by dark energy. The features of the tachyonic model can be extracted by fitting the redshift-distance relation of the model to data obtained by treating Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. Here such a model is fitted to samples of 186 and 1048 Type Ia supernovae from the literature. The fits yield values of $H_0=(66.6\pm1.5)~\hbox{km/s/Mpc}$ and $H_0=(69.6\pm0.4)~\hbox{km/s/Mpc}$, respectively, for the current-time Hubble parameter, and $t_0=(8.35\pm0.68)~\hbox{Gyr}$ and $t_0=(8.15\pm0.36)~\hbox{Gyr}$, respectively, for the comoving-time age of the Universe. Tests of the model against other observations will be undertaken in subsequent works.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Substructure Mass Power Spectrum of 23 SLACS Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can be used as a tool for constraining the substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies. In this study we investigate the power spectrum of dark matter perturbations in a population of 23 Hubble Space Telescope images of strong galaxy-galaxy lenses selected from The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We model the dark matter substructure as a Gaussian Random Field perturbation on a smooth lens mass potential, characterized by power-law statistics. We expand upon the previously developed machine learning framework to predict the power-law statistics by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accounts for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. For the training sets, we use the smooth lens mass potentials and reconstructed source galaxies that have been previously modelled through traditional fits of analytical and shapelet profiles as a starting point. We train three CNNs with different training set: the first using standard data augmentation on the best-fitting reconstructed sources, the second using different reconstructed sources spaced throughout the posterior distribution, and the third using a combination of the two data sets. We apply the trained CNNs to the SLACS data and find agreement in their predictions. Our results suggest a significant substructure perturbation favoring a high frequency power spectrum across our lens population.</description>

      <title>The DEHVILS in the Details: Type Ia Supernova Hubble Residual Comparisons and Mass Step Analysis in the Near-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) have been used both as an alternate path to cosmology compared to optical measurements and as a method of constraining key systematics for the larger optical studies. With the DEHVILS sample, the largest published NIR sample with consistent NIR coverage of maximum light across three NIR bands ($Y$, $J$, and $H$), we check three key systematics: (i) the reduction in Hubble residual scatter as compared to the optical, (ii) the measurement of a "mass step" or lack thereof and its implications, and (iii) the ability to distinguish between various dust models by analyzing correlations between Hubble residuals in the NIR and optical. We produce accurate simulations of the DEHVILS sample and find, contrary to assumptions in the literature, it is $\textit{harder}$ to differentiate between various dust models than previously understood. Additionally, we find that fitting with the current SALT3 model does not yield accurate wavelength-dependent stretch-luminosity correlations, and we propose a limited solution for this problem. From the data, we see that (i) the standard deviation of Hubble residual values from NIR bands treated as standard candles are 0.007-0.042 mag smaller than those in the optical, (ii) the NIR mass step is not constrainable with the current sample size from DEHVILS, and (iii) Hubble residuals in the NIR and optical are correlated in both the simulations and the data. We test a few variations on the number and combinations of filters and data samples, and we observe that none of our findings or conclusions are significantly impacted by these modifications.</description>

      <title>PINNferring the Hubble Function with Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble function characterizes a given Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime and can be related to the densities of the cosmological fluids and their equations of state. We show how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) emulate this dynamical system and provide fast predictions of the luminosity distance for a given choice of densities and equations of state, as needed for the analysis of supernova data. We use this emulator to perform a model-independent and parameter-free reconstruction of the Hubble function on the basis of supernova data. As part of this study, we develop and validate an uncertainty treatment for PINNs using a heteroscedastic loss and repulsive ensembles.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: a Fisher Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology naturally addresses the multi-scale topological characteristics of the large-scale structure as a distribution of clusters, loops, and voids. We apply this tool to the dark matter halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13-50%. The complementarity of the two statistics breaks parameter degeneracies, allowing for a further gain in constraining power when combined. We run a series of consistency checks to consolidate our results, and conclude that our findings motivate incorporating persistent homology into inference pipelines for cosmological survey data.</description>

      <title>Inferring astrophysical parameters using the 2D cylindrical power spectrum from reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enlightening our understanding of the first galaxies responsible for driving reionisation requires detecting the 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen. Interpreting the wealth of information embedded in this signal requires Bayesian inference. Parameter inference from the 21-cm signal is primarily restricted to the spherically averaged power spectrum (1D PS) owing to its relatively straightforward derivation of an analytic likelihood function enabling traditional Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain (MCMC) approaches. However, in recent years, simulation-based inference (SBI) has become feasible which removes the necessity of having an analytic likelihood, enabling more complex summary statistics of the 21-cm signal to be used for Bayesian inference. In this work, we use SBI, specifically marginal neural ratio estimation to learn the likelihood-to-evidence ratio with Swyft, to explore parameter inference using the cylindrically averaged 2D PS. Since the 21-cm signal is anisotropic, the 2D PS should yield more constraining information compared to the 1D PS which isotropically averages the signal. For this, we consider a mock 1000 hr observation of the 21-cm signal using the SKA and compare the performance of the 2D PS relative to the 1D PS. Additionally, we explore two separate foreground mitigation strategies, perfect foreground removal and wedge avoidance. We find the 2D PS outperforms the 1D PS by improving the marginalised uncertainties on individual astrophysical parameters by up to $\sim30-40$ per cent irrespective of the foreground mitigation strategy. Primarily, these improvements stem from how the 2D PS distinguishes between the transverse, $k_{\perp}$, and redshift dependent, $k_{\parallel}$ information which enables greater sensitivity to the complex reionisation morphology.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of the halo mass function for inferring astrophysical parameters during reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the 21-cm signal at $z\gtrsim6$ will reveal insights into the properties of the first galaxies responsible for driving reionisation. To extract this information, we perform parameter inference which requires embedding 3D simulations of the 21-cm signal within a Bayesian inference pipeline. Presently, when performing inference we must choose which sources of uncertainty to sample and which to hold fixed. Since the astrophysics of galaxies are much more uncertain than those of the underlying halo-mass function (HMF), we usually parameterise and model the former while fixing the latter. However, in doing so we may bias our inference of the properties of these first galaxies. In this work, we explore the consequences of assuming an incorrect choice of HMF and quantify the relative biases in our inferred astrophysical model parameters when considering the wrong HMF. We then relax this assumption by constructing a generalised five parameter model for the HMF and simultaneously recover these parameters along with our underlying astrophysical model. For this analysis, we use 21cmFAST and perform Simulation-Based Inference by applying marginal neural ratio estimation to learn the likelihood-to-evidence ratio using Swyft. Using a mock 1000 hour observation of the 21-cm power spectrum from the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array, conservatively assuming foreground wedge avoidance, we find assuming the incorrect HMF can bias the recovered astrophysical parameters by up to $\sim3-4\sigma$ even when including independent information from observed luminosity functions. When considering our generalised HMF model, we recover constraints on our astrophysical parameters with a factor of $\sim2-4$ larger marginalised uncertainties. Importantly, these constraints are unbiased, agnostic to the underlying HMF and therefore more conservative.</description>

      <title>Improving SDSS Cosmological Constraints through $\beta$-Skeleton Weighted Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\beta$-skeleton approach can be conveniently utilized to construct the cosmic web based on the spatial geometry distribution of galaxies, particularly in sparse samples. This method plays a key role in establishing the three-dimensional structure of the Universe and serves as a tool for quantitatively characterizing the nature of the cosmic web. This study is the first application of $\beta$-skeleton information as weights in mark weighted correlation functions (MCFs), presenting a novel statistical measure. We have applied the $\beta$-skeleton approach to the CMASS NGC galaxy samples from SDSS BOSS DR12 in the redshift interval $0.45 \leq z \leq 0.55$. Additionally, we applied this approach to three COLA cosmological simulations with different settings ($\Omega_m=0.25, \Omega_m=0.31, \Omega_m=0.4$) for comparison. We measured three MCFs, each weighted by: i) the number of neighboring galaxies around each galaxy; ii) the average distance of each galaxy from its surrounding neighbors; iii) the reciprocal of the average distance of each galaxy from its surrounding neighbors. By comparing measurements and calculating corresponding $\chi^2$ statistics, we observe high sensitivity to the cosmological parameter $\Omega_m$ through a joint analysis of the two-point correlation and three MCFs.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive data-driven odyssey to explore the equation of state of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the dark energy equation of the state parameter without tying ourselves to any specific cosmological model or parametrization except spatial homogeneity, isotropy, and flatness leading to a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Instead, we rely on actual observational data to guide our analysis. This is the first study in which we combine the cosmological background and the growth observations to reconstruct the equation of the state parameter of dark energy independent of the present values of the matter-energy density parameter and Hubble parameter. We use information about the Hubble parameter from cosmic chronometer data and the growth rate from observations related to growth rates. Our method involves a posterior approach of Gaussian process regression analysis to figure out the Hubble parameter and growth rate, plus their changes with redshift. The significant shift of paradigm in this study lies in the independence of the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state from any prior knowledge of the present Hubble parameter and matter energy density parameter. We find a slight hint of dynamical behavior in dark energy. However, the evidence is not significant. We also find a leaning towards non-phantom behavior over phantom behavior. Intriguingly, we observe that the $\Lambda$CDM model nearly touches the lower boundary of the 1$\sigma$ confidence region for the reconstructed dark energy equation of state parameter in the redshift range $0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$. However, it comfortably resides within the 1$\sigma$ confidence region in the redshift range under investigation, $0\leq z \leq 1.5$. Consequently, the non-parametric, model-independent reconstruction of dark energy provides no compelling evidence to deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering cosmic chronometer and growth rate observations.</description>

      <title>Hint of a long-range dark sector fifth force in the current cosmological data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial Black Holes and Dark Matter Clumps in the Solar System with Gravimeter and GNSS Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and gravimeters on Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system, including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition, our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force beyond gravity.</description>

      <title>No time to derive: unraveling total time derivatives in in-in perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions, incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations, and we provide diagrammatic rules to systematically classify all possible contributions. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation [...]. Being already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear dynamics of quantum states during inflation.</description>

      <title>Tomographic redshift dipole: Testing the cosmological principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological principle posits that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, implying all matter share the same rest frame. This principle suggests that velocity estimates of our motion from various sources should agree with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole's inferred velocity of 370 km/s. Yet, for over two decades, analyses of different radio galaxy and quasar catalogs have reported velocities with amplitudes in notable tension with the CMB dipole. In a blind analysis of BOSS and eBOSS spectroscopic data from galaxies and quasars across $0.2&lt;z&lt;2.2$, we applied a novel dipole estimator for a tomographic approach, robustly correcting biases and quantifying uncertainties with state-of-the-art mock catalogs. Our results, indicating a velocity of $v = 353^{+123}_{-111}$ km/s, closely align with the CMB dipole, demonstrating a $1.4\sigma$ agreement. This finding provides significant empirical support for the cosmological principle, affirming our motion's consistency with the CMB across vast cosmic distances.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from CD-EoR with REACH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization carries invaluable information about the cosmology and astrophysics of the early Universe. Analyzing the data from a sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment typically involves navigating through an intricate parameter space to accurately address various factors such as foregrounds, beam uncertainties, ionospheric distortions, and receiver noise for the search of the cosmological 21-cm signal. The traditional likelihood-based sampling methods for modeling these effects could become computationally demanding for such highly complex models, which makes it infeasible to include physically motivated 21-cm signal models in the analysis. Moreover, the inference with these traditional methods is driven by the assumed functional form of the likelihood function. This work demonstrates how Simulation-Based Inference through Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) can naturally handle these issues at a significantly reduced computational cost than the likelihood-based methods. We estimate the posterior distribution on our model parameters with TMNRE for simulated mock observations, composed of beam-weighted foregrounds, physically motivated 21-cm signal, and radiometric noise. We find that maximizing the information content by simultaneously analyzing the data from multiple time slices and antennas significantly improves the parameter constraints and leads to a better exploration of the cosmological signal. We discuss the application of TMNRE for the current configuration of the REACH experiment and demonstrate how it can be utilized to explore potential avenues for REACH. The method presented here can be easily generalized for any sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment.</description>

      <title>Lower tensor-to-scalar ratio as possible signature of modified gravity</title>

Abstract: This paper simplifies the induced four-dimensional gravitational equations originating from a five-dimensional bulk within the framework of Nash's embeddings, incorporating them into a well-known $\mu-\Sigma$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization. By leveraging data from Planck Public Release 4 (PR4), BICEP/Keck Array 2018, Planck cosmic microwave background lensing, and baryon acoustic oscillation observations, we establish a stringent lower limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio parameter: $r &lt; 0.0303$ at a confidence level (CL) of 95\%. This finding suggests the presence of extrinsic dynamics influencing standard four-dimensional cosmology. Notably, this limit surpasses those typically obtained through Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which yield $r&lt;0.038$, or through the frequentist profile likelihood method, which yields $r&lt;0.037$ at 95\% CL.</description>

      <title>Probing minihalo lenses with diffracted gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: When gravitational waves pass near a gravitating object, they are deflected, or lensed. If the object is massive, such that the wavelength of the waves is small compared to its gravitational size, lensed gravitational wave events can be identified when multiple signals are detected at different times. However, when the wavelength is long, wave-optics diffraction effects will be important, and a lensed event can be identified by looking for frequency-dependent modulations to the gravitational waveform, without having to associate multiple signals. For current ground-based gravitational wave detectors observing stellar-mass binary compact object mergers, wave-optics effects are important for lenses with masses $\lesssim 1000 M_{\odot}$. Therefore, minihalos below this mass range could potentially be identified by lensing diffraction. The challenge with analyzing these events is that the frequency-dependent lensing modulation, or the amplification factor, is prohibitively expensive to compute for Bayesian parameter inference. In this work, we use a novel time-domain method to construct interpolators of the amplification factor for the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), generalized singular isothermal sphere (gSIS) and cored isothermal sphere (CIS) lens models. Using these interpolators, we perform Bayesian inference on gravitational-wave signals lensed by minihalos injected in mock detector noise, assuming current sensitivity of ground-based detectors. We find that we could potentially identify an event when it is lensed by minihalos and extract the values of all lens parameters in addition to the parameters of the GW source. All of the methods are implemented in Glworia, the accompanying open-source Python package, and can be generalized to study lensed signals detected by current and next-generation detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle decays are always accompanied by the emission of graviton quanta of gravity through bremsstrahlung processes. However, the corresponding branching ratio is suppressed by the square of the ratio of particle's mass to the Planck scale. The resulting present abundance of gravitational waves (GWs), composed of gravitons, is analogously suppressed. We show that superheavy particles, as heavy as the Planck scale, can be naturally produced during the post-inflationary reheating stage in the early Universe and their decays yield dramatic amounts of GWs over broad frequency range. GW observations could hence directly probe Planck-scale physics, notoriously challenging to explore.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gravitational Waves: A New Window to Look for Heavy Non-annihilating Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sun-like stars can transmute into comparable mass black holes by steadily accumulating heavy non-annihilating dark matter particles over the course of their lives. If such stars form in binary systems, they could give rise to quasi-monochromatic, persistent gravitational waves, commonly known as continuous gravitational waves, as they inspiral towards one another. We demonstrate that next-generation space-based detectors, e.g., Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can provide novel constraints on dark matter parameters (dark matter mass and its interaction cross-section with the nucleons) by probing gravitational waves from transmuted Sun-like stars that are in close binaries. Our projected constraints depend on several astrophysical uncertainties, nevertheless, are competitive with the existing constraints obtained from cosmological measurements as well as terrestrial direct searches, demonstrating a notable science-case for these space-based gravitational wave detectors as probes of particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>RG-CAT: Detection Pipeline and Catalogue of Radio Galaxies in the EMU Pilot Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present source detection and catalogue construction pipelines to build the first catalogue of radio galaxies from the 270 $\rm deg^2$ pilot survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU-PS) conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The detection pipeline uses Gal-DINO computer-vision networks (Gupta et al., 2024) to predict the categories of radio morphology and bounding boxes for radio sources, as well as their potential infrared host positions. The Gal-DINO network is trained and evaluated on approximately 5,000 visually inspected radio galaxies and their infrared hosts, encompassing both compact and extended radio morphologies. We find that the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes is larger than 0.5 for 99% of the radio sources, and 98% of predicted host positions are within $3^{\prime \prime}$ of the ground truth infrared host in the evaluation set. The catalogue construction pipeline uses the predictions of the trained network on the radio and infrared image cutouts based on the catalogue of radio components identified using the Selavy source finder algorithm. Confidence scores of the predictions are then used to prioritize Selavy components with higher scores and incorporate them first into the catalogue. This results in identifications for a total of 211,625 radio sources, with 201,211 classified as compact and unresolved. The remaining 10,414 are categorized as extended radio morphologies, including 582 FR-I, 5,602 FR-II, 1,494 FR-x (uncertain whether FR-I or FR-II), 2,375 R (single-peak resolved) radio galaxies, and 361 with peculiar and other rare morphologies. We cross-match the radio sources in the catalogue with the infrared and optical catalogues, finding infrared cross-matches for 73% and photometric redshifts for 36% of the radio galaxies.</description>

      <title>Probing modified Hawking evaporation with gravitational waves from the primordial black hole dominated universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that Hawking evaporation might slow down after a black hole has lost about half of its mass. Such an effect, called "memory burden", is parameterized as a suppression in the mass loss rate by negative powers $n$ of the black hole entropy and could considerably extend the lifetime of a black hole. We study the impact of memory burden on the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario. Modified PBH evaporation leads to a significantly longer PBH dominated stage. Requiring that PBHs evaporate prior enough to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis shrinks the allowed PBH mass range. Indeed, we find that for $n&gt;2.5$ the PBH reheating scenario is not viable. The frequency of the Gravitational Waves (GWs) induced by PBH number density fluctuations is bound to be larger than about a Hz, while the amplitude of the GW spectrum is enhanced due to the longer PBH dominated phase. Interestingly, we show that, in some models, the slope of the induced GW spectrum might be sensitive to the modifications to Hawking evaporation, proving it may be possible to test the "memory burden" effect via induced GWs. Lastly, we argue that our results could also apply to general modifications of Hawking evaporation.</description>

Abstract: The imprint of interacting dark energy (IDE) needs to be correctly identified in order to avoid bias in constraints on IDE. This paper investigates the large-scale imprint of IDE in redshift space distortions, using $Euclid$-like photometric prescriptions. A first attempt at incorporating the IDE dynamics in the galaxy (clustering and evolution) biases is made. Without IDE dynamics taken into account in the galaxy biases, as is conventionally done, the results suggest that for a constant dark energy equation of state parameter, an IDE model where the dark energy transfer rate is proportional to the dark energy density exhibits an alternating, positive-negative effect in the redshift space distortions angular power spectrum. However, when the IDE dynamics is incorporated in the galaxy biases, it is found that the apparent positive-negative alternating effect vanishes: implying that neglecting IDE dynamics in the galaxy biases can result in ''artefacts'' that can lead to incorrect identification of the IDE imprint. In general, the results show that multi-tracer analysis will be needed to beat down cosmic variance in order for the redshift space distortions angular power spectrum as a statistic to be a viable diagnostic of IDE. Moreover, it is found that redshift space distortions hold the potential to constrain IDE on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; with the scenario having IDE dynamics incorporated in the biases showing better potential.</description>

      <title>EDGES of the dark forest: A new absorption window into the composite dark matter and large scale structure</title>

Abstract: We propose a new method to hunt for dark matter using dark forest/absorption features across the whole electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays, especially in the bands where there is a desert i.e. regions where no strong lines from baryons are expected. Such novel signatures can arise for dark matter models with a composite nature and internal electromagnetic transitions. The photons from a background source can interact with the dark matter resulting in an absorption signal in the source spectrum. In the case of a compact source, such as a quasar, such interactions in the dark matter halos can produce a series of closely spaced absorption lines, which we call the dark forest. We show that the dark forest feature is a sensitive probe of the dark matter self-interactions and the halo mass function, especially at the low mass end. There is a large volume of parameter space where dark forest is more sensitive compared to the best current and proposed direct detection experiments. Moreover, the absorption of CMB photons by dark matter gives rise to a global absorption signal in the CMB spectrum. For dark matter transition energies in the range $2.5\times 10^{-4}$ eV$-$ $5\times 10^{3}$ eV, such absorption features result in spectral distortions of the CMB in the COBE/FIRAS band of 60-600 GHz. If the dark matter transition frequency is $\sim$156 GHz, we show that the absorption of CMB photons by dark matter can provide an explanation for the anomalous absorption feature detected by the EDGES collaboration in 50-100 MHz range.</description>

      <title>Negative Dark Energy Density from High Redshift Pantheon+ Supernovae</title>

Abstract: Within the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework, the Hubble constant $H_0$ is an integration constant. Thus, consistency of the model demands observational constancy of $H_0$. We demonstrate redshift evolution of best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters $(H_0, \Omega_{m})$ in Pantheon+ supernove (SNe). Redshift evolution of best fit cosmological parameters is a prerequisite to finding a statistically significant evolution as well as identifying alternative models that are competitive with $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. To assess statistical significance, we employ three different methods: i) Bayesian model comparison, ii) mock simulations and iii) profile distributions. The first shows a marginal preference for the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model over an ad hoc model with 3 additional parameters and an unphysical jump in cosmological parameters at $z=1$. From mock simulations, we estimate the statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters and negative dark energy density ($\Omega_m &gt; 1$) to be in the $1-2 \sigma$ range, depending on the criteria employed. Importantly, in direct comparison to the same analysis with the earlier Pantheon sample we find that statistical significance of redshift evolution of best fit parameters has increased, as expected for a physical effect. Our profile distribution analysis demonstrates a shift in $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ in excess of $95\%$ confidence level for SNe with redshifts $z &gt; 1$ and also shows that a degeneracy in MCMC posteriors is not equivalent to a curve of constant $\chi^2$. Our findings can be interpreted as a statistical fluctuation or unexplored systematics in Pantheon+ or $\Lambda$CDM model breakdown. The first two possibilities are disfavoured by similar trends in independent probes.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Dark Matter and Secondary Gravitational Waves from Warm Higgs-G Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of dissipative effects during warm inflation leading to the small-scale enhancement of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations. In this paper, we specifically focus on non-canonical warm inflationary scenarios and study a model of warm Higgs-G inflation, in which the Standard Model Higgs boson drives inflation, with a Galileon-like non-linear kinetic term. We show that in the Galileon-dominated regime, the primordial power spectrum is strongly enhanced, leading to the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) with a wide range of the mass spectrum. Interestingly, PBHs in the asteroid mass window $\sim (10^{17}$ -- $10^{23}$) g are generated in this model, which can explain the total abundance of the dark matter in the Universe. In our analysis, we also calculate the secondary gravitational waves (GW) sourced by these small-scale overdense fluctuations and find that the induced GW spectrum can be detected in the future GW detectors, such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc. Our scenario thus provides a novel way of generating PBHs as dark matter and a detectable stochastic GW background from warm inflation. We also show that our scenario is consistent with the swampland and the trans-Planckian censorship conjectures and, thus, remains in the viable landscape of UV complete theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the Starobinsky model of inflation. We derive solutions for various cosmological observables, such as the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and their runnings, as well as the number of $e$-folds of inflation, reheating, and radiation with minimal assumptions. We establish an equation that connects inflation and reheating, which can be solved for the spectral index $n_s$. Using consistency relations of the model, we determine the other observables, the number of $e$-folds during inflation $N_k$, and the number of $e$-folds during reheating $N_{re}$. The impact of reheating on inflation is explored by constraining the equation of state parameter $\omega_{re}$ at the end of reheating. We find remarkable agreement between the Starobinsky model and current measurements of the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations and the present bounds on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological simulations serve as invaluable tools for understanding the Universe. However, the technical complexity and substantial computational resources required to generate such simulations often limit their accessibility within the broader research community. Notable exceptions exist, but most are not suited for simultaneously studying the physics of galaxy formation and cosmic reionization during the first billion years of cosmic history. This is especially relevant now that a fleet of advanced observatories (e.g. James Webb Space Telescope, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, ELT, SKA) will soon provide an holistic picture of this defining epoch. To bridge this gap, we publicly release all simulation outputs and post-processing products generated within the THESAN simulation project at https://thesan-project.com. This project focuses on the $z \geq 5.5$ Universe, combining a radiation-hydrodynamics solver (AREPO-RT), a well-tested galaxy formation model (IllustrisTNG) and cosmic dust physics to provide a comprehensive view of the Epoch of Reionization. The THESAN suite includes 16 distinct simulations, each varying in volume, resolution, and underlying physical models. This paper outlines the unique features of these new simulations, the production and detailed format of the wide range of derived data products, and the process for data retrieval. Finally, as a case study, we compare our simulation data with a number of recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, affirming the accuracy and applicability of THESAN. The examples also serve as prototypes for how to utilise the released dataset to perform comparisons between predictions and observations.</description>

Abstract: Current observations do not rule out the possibility that the Universe might end up in an abrupt event. Different such scenarios may be explored through suitable parameterizations of the dark energy and then confronted to cosmological background data. Here we parameterize a pseudorip scenario using a particular sigmoid function and carry an in-depth multifaceted examination of its evolutionary features and statistical performance. This depiction of a non violent final fate of our cosmos seems to be arguably statistically favoured over the consensus {\Lambda}CDM model according to some Bayesian discriminators.</description>

Therefore, it is essential to have a firm theoretical basis that allows the effective analysis of the data. With this purpose, we compute the nonlinear, gravitationally-induced connected galaxy 4-point correlation function (4PCF) at the tree level in Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT), including redshift-space distortions (RSD). We begin from the trispectrum and take its inverse Fourier transform into configuration space, exploiting the isotropic basis functions of Cahn &amp; Slepian (2023). We ultimately reduce the configuration-space expression to low-dimensional radial integrals of the power spectrum. This model will enable the use of the BAO feature in the connected 4PCF to sharpen our constraints on the expansion history of the Universe. It will also offer an additional avenue for determining the galaxy bias parameters, and thus tighten our cosmological constraints by breaking degeneracies. Survey geometry can be corrected in the 4PCF, and many systematics are localized, which is an advantage over data analysis with the trispectrum. Finally, this work is a first step in using the parity-even 4PCF to calibrate out any possible systematics in the parity-odd 4PCF; comparing our model to the measurement will offer a consistency test that can serve as a "canary in the coal mine" for systematics in the odd sector.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Horndeski Gravity under Positivity Bounds</title>

Abstract: A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into $\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation $\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Recycled Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: We outline a new production mechanism for dark matter that we dub "recycling": dark sector particles are kinematically trapped in the false vacuum during a dark phase transition; the false pockets collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs), which ultimately evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) to reproduce the dark sector particles. The requirement that all PBHs evaporate prior to BBN necessitates high scale phase transitions and hence high scale masses for the dark sector particles in the true vacuum. Our mechanism is therefore particularly suited for the production of ultra heavy dark matter (UHDM) with masses above $\sim 10^{12}\,{\rm GeV}$. The correct relic density of UHDM is obtained because of the exponential suppression of the false pocket number density. Recycled UHDM has several novel features: the dark sector today consists of multiple decoupled species that were once in thermal equilibrium and the PBH formation stage has extended mass functions whose shape can be controlled by IR operators coupling the dark and visible sectors.</description>
