      <title>EDEN: Exploring Disks Embedded in N-body simulations of Milky-Way-mass halos from Symphony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of galactic disks on the tidal stripping of cold dark matter subhalos within Milky Way (MW)-mass halos ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 10^{12}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) using a new simulation suite, EDEN. By re-simulating 45 MW-mass zoom-in halos from the N-body Symphony compilation with embedded disk potentials, which evolve according to star formation histories predicted by the UniverseMachine model, we self-consistently tie disk growth to halo accretion rate and significantly expand the range of disk masses and formation histories studied. We use the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to enhance the robustness of subhalo tracking. We find that disks near the median disk-to-halo mass ratio of our sample ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} = 2\%$) reduce subhalo peak mass functions within 100 kpc by about $10\%$ for peak masses above $ 10^8\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Heavier, MW/M31-like disks ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} \gtrsim 5\%$) lead to a reduction of more than $40\%$. Subhalo abundance suppression is more pronounced near halo centers, with particularly enhanced stripping for subhalos accreted over 8 Gyr ago on orbits with pericenters &lt; 100 kpc. Suppression is further amplified when disk mass is increased within fixed halo and disk assembly histories. In all cases, the suppression we measure should be interpreted as stripping below the mass resolution limit rather than complete subhalo disruption. This study reshapes our understanding of the MW's impact on its satellites, suggesting it strips subhalos more efficiently than typical MW-mass galaxies due to its larger disk-to-halo mass ratio and earlier disk formation.</description>

      <title>Improved particle spray algorithm for modeling globular cluster streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams that emerge from globular clusters (GCs) are thin stellar structures spread along the orbits of progenitor clusters. Numerical modeling of these streams is essential for understanding their interaction with the host galaxy's mass distribution. Traditional methods are either computationally expensive or oversimplified, motivating us to develop a fast and accurate approach using a particle spray algorithm. By conducting a series of N-body simulations of GCs orbiting a host galaxy, we find that the position and velocity distributions of newly-escaped stream particles are consistent across various GC masses and orbital parameters. Based on these distributions, we develop a new algorithm that avoids computing the detailed internal cluster dynamics by directly drawing tracer particles from these distributions. This algorithm correctly reproduces the action space distribution of stream particles and achieves a 10% accuracy in stream morphology and velocities compared to N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations in the Hydra I cluster from the VEGAS survey III. The realm of low surface brightness features and intra-cluster light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the light distribution in the Hydra I cluster of galaxies to explore their low surface brightness features, measure the intra-cluster light, and address the assembly history of the cluster. For this purpose, we used deep wide-field g- and r-band images obtained with the VST as part of the VEGAS project. The VST mosaic covers ~0.4 times the virial radius around the core of the cluster, which enabled us to map the light distribution down to faint surface brightness levels of mu_g ~ 28 mag/arcsec^2. In this region of the cluster, 44 cluster members are brighter than m_B&lt;16 mag, and the region includes more than 300 dwarf galaxies. Similar to the projected distribution of all cluster members (bright galaxies and dwarfs), we find that the bulk of the galaxy light is concentrated in the cluster core, which also emits in the X-rays, and there are two overdensities: in the north (N) and south-east (SE) with respect to the cluster core. We present the analysis of the light distribution of all the bright cluster members. After removing foreground stars and other objects, we measured the diffuse intra-cluster light and compared its distribution with that of the globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the cluster. We find that most of the diffuse light low surface brightness features, and signs of possible gravitational interaction between galaxies reside in the core and in the group in the N, while ram-pressure stripping is frequently found to affect galaxies within the SE group. All these features confirm that the mass assembly in this cluster is still ongoing. By combining the projected phase-space with these observed properties, we trace the different stages of the assembly history. We also address the main formation channels for the intra-cluster light detected in the cluster, which contributes ~ 12% to the total luminosity of the cluster.</description>

      <title>Stellar bars form dark matter counterparts in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) bars that shadow stellar bars have been previously shown to form in idealized simulations of isolated disk galaxies. Here, we show that DM bars commonly occur in barred disk galaxies in the TNG50 cosmological simulation suite, but do not appear in unbarred disk galaxies. Consistent with isolated simulations, DM bars are typically shorter than their stellar counterparts and are $75\%$ weaker as measured by the Fourier $A_2$ moment. DM bars dominate the shape of the inner halo potential and are easily identified in the time series of quadrupolar coefficients. We present two novel methods for measuring the bar pattern speed using these coefficients, and use them to make a measurement of the pattern speed and rotation axis orientation for one sample galaxy located in one of the high-time resolution subboxes of TNG50. The stellar and dark bars in this galaxy remain co-aligned throughout the last 8 Gyr and have identical pattern speeds throughout. Both the pattern speed and rotation axis orientation of the bars evolve considerably over the last 8 Gyr, consistent with torques on the bars due to dynamical friction and gas accretion. While the bar pattern speed generally decreases over the time course, it is seen to increase after mergers. Rather than remaining static in time, the rotation axis displays both precession and nutation possibly caused by torques outside the plane of rotation. We find that the shape of the stellar and DM mass distributions are tightly correlated with the bar pattern speed.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Ly$\alpha$ Emission in Star Forming Galaxies at $6.5\lesssim z\lesssim13$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of JWST Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy of $z\gtrsim6.5$ galaxies, using observations in the public archive covering galaxies in four independent fields (GOODS-N, GOODS-S, Abell 2744, EGS). We measure Ly$\alpha$ emission line properties for a sample of $210$ $z\simeq6.5-13$ galaxies, with redshifts confirmed independently of Ly$\alpha$ in all cases. We present $3$ new detections of Ly$\alpha$ emission in JWST spectra, including a large equivalent width (EW $=143\ \r{A}$) Ly$\alpha$ emitter with strong CIV emission (EW $=21\ \r{A}$) at $z=7.1$ in GOODS-N. We measure the redshift-dependent Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution across our sample. We find that strong Ly$\alpha$ emission (EW $&gt;25\ \r{A}$) becomes increasingly rare at earlier epochs, suggesting that the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ photons decreases by $4\times$ between $z\simeq5$ and $z\simeq9$. We describe potential implications for the IGM neutral fraction. There is significant field to field variance in the Ly$\alpha$ emitter fraction. In contrast to the three other fields, the EGS shows no evidence for reduced transmission of Ly$\alpha$ photons at $z\simeq7-8$, suggesting a significantly ionized sightline may be present in the field. We use available NIRCam grism observations from the FRESCO survey to characterize overdensities on large scales around known Ly$\alpha$ emitters in the GOODS fields. The strongest overdensities appear linked with extremely strong Ly$\alpha$ detections (EW $&gt;50\ \r{A}$) in most cases. Future Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy with JWST has the potential to constrain the size of ionized regions around early galaxy overdensities, providing a new probe of the reionization process.</description>

      <title>Gas Accretion Traced by Blue-Dominated Ly{\alpha} Emission and Redshifted UV Absorption Lines in Protocluster Galaxies at z = 2.3 from the KBSS-KCWI Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ly{\alpha} emission with a dominant blueshifted peak can probe gas flowing through the circumgalactic medium as it accretes onto galaxies and fuels new star formation, although it has seldom actually been observed. Here we present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of the extended Ly{\alpha} halos surrounding Q1700-BX710 and Q1700-BX711, a pair of UV continuum-selected Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) galaxies at z = 2.3 in the HS1700+643 protocluster. We find that BX710 and BX711's Ly{\alpha} halos are aligned with a large-scale galaxy filament consisting of thirteen spectroscopically identified protocluster galaxies. By measuring the peak separation and blue-to-red peak flux ratio of the Ly{\alpha} emission profiles throughout these galaxies' Ly{\alpha} halos, we have obtained measurements of their spatially varying velocity structure. The prevalence of blue-dominated Ly{\alpha} emission profiles throughout BX711's Ly{\alpha} halo suggests actively accreting gas. We fit a clumpy, multiphase Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer model which assumes a radially varying clump velocity to the spatially resolved Ly{\alpha} emission throughout BX710 and BX711's Ly{\alpha} halos and simultaneously fit these galaxies' average down-the-barrel UV absorption profile with a radially varying velocity model. The results of these models are consistent with a combination of HI and higher-metallicity gas accretion for both galaxies, especially BX711, which exhibits inflow-driven kinematics throughout most of its Ly{\alpha} halo. We consider various accretion scenarios to explain these findings, including accretion of metal-enriched gas from the cosmic web, galaxy interactions, and recycled gas from the circumgalactic medium, all of which are compatible with our current observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse at low to moderate Mach numbers: The relationship between star formation efficiency and the fraction of mass in the massive object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of massive objects via gravitational collapse is relevant both for explaining the origin of the first supermassive black holes and in the context of massive star formation. Here, we analyze simulations of the formation of massive objects pursued by different groups and in various environments, concerning the formation of supermassive black holes, primordial stars, as well as present-day massive stars. We focus particularly on the regime of small virial parameters, i.e., low ratios of the initial kinetic to gravitational energy, low to moderate Mach numbers, and the phase before feedback is very efficient. We compare the outcomes of collapse under different conditions using dimensionless parameters, particularly the star formation efficiency \epsilon_*, the fraction f_* of mass in the most massive object relative to the total stellar mass, and the fraction f_{\rm tot} of mass of the most massive object as a function of the total mass. We find that in all simulations analyzed here, f_{\rm tot} increases as a function of \epsilon_*, although the steepness of the increase depends on the environment. The relation between f_* and \epsilon_* is found to be more complex and also strongly depends on the number of protostars present at the beginning of the simulations. We show that a collision parameter, estimated as the ratio of the system size divided by the typical collision length, allows us to approximately characterize whether collisions will be important. We analyze the statistical correlation between the dimensionless quantities using the Spearman coefficient and confirm via a machine learning analysis that good predictions of f_* can be obtained from \epsilon_* together with a rough estimate of the collision parameter. This suggests that a good estimate of the mass of the most massive object can be obtained once the maximum efficiency for a given environment is known.</description>

      <title>State Space Modelling for detecting and characterising Gravitational Waves afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the usage of an innovative method for selecting transients and variables. These sources are detected at different wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum spanning from radio waves to gamma-rays. We focus on radio signals and use State Space Models, which are also referred to as Dynamic Linear Models. State Space Models (and more generally parametric autoregressive models) have been the mainstay of economic modelling for some years, but rarely they have been used in Astrophysics. The statistics currently used to identify radio variables and transients are not sophisticated enough to distinguish different types of variability. These methods simply report the overall modulation and significance of the variability, and the ordering of the data in time is insignificant. State Space Models are much more advanced and can encode not only the amount and significance of the variability but also properties, such as slope, rise or decline for a given time t. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of State Space Models for transient and variable detection including classification in time-series astronomy. We also propose a method for detecting a transient source hosted in a variable active galaxy, whereby the time-series of a static host galaxy and the dynamic nature of the transient in the galaxy are intertwined. Furthermore, we examine the hypothetical scenario where the target transient we want to detect is the gravitational wave source GW170817 (or similar).</description>

      <title>The Lower Limit of Dynamical Black Hole Masses Detectable in Virgo Compact Stellar Systems Using the JWST/NIRSpec IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to observational challenges, the mass function of black holes (BH) at lower masses is poorly constrained in the local universe. Understanding the occupation fraction of BHs in low-mass galaxies is crucial for constraining the origins of supermassive BH seeds. Compact stellar systems (CSSs), including ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and compact elliptical galaxies (cEs), are potential intermediate-mass BH hosts. Despite the difficulties posed by their limited spheres of influence, stellar dynamical modeling has been effective in estimating central BH masses in CSSs. Some CSSs may harbor a BH constituting up to 20% of their host stellar mass, while others might not have a central BH. In support of our ongoing efforts to determine the BH masses in select CSSs in the Virgo cluster using JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations and orbit-superposition dynamical models, we create mock kinematic data mimicking the characteristics of observed cEs/UCDs in the Virgo cluster with different BH masses. We then construct a series of dynamical models using the orbit-superposition code FORSTAND and explore the accuracy of recovering the BH mass. We find that the mass of BHs comprising 1% or more of the total host stellar mass can be accurately determined through kinematic maps featuring higher-order velocity moments. We also assess how BH mass measurement is affected by deprojection methods, regularization factors, anisotropy parameters, orbit initial conditions, the absence of higher-order velocity moments, spatial resolution, and the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>The RAdio Galaxy Environment Reference Survey (RAGERS): Evidence of an anisotropic distribution of submillimeter galaxies in the 4C 23.56 protocluster at z=2.48</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift radio(-loud) galaxies (H$z$RGs) are massive galaxies with powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and serve as beacons for protocluster identification. However, the interplay between H$z$RGs and the large-scale environment remains unclear. To understand the connection between H$z$RGs and the surrounding obscured star formation, we investigated the overdensity and spatial distribution of submillimeter-bright galaxies (SMGs) in the field of 4C\,23.56, a well-known H$z$RG at $z=2.48$. We used SCUBA-2 data ($\sigma\,{\sim}\,0.6$\,mJy) to estimate the $850\,{\rm \mu m}$ source number counts and examine the radial and azimuthal overdensities of the $850\,{\rm \mu m}$ sources in the vicinity of the H$z$RG. The angular distribution of SMGs is inhomogeneous around the H$z$RG 4C\,23.56, with fewer sources oriented along the radio jet. We also find a significant overdensity of bright SMGs (${\rm S}_{850\rm\,\mu m}\geq5\,$mJy). Faint and bright SMGs exhibit different spatial distributions. The former are concentrated in the core region, while the latter prefer the outskirts of the H$z$RG field. High-resolution observations show that the seven brightest SMGs in our sample are intrinsically bright, suggesting that the overdensity of bright SMGs is less likely due to the source multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Strong Chemical Tagging in FIRE: Intra and Inter-Cluster Chemical Homogeneity in Open Clusters in Milky Way-like Galaxy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open star clusters are the essential building blocks of the Galactic disk; "strong chemical tagging" - the premise that all star clusters can be reconstructed given chemistry information alone - is a driving force behind many current and upcoming large Galactic spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we characterize abundance patterns for 9 elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe) in open clusters (OCs) in three galaxies (m12i, m12f, and m12m) from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 simulations to investigate if strong chemical tagging is possible in these simulations. We select young massive (&gt;=10^(4.6) Msun) OCs formed in the last ~100 Myr and calculate the intra- and inter-cluster abundance scatter for these clusters. We compare these results with analogous calculations drawn from observations of OCs in the Milky Way. We find the intra-cluster scatter of the observations and simulations to be comparable. While the abundance scatter within each cluster is minimal (&lt;0.020 dex), the mean abundance patterns of different clusters are not unique. We also calculate the chemical difference in intra- and inter-cluster star pairs and find it, in general, to be so small that it is difficult to distinguish between stars drawn from the same OC or from different OCs. Despite tracing three distinct nucleosynthetic families (core-collapse supernovae, white dwarf supernovae, and stellar winds), we conclude that these elemental abundances do not provide enough discriminating information to use strong chemical tagging for reliable OC membership.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations: Three Different Types of Galaxy Alignment in IllustrisTNG100 Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, galaxy samples have been generated using mock observation techniques based on the results of IllustrisTNG100-1 simulations to investigate three forms of intrinsic alignment: satellite-central alignment between the orientation of the brightest group galaxies (BGG) and the spatial distribution of their satellites, radial alignment between the satellites' orientation and the direction towards their BGG, as well as direct alignment between the orientation of BGG and that of its satellites. Overall, the predictions of galaxy alignment generally align with observations, although minor discrepancies have been identified. For satellite-central alignment, the alignment strength and color-dependence trends are well replicated by the mock observations. Regarding radial alignment, the signals are weak but discernible, with no apparent color dependence. As for direct alignment, no signal is detected, nor is there any color dependence. We also investigate the alignment dependencies on halo or the BGG properties, and proximity effect. For satellite-central alignment, the predicted alignment signal shows a positive correlation with halo and BGG mass, consistent with observations and previous predictions. Similar correlations have also been observed with the BGG age and metallicity, which merit future observational analysis for confirmation. Proximity effects have been observed for all three types of alignment, with satellites closer to the BGG exhibiting stronger alignment signals. The influence of galaxy definition and shape determination on alignment studies is also analyzed. This study underscores the importance of employing mock observation techniques for a fair comparison between predictions and observations.</description>

      <title>Accurate Simultaneous Constraints on the Dust Mass, Temperature and Emissivity Index of a Galaxy at Redshift 7.31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new multi-frequency ALMA continuum observations of the massive [$\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) = 10.3_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$], UV-luminous [$M_\mathrm{UV} = -21.7 \pm 0.2$] $z=7.31$ galaxy REBELS-25 in Bands 3, 4, 5, and 9. Combining the new observations with previously-taken data in Bands 6 and 8, we cover the dust continuum emission of the galaxy in six distinct bands -- spanning rest-frame $50-350\,\mu$m -- enabling simultaneous constraints on its dust mass ($M_\mathrm{dust}$), temperature ($T_\mathrm{dust}$) and emissivity index ($\beta_\mathrm{IR}$) via modified blackbody fitting. Given a fiducial model of optically thin emission, we infer a cold dust temperature of $T_\mathrm{dust} = 32_{-6}^{+9}\,$K and a high dust mass of $\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{dust}/M_\odot) = 8.2_{-0.4}^{+0.6}$, and moderately optically thick dust does not significantly alter these estimates. If we assume dust production is solely through supernovae (SNe), the inferred dust yield would be high, $y = 0.7_{-0.4}^{+2.3}\,M_\odot$ per SN. Consequently, we argue grain growth in the interstellar medium of REBELS-25 also contributes to its dust build-up. This is supported by the steep dust emissivity index $\beta_\mathrm{IR} = 2.5 \pm 0.4$ we measure for REBELS-25, as well as by its high stellar mass, dense interstellar medium, and metal-rich nature. Our results suggest that constraining the dust emissivity indices of high-redshift galaxies is important not only to mitigate systematic uncertainties in their dust masses and obscured star formation rates, but also to assess if dust properties evolve across cosmic time. We present an efficient observing setup to do so with ALMA, combining observations of the peak and Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the dust emission.</description>

      <title>Star Formation, Nebulae, and Active Galactic Nuclei in CLASH Brightest Cluster Galaxies. I. Dependence on Core Entropy of Intracluster Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set the stage for reassessing how star formation, emission-line nebulae, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) depend on the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM). Our work is based on the 25 clusters observed in the CLASH program for which the aforementioned attributes in their BCGs can be well scrutinized, as has the thermodynamics of their ICM. Nine of these BCGs display complex UV morphologies tracing recent star formation, whereas the remaining 16 are characterized by a relatively compact central UV enhancement. Here, we show definitively that three of the latter BCGs also display star formation, whereas the diffuse UV of the remaining 13 is entirely consistent with old low-mass stars. The overall results support the previously established dependence of star formation and nebulae in BCGs on an "excess core entropy," K$_{0}$, for the ICM: all 11 clusters with K$_{0}$ $\leq$ 24 keV cm$^{2}$ (but only one of 14 clusters with K$_{0}$ $\geq$ 42 keV cm$^{2}$) host star-forming BCGs that almost if not always possess nebulae. Instead of an entropy floor, we show that K$_{0}$ reflects the degree to which the radial entropy profile decreases inward within $\sim$100 kpc rather than (except perhaps at large K$_{0}$) actually flattening: clusters with lower ICM entropies and hence shorter cooling times at their cores preferentially host BCGs displaying star formation, nebulae, and more radio-luminous AGNs. Nearly all BCGs possess detectable AGNs, however, indicating multiple pathways for fuelling their AGNs.</description>

      <title>A stochastic and analytical model of hierarchical fragmentation: The fragmentation of gas structures into young stellar objects in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular clouds are the most important incubators of young stars clustered in various stellar structures whose spatial extension can vary from a few AU to several thousand AU. Although the reality of these stellar systems has been established, the physical origin of their multiplicity remains an open question. Our aim was to characterise these stellar groups at the onset of their formation by quantifying both the number of stars they contain and their mass using a hierarchical fragmentation model of the natal molecular cloud. We developed a stochastic and predictive model that reconciles the continuous multi-scale structure of a fragmenting molecular cloud with the discrete nature of the stars that are the products of this fragmentation. This model was implemented within a gravo-turbulent fragmentation framework to analytically follow the fragmentation properties along spatial scales using an isothermal and adiabatic equations of state (EOSs). Using an adiabatic EOS we determined a characteristic spatial scale where further fragmentation is prevented, around a few tens of AU. We show that fragmentation is a self-regulated process as fragments tend to become marginally unstable following a $M \propto R$ Bonnor-Ebert-like mass-size profile. Supersonic turbulent fragmentation structures the cloud down to $R \approx 0.1$ pc, and gradually turns into a less productive Jeans-type fragmentation under subsonic conditions so hierarchical fragmentation is a scale dependant process. Our work suggests that pre-stellar objects resulting from gas fragmentation, have to progressively increase their accretion rate in order to form stars. A hierarchical fragmentation scenario is compatible with both the multiplicity of stellar systems identified in Taurus and the multi-scale structure extracted within NGC 2264 molecular cloud.</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamical states on galaxy clusters populations. I. Classification of dynamical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the influence of galaxy clusters on galaxy evolution is relatively well-understood, the impact of the dynamical states of these clusters is less clear. This paper series explores how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters affects their galaxy populations' physical and morphological properties. The primary aim of this first paper is to evaluate the dynamical state of 87 massive ($M_{500} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters at low redshifts ($0.10 \leq z \leq 0.35$). This will allow us to have a well-characterized sample for analyzing physical and morphological properties in our next work. We employ six dynamical state proxies utilizing optical and X-ray imaging data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to integrate these proxies effectively, allowing for robust classification of galaxy clusters into relaxed, intermediate, and disturbed states based on their dynamical characteristics. The methodology successfully segregates the galaxy clusters into the three dynamical states. Examination of the galaxy distributions in optical wavelengths and gas distributions in X-ray further confirms the consistency of these classifications. The clusters' dynamical states are statistically distinguishable, providing a clear categorization for further analysis.</description>

      <title>Binding Energies and Vibrational Spectral Features of S$_n$ Species on Amorphous Water-ice Mantles: A Quantum Mechanical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the denser and colder regions of the interstellar medium (ISM), gas-phase sulfur is depleted by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude with respect to its cosmic abundance. Thus, which species are the main carriers of sulfur is an open question. Recent studies have proposed S$_n$ species as potential sulfur reservoirs. Among the various sulfur allotropes, the most stable one is the S$_8$ ring, detected in the asteroid Ryugu and Orgueil meteorite. Shorter species, namely S$_3$ and S$_4$, have been found in the comet 67P/C-G, but their presence in the ISM remains elusive. In this study, we compute the binding energies (BEs) of S$_n$ (n = 1-8) species on an amorphous water-ice surface model and analyze their infrared (IR) and Raman spectral features to provide data for their identification in the ISM. Our computations reveal that these species exhibit lower BEs than previously assumed and that their spectral features experience minimal shifts when adsorbed on water ice, because of the weak and nonspecific S$_n$-ice interactions. Furthermore, these species display very low IR band intensities and, therefore, very accurate instruments operating in the mid-IR range are required for detecting the presence of these species in dense interstellar environments.</description>

      <title>Polarized synchrotron data and the structure of the Galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarized synchrotron data of the northern C-BASS survey show a surprisingly low linear polarization fraction, $\Pi\simeq 3\%$, while the magnetic field polarization features coherent structures over rather large angular scales. The low polarization degree points to a strong dominance of the turbulent magnetic field -- in agreement with the observation that the total synchrotron intensity is much larger than expected from the regular component in current models for the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). In contrast, studies of cosmic ray propagation employing these GMF models suggest that cosmic rays propagate anisotropically, what in turn requires weak turbulent fields. As a solution to this contradicting requirements, we suggest that the GMF consists of three components with different levels of turbulence: a disk dominated by the turbulent field, a halo dominated by the regular field, plus an extended turbulent halo field.</description>

      <title>COSMOS Brightest Group Galaxies -- III: Evolution of stellar ages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique characteristics of the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) link the evolutionary continuum between galaxies like the Milky Way and more massive BCGs in dense clusters. This study investigates the stellar properties of BGGs over cosmic time (z = 0.08-1.30), extending our previous work (Gozaliasl et al. 2016, 2018; Paper I and Paper II). We analyze data of 246 BGGs from our X-ray galaxy group catalog in the COSMOS field, examining stellar age, mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and halo mass. Comparisons are made with Millennium and Magneticum simulations. We explore the variation of stellar properties with the projected offset from the X-ray peak or host halo center. Using a mock galaxy catalog, we evaluated the accuracy of SED-derived stellar ages, finding a mean absolute error of about one Gyr. Observed BGG age distributions show a bias towards younger ages compared to semi-analytical models and the Magneticum simulation. Our analysis of stellar age versus mass reveals trends with a positive slope, suggesting complex evolutionary pathways across redshifts. We observe a negative correlation between stellar age and SFR across all redshift ranges. Using a cosmic-time-dependent main sequence framework, we identify star-forming BGGs, finding that about 20% of BGGs in the local universe exhibit star-forming characteristics, increasing to 50% at $z=1.0$. Our findings support an inside-out formation scenario for BGGs, where older stellar populations are near the X-ray peak and younger populations at larger offsets indicate ongoing star formation. The distribution of stellar ages for lower-mass BGGs ($10^{10-11} M_\odot$) deviates from constant ages predicted by models, highlighting current models' limitations in capturing galaxies' complex star formation histories.</description>

      <title>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: Survey Overview and Public Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CO(1-0) line has been carefully calibrated as a tracer of molecular gas mass. However, recent studies often favor higher J transitions of the CO molecule which are brighter and accessible for redshift ranges where CO(1-0) is not. These lines are not perfect analogues for CO(1-0), owing to their more stringent excitation conditions, and must be calibrated for use as molecular gas tracers. Here we introduce the Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT (AMISS), a multi-CO line survey of z~0 galaxies conducted to calibrate the CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) lines. The final survey includes CO(2-1) spectra of 176 galaxies and CO(3-2) spectra for a subset of 45. We supplement these with archival CO(1-0) spectra from xCOLD GASS for all sources and additional CO(1-0) observations with the Kitt Peak 12m Telescope. Targets were selected to be representative of the galaxy population in the stellar mass range of $10^9$ to $10^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$. Our project emphasized careful characterization of statistical and systematic uncertainties to enable studies of trends in CO line ratios. We show that optical and CO disk sizes are on average equal, for both the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) line. We measure the distribution of CO line luminosity ratios, finding medians (16th-84th percentile) of 0.71 (0.51-0.96) for the CO(2-1)-to-CO(1-0) ratio, 0.39 (0.24-0.53) for the CO(3-2)-to-CO(1-0) ratio, and 0.53 (0.41-0.74) for the CO(3-2)-to-CO(2-1) ratio. A companion paper presents our study of CO(2-1)'s applicability as a molecular gas mass tracer and search for trends in the CO(2-1)-to-CO(1-0) ratio. Our catalog of CO line luminosities will be publicly available with the published version of this article.</description>

      <title>SDSS-IV MaNGA: Stellar rotational support in disk galaxies vs. central surface density and stellar population age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the stellar rotational support changes as a function of spatially resolved stellar population age ($\rm D_n4000$) and relative central stellar surface density ($\Delta \Sigma_1$) for MaNGA isolated/central disk galaxies. We find that the galaxy rotational support $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ varies smoothly as a function of $\Delta \Sigma_1$ and $\rm D_n4000$. $\rm D_n4000$ vs. $\Delta \Sigma_1$ follows a "J-shape", with $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ contributing to the scatters. In this "J-shaped" pattern rotational support increases with central $\rm D_n4000$ when $\Delta \Sigma_1$ is low but decreases with $\Delta \Sigma_1$ when $\Delta \Sigma_1$ is high. Restricting attention to low-$\Delta \Sigma_1$ (i.e, large-radius) galaxies, we suggest that the trend of increasing rotational support with $\rm D_n4000$ for these objects is produced by a mix of two different processes, a primary trend characterized by growth in $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ along with mass through gas accretion, on top of which disturbance episodes are overlaid, which reduce rotational support and trigger increased star formation. An additional finding is that star forming galaxies with low $\Delta \Sigma_1$ have relatively larger radii than galaxies with higher $\Delta \Sigma_1$ at fixed stellar mass. Assuming that these relative radii rankings are preserved while galaxies are star forming then implies clear evolutionary paths in central $\rm D_n4000$ vs. $\Delta \Sigma_1$. The paper closes with comments on the implications that these paths have for the evolution of pseudo-bulges vs. classical-bulges. The utility of using $\rm D_n4000$-$\Delta \Sigma_1$ to study $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ reinforces the notion that galaxy kinematics correlate both with structure and with stellar-population state, and indicates the importance of a multi-dimensional description for understanding bulge and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A Targeted Search for Variable Gravitationally Lensed Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to identify photometric variability within strong gravitationally lensing candidates, in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. In our first paper (Sheu et al. 2023), we laid out our pipeline and presented seven new gravitationally lensed supernovae candidates in a retrospective search. In this companion paper, we apply a modified version of that pipeline to search for gravitationally lensed quasars. From a sample of 5807 strong lenses, we have identified 13 new gravitationally lensed quasar candidates (three of them quadruply-lensed). We note that our methodology differs from most lensed quasar search algorithms that solely rely on the morphology, location, and color of the candidate systems. By also taking into account the temporal photometric variability of the posited lensed images in our search via difference imaging, we have discovered new lensed quasar candidates. While variability searches using difference imaging algorithms have been done in the past, they are typically preformed over vast swathes of sky, whereas we specifically target strong gravitationally lensed candidates. We also have applied our pipeline to 655 known gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from past lensed quasar searches, of which we identify 13 that display significant variability (one of them quadruply-lensed). This pipeline demonstrates a promising search strategy to discover gravitationally lensed quasars in other existing and upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>AT2023vto: An Exceptionally Luminous Helium Tidal Disruption Event from a Massive Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical/UV observations and the spectroscopic classification of the transient AT2023vto as a tidal disruption event (TDE) at z = 0.4846. The spectrum is dominated by a broad He II $\lambda$4686 emission line, with a width of ~ $3.76 \times 10^4$ km/s and a blueshift of ~ $1.05 \times 10^4$ km/s, classifying it as a member of the TDE-He class. The light curve exhibits a long rise and decline timescale, with a large peak absolute magnitude of M$_g$ ~ -23.6, making it the most luminous of the classical optical TDEs (H, H+He, He) discovered to date by about 2 mag (and ~ 4 mag compared to the mean of the population). The light curve exhibits a persistent blue color of g - r ~ -0.4 mag throughout its evolution, similar to other TDEs, but distinct from supernovae. We identify the host galaxy of AT2023vto in archival Pan-STARRS images and find that the transient is located at the galaxy center, and that its inferred central black hole mass is ~ $10^7~M_{\odot}$. Modeling the light curves of AT2023vto, we find that it resulted from the disruption of a ~ 9 $M_{\odot}$ star by a ~$10^7~M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole. The star mass is about 5 times larger than the highest star masses previously inferred in TDEs, and the black hole mass is at the high end of the distribution. AT2023vto is comparable in luminosity and timescale to some putative TDEs (with a blue featureless continuum), as well as to the mean of the recently identified population of ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), although the latter are spectroscopically distinct and tend to have longer timescales. ANTs have been speculated to arise from tidal disruptions of massive stars, perhaps in active galactic nuclei, and AT2023vto may represent a similar case but in a dormant black hole, thereby bridging the TDE and ANT populations. We anticipate that Rubin Observatory / LSST will uncover similar luminous TDEs to z ~ 3.</description>

      <title>OGLE-IV Period-Luminosity relation of the LMC: an analysis using mean and median magnitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TThe Period-Luminosity (PL) relation for Cepheid variable stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is crucial for distance measurements in astronomy. This study analyzes the impact of using the median rather than the mean on the PL relation's slope and zero point. It also examines the persistence of the break at approximately 10 days and addresses specification issues in the PL relation model. Using $VI$-band median and mean magnitudes from the OGLE-IV survey, corrected for extinction, we fit the PL relation employing robust $MM$-regression, which features a high breakdown point and robust standard errors. Statistical tests and residual analysis are conducted to identify and correct model deficiencies. Our findings indicate a significant change in the PL relation for Cepheids with periods of 10 days or longer, regardless of whether median or mean magnitudes are used. A bias in the zero point and slope estimators is observed when using median magnitudes instead of mean magnitudes, especially in the $V$-band. By identifying and correcting regression issues and considering the period break, our estimators for slope and zero point are more accurate for distance calculations. Comparative analysis of the models for each band quantifies the bias introduced by using median magnitudes, highlighting the importance of considering the Cepheids' period for accurate location measure results, similar to those obtained using mean magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic fields of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of the pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic field on the radiation pattern of giant black holes. In particular, for a sufficiently wide spectrum of supermassive black holes, we studied what energy photons will decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Investigation of $\gamma$-ray Source MGRO J1908+06 Emission Using {\it Fermi}--LAT, VERITAS, and HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission from MGRO J1908+06 in the GeV-TeV energy band. By analyzing the data collected by {\it Fermi}--LAT, VERITAS, and HAWC, with the addition of spectral data previously reported by LHAASO, a multiwavelength (MW) study of the morphological and spectral features of MGRO J1908+06 provides insight into the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission. The mechanism behind the bright TeV emission is studied by constraining the magnetic field strength, the source age and the distance through detailed broadband modeling. Both spectral shape and energy-dependent morphology support the scenario that inverse-Compton (IC) emission of an evolved pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR J1907+0602 is responsible for the MGRO J1908+06 $\gamma$-ray emission with a best-fit true age of $T=22\pm 9$ kyr and a magnetic field of $B=5.4 \pm 0.8\ \mu\mathrm{G}$, assuming the distance to the pulsar $d_{\mathrm{PSR}}=3.2$ kpc.</description>

      <title>A new probe of dark matter-baryon interactions in compact stellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of an attractive long-range interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our study highlights the role of this interaction in inducing dynamical friction between dark matter and stars, which can significantly influence the evolution of compact stellar systems. Using the star cluster in Eridanus II as a case study, we derive a new stringent upper bound on the interaction strength $\tilde{\alpha}\leq 333.7$ for the interaction range $\lambda = 1$ pc. This constraint is independent of the dark matter mass and can improve the existing model-independent limits on $\tilde{\alpha}$ by a few orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we observe that the constraint is insensitive to the mass of the stellar system and the dark matter density in the stellar system as long as the system is dark matter dominated. This new approach can be applied to many other stellar systems, and we obtain comparable constraints from compact stellar halos observed in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Selection bias obfuscates the discovery of fast radio bursts sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FRBs are a newly discovered class of extragalactic radio transients characterised by their high energy and short-duration (~$\mu$s-ms)[1]. Their elusive physical origin remains a subject of ongoing research, with magnetars emerging as leading candidates[2],[3]. Previous studies have employed various methodologies to address the FRB origin problem, including demographic analyses of FRB host galaxies and their local environments[4]-[6], assessments of FRB rate evolution with redshift[7]-[9], and searches for proposed multi-messenger FRB counterparts[10]. However, these studies are susceptible to significant biases stemming from unaccounted radio and optical selection effects. Here we present empirical evidence for a substantial selection bias against detecting FRBs in galaxies with large inclination angles (edge-on) using a sample of hosts identified for FRBs discovered by untargeted surveys. This inclination-related bias likely leads to a significant underestimation (by about a factor of two) of the FRB rates reported in the literature and disfavours globular clusters as the dominant origin of FRB sources, as previously speculated[6]. These conclusions have important implications for FRB progenitor models and targeted FRB follow-up strategies. We further investigate the impact of this bias on the relative rate of FRBs in different host environments. Our analysis suggests that scattering in FRB hosts is likely responsible for the observed bias[11],[12]. However, a larger sample of localised FRBs is required to robustly quantify its contribution in the inclination-related selection bias.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Beyond Spectroscopy III. Stellar Parameters and Elemental-abundance Ratios for Five Million Stars from DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of stellar parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity $\log g$, age, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [$\alpha$/Fe]) for some five million stars (4.5 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giants stars) in the Milky Way, based on stellar colors from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and \textit{Gaia} EDR3. These estimates are obtained through the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters and abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a Kernel Principal Component Analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by J-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good or better than derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a wide range of the parameter space: 0.10-0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [$\alpha$/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the influence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity estimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now been removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] $\sim -4.0$, with typical uncertainties of 0.25 dex and 0.40 dex for dwarfs and giants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the exploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The GRAVITY young stellar object survey XIV : Investigating the magnetospheric accretion-ejection processes in S CrA N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dust- and gas-rich protoplanetary disks around young stellar systems play a key role in star and planet formation. While considerable progress has recently been made in probing these disks on large scales of a few tens of astronomical units (au), the central au needs to be more investigated. We aim at unveiling the physical processes at play in the innermost regions of the strongly accreting T Tauri Star S CrA N by means of near-infrared interferometric observations. The K-band continuum emission is well reproduced with an azimuthally-modulated dusty ring. As the star alone cannot explain the size of this sublimation front, we propose that magnetospheric accretion is an important dust-heating mechanism leading to this continuum emission. The differential analysis of the Hydrogen Br$\gamma$ line is in agreement with radiative transfer models combining magnetospheric accretion and disk winds. Our observations support an origin of the Br$\gamma$ line from a combination of (variable) accretion-ejection processes in the inner disk region.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Planetary Nebula NGC 4361 with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical line and continuum emission in the very high ionization Galactic planetary nebula (PN) NGC 4361 (PN G294.1 +43.6), has been mapped with VLT MUSE Wide Field normal mode (4750-9300A) commissioning observations. The PN is larger than a single MUSE field and only the central 1 arcmin square was observed in good conditions. Images in recombination and collisionally excited emission lines were extracted and line ratios provide dust extinction, electron density and temperature and ionic abundances. The nebula is confirmed as optically thin in the H-ionizing continuum based on its very low He I emission, even to the edges of the field, but is not completely optically thin. The electron temperature Te is shown to have large-scale spatially coherent structure, as indicated from previous spectra. Prior to this study, no low ionization emission had been positively detected; MUSE revealed both weak extended [N II] and [O II] and $&gt;$100 spatially unresolved low ionization knots (dubbed 'Freckles'). There are several linear associations of the Freckles but none point back convincingly to the central star. The Freckle spectra show low-moderate ionization with Te $\sim$11000 K, Ne $\sim$1500 cm$^{-3}$ and higher extinction than the highly ionized medium, but do not clearly differ in (He, N, O, S) abundance with respect to the extended gas. The spatial distribution and radial velocities suggest that the Freckles belong to a thick disk oriented perpendicular to the large-scale nebula, perhaps remnants of an earlier structure. Within the MUSE field, a low redshift emission line galaxy was serendipitously found hiding behind NGC 4361. The spectrum of this dwarf galaxy was extracted from the bright foreground nebular emission: it is a low luminosity disk galaxy at $\sim$87 Mpc with bright H II regions (12+log(O/H) $\sim$ 8.4), probably a Magellanic irregular or low-mass spiral.

      <title>PKS~J0805$-$0111: A Second Owens Valley Radio Observatory Blazar Showing Highly Significant Sinusoidal Radio Variability -- The Tip of the Iceberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) observations of supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidate PKS~2131$-$021 revealed, for the first time, six likely characteristics of the phenomenology exhibited by SMBHB in blazars, of which the most unexpected and critical is sinusoidal flux density variations. We have now identified a second blazar, PKS~J0805$-$0111, showing significant sinusoidal variations, with an observed period that translates to $1.422 \pm 0.005$ yr in the rest frame of the $z = 1.388$ object. We generate $10^6$ simulated light curves to reproduce the radio variability characteristics of PKS~J0805$-$0111, and show that the global probability, considering the \textit{look-elsewhere effect}, indicates that the observed periodicity can be attributed to the red noise tail of the power spectral density, with a $p_0$ value of $7.8 \times 10^{-5}$ (i.e. 3.78$\sigma$). PKS J0805$-$0111 displays all six characteristics observed in PKS 2131$-$021. Taking into account the well-defined OVRO sample size, the false positive probability $\sim 0.22$, but the rare behavior makes this a strong SMBHB candidate. The discovery of a second SMBHB candidate exhibiting these rare characteristics reveals that PKS~2131$-$021 is not a unique, isolated case. With these two strong cases we are clearly seeing only the tip of the iceberg. We estimate that the number of SMBHB candidates amongst blazars $\sim$ 1 in 100.</description>

      <title>Attenuation from the optical to the extreme ultraviolet by dust associated with broad absorption line quasars: the driving force for outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.03733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a mean attenuation curve out to the rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV) for 'BAL dust' - the dust causing the additional extinction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad absorption lines (BALQSOs). In contrast to the normal, relatively flat, mean AGN attenuation curve, BAL dust is well fit by a steeply rising, SMC-like curve. We confirm the shape of the theoretical Weingartner &amp; Draine SMC curve out to 700 Angstroms but the drop in attenuation at still shorter wavelengths is less than predicted. The similar SMC-like attenuation curve for low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs) does not support the idea that they are an early phase in the life of an AGN when it is breaking out of a cocoon of star-forming dust. Although the attenuation is only E(B - V) ~ 0.03 - 0.05 in the optical, it rises to one magnitude in the EUV, which is an optimum value for radiative acceleration of dusty gas. Because the spectral energy distribution of AGNs peaks in the EUV, the force on the dust dominates the acceleration of BAL gas. Although the shape of the attenuation curve for LoBALs is similar to the shape for HiBALs, the LoBALs on average show negative attenuation in the optical. This is naturally explained if there is more light scattered into our line of sight in LoBALs compared with non-BALQSOs. We suggest that this and partial covering are causes when attenuation curves appear to be steeper in the UV than an SMC curve.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved Spectroscopic Analysis of Ly$\alpha$ Haloes: Radial Evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ Line Profile out to 60 kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended Ly$\alpha$ haloes (LAHs) have been found to be prevalent around high-redshift star-forming galaxies. However, the origin of the LAHs is still a subject of debate. Spatially resolved analysis of Ly$\alpha$ profiles provides an important diagnostic. We analyse the average spatial extent and spectral variation of the circumgalactic LAHs by stacking a sample of 155 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at redshift $3&lt;z&lt;4$ in the MUSE Extremely Deep Field. Our analysis reveals that, with respect to the Ly$\alpha$ line of the target LAE, the peak of the Ly$\alpha$ line at large distances becomes increasingly more blueshifted up to a projected distance of 60 kpc ($\approx 3 \times$ virial radius), with a velocity offset of $\approx$ 250 km/s. This trend is evident in both the mean and median stacks, suggesting that it is a general property of our LAE sample, which typically has a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity $\mathrm{\approx 10^{41.1} erg\,s^{-1}}$. However, due to the absence of systemic redshift data, it remains unclear whether the Ly$\alpha$ line peak at large projected distances is less redshifted compared to the inner regions or truly blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity. We explore various scenarios to explain the large-scale kinematics of the Ly$\alpha$ line.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter with LAMOST and Gaia. I. Methodology and Local Halo Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel, deep-learning based method -- dubbed Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter, or GS$^{3}$ Hunter for short, to search for substructures and streams in stellar kinematics data. GS$^{3}$ Hunter relies on a combined application of Siamese Neural Networks to transform the phase space information and the K-means algorithm for the clustering. As a validation test, we apply GS$^{3}$ Hunter to a subset of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) cosmological simulations. The stellar streams and substructures thus identified are in good agreement with corresponding results reported earlier by the FIRE team. In the same vein, we apply our method to a subset of local halo stars from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 and GALAH DR3 datasets, and recover several, previously known dynamical groups, such as Thamnos 1+2, Hot Thick Disk, ED-1, L-RL3, Helmi 1+2, and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Sequoia, VRM, Cronus, Nereus. Finally, we apply our method without fine-tuning to a subset of K-giant stars located in the inner halo region, obtained from the LAMOST Data Release 5 (DR5) dataset. We recover three, previously known structures (Sagittarius, Hercules-Aquila Cloud, and the Virgo Overdensity), but we also discover a number of new substructures. We anticipate that GS$^{3}$ Hunter will become a useful tool for the community dedicated to the search of stellar streams and structures in the Milky Way (MW) and the Local group, thus helping advance our understanding of the stellar inner and outer halos, and of the assembly and tidal stripping history in and around the MW.</description>

Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is home to many HII regions, which may lead to significant outflows. We examine the LMC's multiphase gas ($T\sim10^{4-5}$ K) in HI, SII, SiIV, and CIV using 110 stellar sight lines from the HST's Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program. We develop a continuum fitting algorithm based on the concept of Gaussian Process regression and identify reliable LMC interstellar absorption over $v_{\rm helio}=175-375$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analyses show disk-wide ionized outflows in SiIV and CIV across the LMC with bulk velocities of $|v_{\rm out, bulk}|\sim20-60$ km s$^{-1}$, which indicates that most of the outflowing mass is gravitationally bound. The outflows' column densities correlate with the LMC's star formation rate surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), and the outflows with higher $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ tend to be more ionized. Considering outflows from both sides of the LMC as traced by CIV, we conservatively estimate a total outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm out}\gtrsim 0.03~M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$ and a mass loading factor of $\eta\gtrsim 0.15$. We compare the LMC's outflows with those detected in starburst galaxies and simulation predictions, and find a universal scaling relation of $|v_{\rm out, bulk}|\propto \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.23}$ over a wide range of star-forming conditions ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}\sim10^{-4.5}-10^{2}~M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1} {\rm kpc}^{-2}$). Lastly, we find that the outflows are co-rotating with the LMC's young stellar disk and the velocity field does not seem to be significantly impacted by external forces; we thus speculate on the existence of a bow shock leading the LMC, which may have shielded the outflows from ram pressure as the LMC orbits the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided direct imaging of the SMBH Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center, indicating it likely spins rapidly with its spin axis significantly misaligned relative to the Galactic plane's angular momentum. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the inferred spin properties of Sgr A* provide evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 145-180 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides potential observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

Abstract: Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way. It is thought to be the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy because of its high mass and its complex stellar populations. To decipher its formation history and study its dynamics, we created the most comprehensive kinematic catalog for its inner region, by analyzing both archival and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our catalog contains 1 395 781 proper-motion measurements out to the half-light radius of the cluster ($\sim$5.0') and down to $m_{F625W}\approx$25. The typical baseline for our proper-motion measurements is 20 years, leading to a median 1D proper motion precision of $\sim$11 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ for stars with $m_{F625W}\approx$18 mag, with even better precision ($\sim$6.6 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$) achieved in the extensively observed centermost (r$&lt;$1.5') region. In addition to our astrometric measurements, we also obtained precise HST photometry in seven filters spanning from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This allows detailed color-magnitude-diagram studies and to separate the multiple stellar populations of the cluster. In this work, we describe the data reduction used to obtain both the photometric and the proper-motion measurements. We also illustrate the creation and the content of our catalog, which is made publicly available. Finally, we present measurements of the plane-of-sky rotation of $\omega$ Cen in the previously unprobed inner few arcminutes and a precise measurement of the inclination $i = (43.9\pm1.3)^\circ$.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>

Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use the MIST stellar models and our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $5.6 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 20 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitor binary stars do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\lesssim$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $\sim 4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$ (for our fiducial model), representing $\sim 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\approx 4000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\approx 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3-like. Given the density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Our models show that, even if it was born inside a stellar cluster, Gaia BH3 is compatible with a primordial binary star that escaped from its parent cluster without experiencing significant dynamical interactions.</description>

      <title>A census of new globular clusters in the Galactic bulge</title>

Abstract: The number of known globular clusters in the Galactic bulge has been increasing steadily thanks to different new surveys. The aim of this study is to provide a census of the newly revealed globular clusters in the Galactic bulge, and analyze their characteristics. In recent years, many globular clusters have been discovered or identified. The stellar populations to which they belong are indicated in their original studies: they are mostly bulge clusters, with some identified as disk or halo members. We collected 41 new globular clusters revealed in the last decade and compared them to the known bulge clusters. The new clusters are intrinsically faint with $M_V$ of around -6.0 mag. The distance to the Sun of the ensemble of well-known and new bulge clusters is compatible with the Galactocentric distance measurements from the Galactic black hole location. The ensemble sample shows metallicity peaks at [Fe/H] ~ -1.08 $\pm$ 0.35 and -0.51 $\pm$ 0.25 dex, confirming previous findings. The age-metallicity relation of the new clusters younger than 10 Gyr is compatible with that of the ex situ samples of the dwarf galaxies Sagittarius, Canis Majoris, and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. The clusters with ages between 11.5 and 13.5 Gyr show no age-metallicity relation, because they are all old. This is compatible with their formation in situ in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the Cosmological Constant requires these masses to be higher. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>High-Redshift Merger Model for Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2023, the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) Collaborations announced the discovery of a gravitational wave background (GWB), predominantly attributed to supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) mergers. However, the detected GWB is several times stronger than the default value expected from galactic observations at low and moderate redshifts. Recent findings by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have unveiled a substantial number of massive, high-redshift galaxies, suggesting more massive SMBHB mergers at these early epochs. Motivated by these findings, we propose an "early merger" model that complements the standard merger statistics by incorporating these early, massive galaxies. We compare the early and standard "late merger" models, which assume peak merger rates in the local Universe, and match both merger models to the currently detected GWB. Our analysis shows that the early merger model has a significantly lower detection probability for single binaries and predicts a ~30% likelihood that the first detectable single source will be highly redshifted and remarkably massive with rapid frequency evolution. In contrast, the late merger model predicts a nearly monochromatic first source at low redshift. The future confirmation of an enhanced population of massive high-redshift galaxies and the detection of fast-evolving binaries would strongly support the early merger model, offering significant insights into the evolution of galaxies and SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Revealing Gas Inflows towards the Galactic Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gas inflows towards the Galactic Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) based on the gas morphological and kinematic features from the MWISP in the region of l=1.2 deg--19.0 deg and |b|&lt;3.0 deg. We find that the near dust lane extends to l~15 deg, in which the end of the large-scale gas structure intersects with the 3 kpc-ring at a distance of ~5 kpc. Intriguingly, many filamentary MCs, together with the bow-like/ballistic-like clouds and continuous CO features with notable velocity gradient, are finely outlined along the long structure. These MCs also have relatively large velocity dispersions, indicating the shocked gas generated by local continuous accretion and thus the enhanced turbulence along the entire gas structure. We suggest that the ~3.1--3.6 kpc long CO structure originates from the accretion molecular gas driven by the Galactic bar. The gas near the bar end at the 3 kpc-ring becomes an important reservoir for the large-scale accreting flows inwards to the CMZ through the bar channel. The inclination angle of the bar is estimated to be 20--26 deg, while the pattern speed of the bar is 30--35 km/s. The total mass of the whole gas lane is about (0.9-1.7)x10^7 Msun according to the calculated X_CO=(0.6-1.4)x10^20 cm^-2 (Kkm/s)^-1 from the large-scale CO data and the complementary HI data. The mean gas inflow rate is about 0.8-1.4 Msun/yr, which seems to be comparable to the outflow's rate of the Galactic nuclear winds after applying the updated lower X-factor value above.</description>

      <title>The Radio Galaxy Environment Reference Survey (RAGERS): a submillimetre study of the environments of massive radio-quiet galaxies at $z = 1{\rm -}3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the environments of massive galaxies at high redshift is crucial to understanding galaxy evolution and the conditions that gave rise to the distribution of matter we see in the Universe today. While high-$z$ radio galaxies (H$z$RGs) and quasars tend to reside in protocluster-like systems, the environments of their radio-quiet counterparts are relatively unexplored, particularly in the submillimetre, which traces dust-obscured star formation. In this study we search for 850 $\mu$m-selected submillimetre galaxies in the environments of massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), radio-quiet ($L_{500 {\rm MHz}} \lesssim 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) galaxies at $z \sim 1\text{--}3$ using S2COSMOS data. By constructing number counts in circular regions of radius 1--6 arcmin and comparing with blank-field measurements, we find no significant overdensities of SMGs around massive radio-quiet galaxies at any of these scales, despite being sensitive down to overdensities of $\delta \sim 0.4$. To probe deeper than the catalogue we also examine the distribution of peaks in the SCUBA-2 SNR map, which reveals only tentative signs of any difference in the SMG densities of the radio-quiet galaxy environments compared to the blank field, and only on smaller scales (1$^{\prime}$ radii, corresponding to $\sim0.5$ Mpc) and higher SNR thresholds. We conclude that massive, radio-quiet galaxies at cosmic noon are typically in environments with $\delta\lesssim0.4$, which are either consistent with the blank field or contain only weak overdensities spanning sub-Mpc scales. The contrast between our results and studies of H$z$RGs with similar stellar masses and redshifts implies an intrinsic link between the wide-field environment and radio AGN luminosity at high redshift.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the central mass contents of Omega Centauri from combined stellar kinematics and pulsar timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a combined analysis of stellar kinematics and line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars to investigate the mass contents of Omega Centauri. We consider multiple mass components: the visible photometric distribution, a central cluster of dark remnants, an intermediate-mass black hole, and a distribution of intermediate extension traced by the pulsars. By self-consistently incorporating multiple independent datasets, including the effects of different centers, we obtain significant constraints on these mass distributions. Our results strongly favor an extended central mass of ~ 2 - 3 x 10^5 Msun, emulating a cluster of heavy stellar remnants, over an IMBH, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 6 x 10^3 Msun on its mass. Pulsar timing observations provide significant constraints, favoring a central mass distribution that is ~ 20% more massive and extended. Notably, we observe a clear linear scaling between the pulsar distribution and stellar encounter rates, showing excellent agreement with the expectation from millisecond pulsar formation models and motivating a profile for their distribution, providing the first validation of its kind where positions are linked to their place of formation in globular clusters. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this novel methodology in exploring the structure of star clusters, setting a promising precedent amid the advent of the rapidly growing number of observations and discoveries currently being experienced in this field.</description>

      <title>Impact of astrophysical scatter on the Epoch of Reionization [H I]$_{\rm 21cm}$ bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the first star-forming galaxies are the main drivers of cosmic reionization. It is usually assumed that there is a one-to-one relationship between the star formation rate (SFR) inside a galaxy and the host halo mass in semi-analytical/numerical modeling of large-scale reionization. However, more accurate simulations and observations suggest that the SFR and ionizing luminosity in galaxies may vary considerably even if the host halo mass is the same. This astrophysical scatter can introduce an additional non-Gaussianity in the HI 21-cm signal, which the power spectrum might not capture adequately. In this work, we have studied the impact of the scatter on the HI 21-cm bispectrum using semi-numerical simulations. Although the fractional change in the HI 21-cm bispectra due to the scatter is found to be more than a factor of $10$ at large scales ($k_1 \lesssim 1\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) for $z=7.4$, it is found to be statistically insignificant. However, at small scales ($k_1\sim2.55$~Mpc$^{-1}$), we have found the impact due to the scatter to be high in magnitude ($|\langle \Delta B \rangle/B_{\text{no-scatter}}| \sim 1$) and statistically significant ($|\langle\Delta B\rangle/\sigma_{\Delta B}| \gtrsim 5$) at neutral fraction, $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.8$ for $z=7.4$. The impact due to scatter is found to be even more prominent ($|\langle \Delta B \rangle/B_{\text{no-scatter}}| \gtrsim 10$) at small scales for $z=10$ and $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.8$, but with reduced statistical significance ($|\langle\Delta B\rangle/\sigma_{\Delta B}| \sim 3$), compared to $z=7.4$ at the same neutral fraction. In the most optimistic scenario, SKA1-Low might be able to detect these signatures of astrophysical scatter, at $\sim 3\sigma$ and $\sim 5\sigma$ detection significance for $\overline{x}_{\rm HI} \sim$ 0.8 and 0.9 respectively, for the equilateral HI 21-cm bispectrum at $z=7.4$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-galaxy lensing data: $f(T)$ gravity challenges General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use galaxy-galaxy lensing data to test General Relativity and $f(T)$ gravity at galaxies scales. We consider an exact spherically symmetric solution of $f(T)$ theory which is obtained from an approximate quadratic correction, and thus it is expected to hold for every realistic deviation from General Relativity. Quantifying the deviation by a single parameter $Q$, and following the post-Newtonian approximation, we obtain the corresponding deviation in the gravitational potential, shear component, and effective excess surface density profile. We used five stellar mass samples and divided them into blue and red to test the model dependence on galaxy color, and we modeled the excess surface density (ESD) profiles using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. Based on the group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) we finally extract $Q=-2.138^{+0.952}_{-0.516}\times 10^{-5}\,$Mpc$^{-2}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence. This result indicates that $f(T)$ corrections on top of General Relativity are favored. Finally, we apply information criteria, such as the AIC and BIC ones, and although the dependence of $f(T)$ gravity on the off-center effect implies that its optimality needs to be carefully studied, our analysis shows that $f(T)$ gravity is more efficient in fitting the data comparing to General Relativity and $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, and thus it offers a challenge to the latter.</description>

Abstract: For decades, the boundary of cosmic filaments have been a subject of debate. In this work, we determine the physically-motivated radii of filaments by constructing stacked galaxy number density profiles around the filament spines. We find that the slope of the profile changes with distance to the filament spine, reaching its minimum at approximately 1 Mpc at z = 0 in both state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations and observational data. This can be taken as the average value of the filament radius. Furthermore, we note that the average filament radius rapidly decreases from z = 4 to z = 1, and then slightly increases. Moreover, we find that the filament radius depends on the filament length, the distance from connected clusters, and the masses of the clusters. These results suggest a two-phase formation scenario of cosmic filaments. The filaments experience rapid contraction before z = 1, but their density distribution has remained roughly stable since then. The subsequent mass transport along the filaments to the connected clusters is likely to have contributed to the formation of the clusters themselves.</description>
