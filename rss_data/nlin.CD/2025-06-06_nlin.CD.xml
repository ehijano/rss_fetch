      <title>Experimental Detection of Dissipative Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than four decades of research on chaos in isolated quantum systems have led to the identification of universal signatures -- such as level repulsion and eigenstate thermalization -- that serve as cornerstones in our understanding of complex quantum dynamics. The emerging field of dissipative quantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems, where interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the first experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by measuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems implemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing gradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for chaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum systems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by a sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of the integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an integrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the quantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process. Our results reveal the universal spectral features of dissipative many-body systems and establish present-day quantum computation platforms, which are predominantly used to run unitary simulations, as testbeds to explore dissipative many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</description>

      <title>Bistability and chaos in the discrete two-gene Andrecut-Kauffman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct numerical analysis of the 2-dimensional discrete-time gene expression model originally introduced by Andrecut and Kauffman (Phys. Lett. A 367: 281-287, 2007). In contrast to the previous studies, we analyze the dynamics with different reaction rates $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ for each of the two genes under consideration. We explore bifurcation diagrams for the model with $\alpha_1$ varying in a wide range and $\alpha_2$ fixed. We detect chaotic dynamics by means of the positive maximum Lyapunov exponent and we scan through selected parameters to detect those combinations for which chaotic dynamics can be found in the model. Moreover, we find bistability in the model, that is, the existence of two disjoint attractors. Both situations are interesting from the point of view of applications, as they imply unpredictability of the dynamics encountered. Finally, we show some specific values of parameters of the model in which the two attractors are of different kind (a periodic orbit and a chaotic attractor) or of the same kind (two periodic orbits or two chaotic attractors).</description>

      <title>Classical periodic orbits in extended phase space for spherical harmonic oscillator with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete analysis of classical periodic orbits (POs) and their bifurcations was conducted in spherical harmonic oscillator system with spin-orbit coupling. The motion of the spin is explicitly considered using the spin canonical variables derived by semiclassical approximation to the spin coherent state path integral representation. In addition to the diametric and two circular PO families with frozen spin, solutions that bridge two circular POs are found in which orbital motion is coupled to spin precession. In addition, each bridge encounters a secondary bifurcation on the way from one circular PO to the other and generates a new PO, that survives at higher energies while maintaining a constant period. The generic expressions for those POs are obtained explicitly, and all the above peculiar bifurcation scenarios are described fully analytically.</description>
