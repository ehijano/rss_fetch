      <title>High-Q Slow-Wave Coplanar Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of methods of maximizing Q for slow-wave coplanar waveguides is described. In addition to the widths of the signal conductor and coplanar ground lines and the distance between them, the length, spacing and stacking of the metal layers of the substrate shield strips are also shown to be critical in maximizing performance. Measured results from more than 50 different devices show that a 7X increase in the quality factor (e.g., Q &gt; 70 at 24 GHz in 0.18 {\mu}m CMOS) is achievable using the optimum topology with optimum dimensions.</description>

      <title>All-optical damping forces enhanced by metasurfaces for stable relativistic lightsail propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightsails are a promising spacecraft concept that can reach relativistic speeds via propulsion by laser light, allowing travel to nearby stars within a human lifetime. The success of a lightsail mission requires that any motion in the plane transverse to the propagation direction is bounded and damped for the entire acceleration phase. Here, we demonstrate that a previously unappreciated relativistic force, which generalizes the Poynting-Robertson effect, can passively damp this transverse motion. We show that this purely optical effect can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to plane mirror sails by judicious design of the scattering response. We thus demonstrate that exploiting relativistic effects may be a practical means to control the motion of lightsails.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Ga-Ion Irradiation on Sub-Micron-Wavelength Spin Waves in Yttrium-Iron-Garnet Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of focused-ion-beam (FIB) irradiation on spin waves with sub-micron wavelengths in Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) films. Time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray (TR-STXM) microscopy was used to image the spin waves in irradiated regions and deduce corresponding changes in the magnetic parameters of the film. We find that the changes of Ga$^+$ irradiation can be understood by assuming a few percent change in the effective magnetization $M_\mathrm{eff}$ of the film due to a trade-off between changes in anisotropy and effective film thickness. Our results demonstrate that FIB irradiation can be used to locally alter the dispersion relation and the effective refractive index $n_\textrm{eff}$ of the film, even for submicron wavelengths. To achieve the same change in $n_\textrm{eff}$ for shorter wavelengths, a higher dose is required, but no significant deterioration of spin wave propagation length in the irradiated regions was observed, even at the highest applied doses.</description>

      <title>Time-space encoded readout for noise suppression and scalable scanning in optically active solid-state spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active solid-state spin systems play an important role in quantum technologies. We introduce a new readout scheme, termed Time to Space (T2S) encoding which decouples spin manipulation from optical readout both temporally and spatially. This is achieved by controlling the spin state within a region of interest, followed by rapid scanning of the optical readout position using an acousto-optic modulator. Time tracking allows the optical readout position to be encoded as a function of time. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles in diamond, we first demonstrate that the T2S scheme enables correlated experiments for efficient common mode noise cancellation in various nano- and microscale sensing scenarios. In the second example, we show highly scalable multi-pixel imaging that does not require a camera and has the potential to accelerate data acquisition by several hundred times compared to conventional scanning methods. We anticipate widespread adoption of this technique, as it requires no additional components beyond those commonly used in optically addressable spin systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of a vortex-based superconducting memory cell: dynamics and geometrical optimization of a fluxonic quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of dense random-access memory is one of the main obstacles to the development of digital superconducting computers. It has been suggested that AVRAM cells, based on the storage of a single Abrikosov vortex, the smallest quantized object in superconductors, can enable drastic miniaturization to the nanometer scale. In this work, we present numerical modeling of such cells using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. The cell represents a fluxonic quantum dot containing a small superconducting island, an asymmetric notch for vortex entrance, a guiding track, and a vortex trap. We determine the optimal geometrical parameters for operation at zero magnetic field and the conditions for controllable vortex manipulation by short current pulses. We report ultra-fast vortex motion with velocities more than an order of magnitude faster than those expected for macroscopic superconductors. This phenomenon is attributed to strong interactions with the edges of a mesoscopic island, combined with the nonlinear reduction of flux-flow viscosity due to nonequilibrium effects in the track. Our results show that such cells can be scaled down to sizes comparable to the London penetration depth, 100 nm, and can enable ultrafast switching on the picosecond scale with ultra-low energy per operation, 0.1 aJ.</description>

      <title>GEM: A GEneral Memristive transistor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic devices, with their distinct advantages in energy efficiency and parallel processing, are pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence applications. Among these devices, memristive transistors have attracted significant attention due to their superior symmetry, stability, and retention characteristics compared to two-terminal memristors. However, the lack of a robust model that accurately captures their complex electrical behavior has hindered further exploration of their potential. In this work, we present the GEneral Memristive transistor model (GEM), a comprehensive voltage-controlled model that addresses this gap. The GEM model incorporates a state-dependent update function, a voltage-controlled moving window function, and a nonlinear current output function, enabling precise representation of the electrical characteristics of memristive transistors. In experiments, the GEM model not only demonstrates a 300% improvement in modeling the memory behavior but also accurately captures the inherent nonlinearities and physical limits of these devices. This advancement significantly enhances the realistic simulation of memristive transistors, thereby facilitating further exploration and application development.</description>

      <title>Effects of Mischmetal Composition and Cooling Rates on the Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Al-(Ce, La, Nd) Eutectic Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the substitution of cerium (Ce) with mischmetal (MM) in cast Al-MM alloys, focusing on microstructure, hardness, tensile and compression properties, creep resistance, and coarsening resistance. Al-MM alloys with various MM compositions (Ce, Ce-50La, Ce-33La, and Ce-27La-19Nd, weight percent) exhibit near-eutectic and hyper-eutectic microstructures for Al-9MM and Al-12MM compositions, respectively, with similar as-cast hardness (~525 MPa). All Al-9MM alloys show tensile yield stress ~55 MPa, ultimate tensile strength ~130 MPa, and fracture strain ~8%.The microstructural and mechanical properties consistency demonstrates the flexibility of MM compositions in Al-MM alloys. Al-9MM exhibits excellent coarsening resistance, with minimal hardness reduction when exposed to 300 and 350 C for up to 11 weeks, and a modest ~15% hardness reduction at 400 C for 8 weeks, outperforming eutectic Al-12.6Si and Al-6.4Ni alloys. Additionally, Al-9MM shows higher creep resistance at 300 C compared to most precipitate-strengthened Al-Sc-Zr and solid-solution-strengthened Al-Mg/Mn alloys, but is outperformed by eutectic-strengthened Al-6.4Ni and Al-10Ce-5Ni alloys.The effect of casting cooling rate is investigated through wedge casting: Al-9Ce transitions from hypo- to hyper-eutectic as cooling rates decrease, while Al-12Ce consistently shows hyper-eutectic microstructures. Al11Ce3 lamellae become finer and more closely spaced with increasing cooling rates. Al-9Ce maintains steady hardness at high to moderate cooling rates but shows reduced hardness at lower rates, whereas Al-12Ce shows no change in hardness.With a 15% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, Al-Ce alloys where Ce is replaced with MM offer comparable mechanical properties and enhanced environmental benefits, highlighting the potential of MM as a sustainable alternative.</description>

      <title>Universal MJ Spintronic Model: Navigating a Serendipitous Expedition in the Quantum World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a pair of novel universal MJ spintronic models that precisely mirror the complex spin textures observed in materials. The spin-orbit coupled (SOC) Hamiltonians $\mathcal{H}_{MJ1}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{MJ2}$ reveal a range of novel and intriguing spin phenomena by modulating spin-orbit interactions. These Hamiltonians exemplify two distinct spin textures: $\mathcal{H}_{MJ1}$ distinguishes between unidirectional momentum-independent persistent spin texture (PST) and bidirectional partial PST while $\mathcal{H}_{MJ2}$ portrays a spiral spin texture that can be conceptually tied to the expansion/contraction of the quantum universe in a two-dimensional plane. We also explore the fundamental aspects of earlier analytical models that underpin the construction of the present MJ spintronic model. The physical interpretation of these models is illustrated graphically and the emerging spin phenomena resulting from complex SOC are elucidated using a simple vector model.</description>

      <title>Superconducting flip-chip devices using indium microspheres on Au-passivated Nb or NbN as under-bump metallization layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting flip-chip interconnects are crucial for the three-dimensional integration of superconducting circuits in sensing and quantum technology applications. We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip chip using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built transfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films. We use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump metallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting layer and the indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly can transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest geometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer. We also show that the indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding 1\,A. Our flip-chip assembly does not require patterning and electroplating of indium, nor does it need a flip-chip bonder. Thus, the presented flip-chip devices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting interconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Observation of broadband super-absorption of electromagnetic waves through space-time symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using time as an additional design parameter in electromagnetism, photonics, and wave physics is attracting significant research interest, motivated by the possibility to explore physical phenomena and engineering opportunities beyond the physical limits of time-invariant systems. However, despite significant theoretical promise, the practical realization and observation of many new effects and capabilities leveraging such temporal degrees of freedom have remained elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of enhanced absorption of electromagnetic waves in a continuously modulated time-varying system, exceeding one of the key theoretical limits of linear time-invariant absorbers. This is achieved by harnessing the frequency-wavevector transitions and enhanced interference effects enabled by breaking both continuous space- and time-translation symmetries in a periodically time-modulated absorbing structure operating at radio-frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate broadband coherent wave absorption using a secondary control wave, observing a nearly perfect, reconfigurable, anti-reflection effect over a broad continuous bandwidth. Our findings provide new insights to challenge existing paradigms on the limits of wave absorption and may pave the way to the development of devices that operate in a regime fundamentally beyond the reach of any linear time-invariant system.</description>

      <title>In-Lab High Resolution Mid-infrared Up-conversion Stellar Interferometer Based on Synthetic Long Base-Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting mid-infrared (MIR) radiation has significant astronomical applications, although limited by unsatisfactory MIR detectors. Here we reported on the realization of a MIR up-conversion interferometer based on synthetic long base-line (SLBL) in the laboratory. The experimental system consisted of an interferometer and subsequent up-conversion detection part of mid-infrared signal, which streamlined the structure and enhanced the reliability of the system. By using a tungsten filament lamp as an imitated star, we not only achieved the single target angle resolution of 1.10 times 10^(-4) rad, but also obtained the field angle resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-4) rad of double star targets. The angular resolution is in inverse proportion to the length of baseline. The maximum length of simulated baseline in the laboratory is about 3cm. In a Keck Interferometer (KI) liked program, the base line can reach up to 85m leading to a corresponding angular resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-9) rad (about 1.8mas). The study will offer potential benefits in extending the usage of mid-infrared light in astronomical exploration.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear phase-field model of corrosion with charging kinetics of electric double layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear phase-field model is developed to simulate corrosion damage. The motion of the electrode$-$ electrolyte interface follows the usual kinetic rate theory for chemical reactions based on the Butler-Volmer equation. The model links the surface polarization variation associated with the charging kinetics of an electric double layer (EDL) to the mesoscale transport. The effects of the EDL are integrated as a boundary condition on the solution potential equation. The boundary condition controls the magnitude of the solution potential at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The ion concentration field outside the EDL is obtained by solving the electro-diffusion equation and Ohm's law for the solution potential. The model is validated against the classic benchmark pencil electrode test. The framework developed reproduces experimental measurements of both pit kinetics and transient current density response. The model enables more accurate information on corrosion damage, current density, and environmental response in terms of the distribution of electric potential and charged species. The sensitivity analysis for different properties of the EDL is performed to investigate their role in the electrochemical response of the system. Simulation results show that the properties of the EDL significantly influence the transport of ionic species in the electrolyte.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound is an essential sensing element for many organisms in nature, and multiple species have evolved organic structures that create complex acoustic scattering and dispersion phenomena to emit and perceive sound unambiguously. To date, it has not proven possible to design artificial scattering structures that rival the performance of those found in organic structures. Contrarily, most sound manipulation relies on active transduction in fluid media rather than relying on passive scattering principles, as are often found in nature. In this work, we utilize computational morphogenesis to synthesize complex energy-efficient wavelength-sized single-material scattering structures that passively decompose radiated sound into its spatio-spectral components. Specifically, we tailor an acoustic rainbow structure with "above unity" efficiency and an acoustic wavelength-splitter. Our work paves the way for a new frontier in sound-field engineering, with potential applications in transduction, bionics, energy harvesting, communications and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a fast thermo-optic switching mechanism on silicon nitride on insulator platform leveraging parity-time symmetry breaking. The cladding-free design enables low-loss optical propagation in a partially metal-covered waveguide, with the same metal layer serving as an integrated heater for rapid phase tuning. The fabricated device exhibits an 8.5 {\mu}s rise time for a {\pi} phase shift, despite the weak thermo-optic coefficient in silicon nitride. Additionally, the impact of thermal cross-talk is investigated and an insertion loss as low as 0.39 dB for a 100-{\mu}m-long heater-waveguide section is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>(110) Facet of MgTe Zinc Blende Semiconductor: A Holy Grail for Modern Spintronics</title>

Abstract: Unlike, momentum-dependent Rashba spin-splitting, materials exhibiting intrinsic momentum-independent unidirectional spin polarization also known as persistent spin texture (PST) in the full Brillouin zone are scarce. In this work, a list of characteristic electronic properties for identifying an ideal PST material is provided based on earlier analytical models, and a new semiconductor, the MgTe(110) facet is proposed which satisfies all these conditions and exhibits PST in the full Brillouin zone. The atomic arrangement in this particular facet exhibits three basic symmetries found in nature: rotation, reflection, and translation. Using the method of invariance, an effective Hamiltonian is constructed which reproduces the results obtained using the density functional theory. Further, mono/few layers of MgTe (110) facets of the zinc-blende structure are proposed for a ferromagnet-free non-ballistic spin-field effect transistor (s-FET) that combines both the spin-Hall effect and inverse spin-Hall effect, thus harmonizing spintronics with conventional electronics. Although only quantum well structures have been experimentally studied for nonballistic s-FET under the stringent condition of equal Rashba and Dresselhaus strength, PST originating intrinsically in the proposed 2D structures makes them an ideal alternate.</description>

      <title>Ballistic-aggregated Carbon Nanofoam in Target-side of Pulsed Laser Deposition for Energy Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08957</link>

Abstract: In pulsed laser deposition, along the traditionally exploited deposition on the front-side of the plasma-plume, a coating forms on the surface of the target as well. For reproducibility, this residue is usually cleaned and discarded. Here we instead investigate the target-side coated materials and employ them as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. The ballistic-aggregated, target-side nanofoam is compact and features a larger fraction of sp2-carbon, higher nitrogen content with higher graphitic-N and lower oxygen content with fewer COOH groups than that of diffusive-aggregated conventional nanofoams. They are highly hydrogenated graphite-like amorphous carbon and superhydrophilic. The resulting symmetric micro-supercapacitor delivers higher volumetric capacitance of 522 mF/cm3 at 100 mV/s and 104% retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles over conventional nanofoam (215 mF/cm3 and 85% retention) with an areal capacitance of 134 {\mu}F/cm2 at 120 Hz and ultrafast frequency response. Utilizing the normally discarded target-side material can therefore enable high performing devices while reducing waste, cost and energy input per usable product. leading towards a greater sustainability on nanomaterials synthesis and deposition techniques.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the fundamental limit of quantum transduction via intraband entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09441</link>

Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Reemergence of Trampolining in a Leidenfrost Droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The levitating Leidenfrost (LF) state of a droplet on a heated substrate is often accompanied by fascinating behaviors such as star-shaped deformations, self-propulsion, bouncing, and trampolining. These behaviors arise due to the vapor flow instabilities at the liquid-vapor interface beneath the droplet at sizes typically comparable to the capillary length scale of the liquid. Here, we report on the spontaneous bouncing, trampolining, and hovering behavior of an unconstrained LF water droplet. We observe that a droplet exhibits intermittent increase in bouncing height at specific radii and subsequent reduction in the height of bounce leading to a quiescent LF state. The reemergence of the trampolining behavior from the quiescent hovering state without any external forcing is observed at sizes as low as 0.1 times the capillary length. We attribute the droplet bouncing behavior to the dynamics of vapor flow beneath the LF droplet. We propose that the trampolining behavior of the droplet at specific radii is triggered by subharmonic and harmonic excitation of the liquid-vapor interface. We attribute the intermittent trampolining events to the change in the natural frequency of the droplet and the vapor layer due to evaporative mass loss. This proposed mechanism of resonance-driven trampolining of LF droplets is observed to be applicable for different liquids irrespective of the initial volume and substrate temperatures, thus indicating a universality of the behavior.</description>
